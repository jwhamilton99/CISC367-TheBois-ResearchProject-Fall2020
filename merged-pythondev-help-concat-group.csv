1,1497624694.290598,Melvin,Is it possible to switch between conda and virtualenv? That is I want to switch the actual environment managers not just environments in them … I typically use conda but want to try something out that requires virtual env and is not compatible with conda.  Thanks.
1,1497624934.38474,Beula,"What is it that ""requires virtualenv"", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies"
1,1497625527.626658,Melvin,<@Beula> zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
1,1497625946.790435,Johana,i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.; what have you tried so far?
1,1497625975.802001,Melvin,Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.; Just switch the path/env settings?
1,1497626005.81367,Johana,with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.; so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.; `source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it; are you using python 2 or python 3?
1,1497626165.876875,Hillary,"Conda does the same really, so ```conda create envname``` gives you a conda environment; and then ```source activate envname``` sets it up; you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using"
1,1497626234.903791,Johana,"but i think the issue is with the library <@Hillary>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>"
1,1497626235.903816,Melvin,3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
1,1497626237.904817,Hillary,"but as <@Johana> said, probably best to not try and mix them up; Oh, hadn't seen zappa before"
1,1497626460.991498,Johana,when you do `which python` what comes up?
1,1497626474.996747,Melvin,Normally the conda one.
1,1497626533.019636,Johana,"that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe."
1,1497626547.025256,Melvin,Right… thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:; Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate’ python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
1,1497626620.053156,Hillary,"when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ``` virtualenv envname --python='path/to/python'```; if that helps"
1,1497626694.081996,Melvin,"Yes, thanks <@Hillary>"
1,1497626724.093955,Hillary,then follow <@Johana> advice on activating
1,1497626754.105805,Melvin,conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
1,1497627137.25723,Hillary,related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
1,1497627247.300432,Melvin,Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.

2,1497631714.905377,Rona,vb hell no
2,1497631720.907563,Johana,lol; i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.; i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.
2,1497631819.940685,Rona,anyone who uses macs; this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>; oh wow
2,1497631872.958439,Johana,haha that’s interesting.

5,1497637748.971469,Johnathon,hey guys
5,1497637808.99242,Suellen,hey buddy
5,1497637811.993368,Johnathon,"I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied; any tips?"
5,1497637860.010434,Suellen,compileall?
5,1497637890.020883,Johnathon,yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
5,1497637894.022229,Suellen,oh
5,1497637905.025657,Johnathon,"I also removed the previous .pyc file; before recompiling; apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues"
5,1497638426.198233,Johana,"help is a good channel to ask in n/w.; did you install your package with `-e`?; `pip install -e ""path/to/package""`"
5,1497638866.343855,Johnathon,<@Johana> no; just `pip install mypackage`
5,1497638893.352834,Johana,that would be your issue; -e allows it to be editable; it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
5,1497638952.372421,Johnathon,hmm; so I need to reinstall it
5,1497638999.388056,Johana,you can install it again on top (i think).; but it’s probably safer to uninstall first
5,1497639024.396579,Johnathon,"okay; `mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`"
5,1497639224.462885,Johana,is it local?
5,1497639260.475203,Johnathon,no
5,1497639328.49732,Johana,"hmmm.. this package is on pypi?; you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.; for example lets say this is my project dir.

```
|--- requests
|--- my_awesome_app
```; these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`; i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.; then type `pip install -e ""../requests""`"
5,1497639614.594016,Johnathon,virtualenv?; uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
5,1497639763.644995,Johana,"yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.; if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity"
5,1497639880.683049,Johnathon,does `pip install` look for any particular file?
5,1497639896.687729,Johana,pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
5,1497639912.692882,Johnathon,great; I think I got this
5,1497639951.705221,Johana,":thumbsup:; it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature.; and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you’ll see why this extra stuff exists."
5,1497640116.755996,Johnathon,hey it worked!
5,1497640119.757023,Johana,the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
5,1497641213.079587,Johnathon,it actually really works!; this is going to be my first pull request; thank you so much <@Johana>
5,1497641265.095365,Johana,that’s fantastic. i’m glad i could help.

Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL: .... Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.
but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked."

10,1497715163.442483,Staci,Can you edit an active/open excel doc in python?
10,1497715257.450978,Meg,"whats the use case?; you could, but changes wouldn't be replicated; and trying to keep changes in sync between the excel program and the python program would be a headache; so, I'd say this is something that you could do in theory, but I'd not bother"
10,1497715430.462817,Staci,"Yea, I have a client who wants to add rows to a work sheet as he makes selections and I assume he'd like the worksheet open to see the changes. I told him I could just do it in vba but he'd rather have a separate:face_with_rolling_eyes: program apparently.; How would I go about it, if he insists?; I thought you'd run into the same issue as having a workbook open by two different people at the same time"
10,1497715817.488424,Winnifred,"<@Staci>, I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one."
10,1497715833.489602,Meg,google docs :slightly_smiling_face:

10,1497715902.49405,Winnifred,"haha; <@Staci>, if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>"
10,1497716090.506276,Suellen,"Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents.; And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents; But that's crazy of course."
10,1497716202.513838,Staci,"Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document."
10,1497757140.611201,Alvin,<@Staci> I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.
10,1497764294.880624,Marcie,yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python; it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(
10,1497780664.503479,Meg,"<@Winnifred> not exactly.  xlsxwriter is only for creating and writing to excel files.  It can't open and read from existing files; right there at the top of the FAQ <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/faq.html>; &gt;&gt;&gt;Can XlsxWriter use an existing Excel file as a template?
No.

13,1497791582.978147,See,<@Thomasina> your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.

- if `template1` is `Main` and its length &lt; 10, take `template1`, otherwise take `template2` and check its length and if thats too long, take `template3` (each string can be dynamic, so that sometimes `Main` is shorter and sometimes the last. but it should always start by checking `Main`); (it should be easy for the experts out there but i cant seem to get my head around it - ideally without a `Class` or `lambda` function)"

From the try local it's the `cut -c30`.; If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console).

35,1497992286.658897,Patty,One thing you're doing is changing the value of `post.image` each iteration of that loop; Is it `pass`ing each loop? Do any of those keys exist in `request.files`?; <@Britta> ^
35,1497993434.044706,Mariano,you can add those file fields on your form <@Britta>. Then you can pas the `request.FILES` to the form constructor and it handles that for you.
36,1497995477.644296,Temika,"Anyone know if this is the right shorthand for a one liner? `featured_image=(n == selectedImageIndex)`; n is from `enumerate` and would be `0` `1` `2`, etc. `selectedImageIndex` would be `1` in this case.; Python doesn’t moan but it doesn’t seem to be working"
36,1497996068.805842,Annalee,"Ok, cool. 
I’m trying to learn more about `super()`

Here’s a code snippet I’ve written:
```
class MyList(list):
    def __len__(self):
        print(""calculating the total number of items in the list"")
        super(MyList, self).__len__()
```
And when I instantiate `MyList` I get the following error:
`TypeError: an integer is required`

what am I doing wrong?; Is this the right channel to post novice Python questions?"
37,1497995983.781371,Temika,Sure
37,1497996269.858089,Suellen,"- `super(MyList, self).__len__()`; + `return super(MyList, self).__len__()`; actually, what Python version are you targeting?; `return super().__len__()` is much nicer :slightly_smiling_face:"
37,1497996363.881929,Temika,Instantiating in Python 3 with that code would be fine I think? But trying to do `x = MyList()` `x.len()` would return `AttributeError: 'MyList' object has no attribute 'len'`
37,1497996380.886147,Annalee,I’m using Python 2.7.x
37,1497996391.889176,Suellen,"... come to think of it, if you don't do any processing at all, you can just skip this method; if you don't implement it yourself, an original one will be used from `list`"
37,1497996443.902061,Annalee,well I’m just practicing with `super`. Let’s say I want to log or print before `__len()__` is executed; ok why do I have to use `return`?
37,1497996603.941253,Temika,You’re saying return the result of my parent classes `len` method.
37,1497996701.964742,Annalee,"ok so I did this as well but no return was necessary:
```
class MyDict(dict):
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        print(""adding key: {} and value: {}"".format(key, value))
        super(MyDict, self).__setitem__(key, value)

    def __getattr__(self, key):
        if key not in self:
            return 'key not recognized'
        else:
            return self[key]

```"
37,1497996738.973465,Suellen,`setitem` doesn't return anything useful; and there is a return statement in your `getattr` :))
37,1497996932.019286,Annalee,ah I see
38,1497997608.172952,Simon,What is the best way to convert a list to a dict? The only thing is I want to specify my keys from outside the list. So the list is basically the values of the dict and I will provide the keys separately.
38,1497997669.186401,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; values = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; keys = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(keys, values))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

39,1498017886.153047,Beula,"<@Blossom> I think you have a type-o in your question:

```
activate_this = os.path.join( PROJECT_DIR, 'env/shinra/bin', 'activate_this.py'$

The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error"
39,1498017957.161985,Blossom,"oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!"
39,1498017980.164867,Beula,"Otherwise, some questions:

1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH
2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?"
39,1498018049.173192,Blossom,ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra; I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance; And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
39,1498018452.219848,Beula,"If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn ; <https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>"
39,1498018597.236044,Blossom,"Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great; My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?; But now that I remember I couldn't do both at the same time, I could only run gunicorn when nginx was stopped and viceversa; I'll do everything again from scratch and see if I manage to work around it now with gunicorn and nginx"
39,1498019178.301718,Beula,"Sounds like you're competing for ports and running into collisions. Nginx should handle 443 and 80, and forward to the ""upstream"" port (if using gunicorn) used by gunicorn (the `-b` flag can set this); With Django it's also pretty much required to use nginx (or another webserver) to serve the static files (created via `./manage.py collectstatic`)"
39,1498019488.336652,Blossom,"yeah I thought as much, so I began from scratch and was able to put my app up using `gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 shinra.wsgi`; now, having that, do you have any resource I could use (that could work with either 1.10 or 1.11 and python 3) for setting that up with nginx?; ah.. here is where I got stuck; <https://pastebin.com/r8MrQAPi>; Thats my bash script, I never got it to work haha; Does anyone know how make gunicorn use the python from my virtual environment? for example: `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/python /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi`; running `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi` only works inside my virtual env and not with supervisor; never mind, I got it to work now, my directories were all wrong"

41,1498046288.744474,Meg,I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier
41,1498046327.753372,Holli,<@Meg> so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
41,1498046330.754053,Meg,"and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration; so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc; and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different"
41,1498046403.77117,Holli,ok
41,1498046411.774002,Meg,have you done anything like this before?
41,1498046419.77599,Holli,"no thats why im kind of confused; ive been able to feed data into my react components; but now posting to the django setup; its not so clear in my mind; im going through the DRF tutorial; dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?"
41,1498046482.792508,Meg,"correct; and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation; which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation"
41,1498046561.811917,Holli,ok; so all that classic jazz if request.GET; etc.
41,1498046596.820788,Meg,out the window
41,1498046618.826127,Holli,"Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google; brings up different stuff; a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work"
41,1498046668.838122,Meg,"server side or client side?; I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good"
41,1498046686.842496,Holli,yeh perhaps client sided; sending the post request to the DRF API
41,1498046698.845299,Meg,ah ok
41,1498046698.845399,Holli,processing it
41,1498046726.852264,Meg,"<https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>; so that would help client side; server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending; and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance"
41,1498046765.861701,Holli,yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database; thanks for the help though; it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF
41,1498046789.867311,Meg,"yeah; and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you; so you can send in a model representation via json from your client; and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with; and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON"
41,1498046888.891465,Holli,"ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data"
41,1498046902.89491,Meg,"correct; or get, put, etc"

44,1498050674.974243,Collette,`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` is good at queuing when you don't need ETA scheduling
44,1498050932.063476,Rolland,"So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?; I like that."
44,1498051113.126491,Beula,"Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple"
44,1498051198.157093,Rolland,"ah. gotcha.; I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route.; Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?"
44,1498051515.271654,Beula,"Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc; Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler "

45,1498056455.337872,Romona,"hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data.

Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets?

1. Django ORM
2. SQL alchemy

"
45,1498056525.369425,Dave,SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.
45,1498056594.400579,Romona,<@Dave> thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.; would like to move to postgresql.
45,1498056673.435676,Meg,"yeah, will be cheaper in the long run; no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:"
45,1498056683.440036,Dave,<@Romona> <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>
45,1498056776.482672,Romona,how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?
45,1498056780.484897,Johana,if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.; and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.; i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.
45,1498056862.522493,Gabriele,"I think ""performance on large data sets"" and ""ORM"" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance."
45,1498056869.525442,Meg,"^; and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data"
45,1498056885.532959,Gabriele,"That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core"
45,1498056893.536688,Romona,Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.
45,1498056903.541345,Gabriele,"But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat"
45,1498056921.549778,Meg,and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql
45,1498056923.550854,Johana,sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.
45,1498057007.58939,Gabriele,"It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB; But if you're doing ""big data"" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter"
45,1498057037.602975,Winnifred,reducing joins helps a lot too
45,1498057061.613681,Gabriele,"yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins"
45,1498057113.637625,Meg,one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access; and then look at it to see if you can improve it
45,1498057126.6434,Suellen,SQLAlchemy can do this too!
45,1498057149.6539,Meg,"by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM; since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same"
45,1498057396.774301,Johana,"yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework."
45,1498057684.904795,Dave,"If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries.

52,1498078981.189477,Winnifred,efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
52,1498079143.244936,Martha,"u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use; actually just with requests even; `requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time"
53,1498080029.524814,Thelma,hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file; I was thinking of writing it into a csv; where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
53,1498080250.59194,Beula,"<@Thelma> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object; You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again"
53,1498080286.60283,Thelma,yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
53,1498080396.636405,Beula,Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
53,1498080424.64507,Thelma,yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
53,1498080449.652637,Martha,how big is the file
53,1498080511.670855,Thelma,its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
53,1498080514.671682,Martha,dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
53,1498080602.698747,Thelma,"oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object; thanks  guys!; hey guys I have a quick question 
```
dict = {....}
keys = dict.keys()
values = dict.values()
dict2 = dict(zip(keys,values)
```
will dict and dict2 be the same always?"
54,1498086004.993729,Dorothy,"since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values; this is my best guess; contents and keys i'm confident in; ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same; I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem; if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`"
54,1498089433.589685,Patty,"Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@Dorothy> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results "

I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object.

I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that I’m aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of it’s users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?"
58,1498125511.423899,Ciera,how many button are there on a controller ?
58,1498125634.457854,Timothy,"Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D"
58,1498125643.460257,Suellen,This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.
58,1498125781.495622,Timothy,"True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult"

58,1498126148.585573,Timothy,I should imagine so yes
58,1498137122.179068,Patty,<@Timothy> you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie; also THANK YOU for adding something that is MUCH NEEDED in emulation station; <@Timothy> :taco:
58,1498142220.201185,Timothy,"<@Patty> you sound like you have the same setup as me, wireless logitech keyboard and snes usb controller. I think that’s probably the way I’m going to do it. Have it determine whether to use keyboard or on screen and then create an onscreen keyboard if it’s a controller."
58,1498145871.818831,Meghan,"I guess I'm late to the retropie discussion, but I would aim for as simple as possible. Assume the user an NES control and nothing more, and if possible avoid an onscreen keyboard, because those are always a pain.

I have an HTPC with a logitech keyboard/touchpad that I use in addition to a XB One control, but I would guess this is the exception rather than the norm. And, it's not retropie, so I like being able to use a browser and other things."

66,1498258450.268992,Patty,Are you more concerned with the extension itself or what kind of file it is?; Because you can get a lot from the `Content-Type` header when you make a request to it; Unless you only have strings that are the URLs; And if you go that route the `mimetypes` module can guess and extension from that

72,1498461860.832948,Mirna,Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
72,1498461914.841904,Ruben,"I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).; However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!"
72,1498462467.938809,Collette,<@Mirna> is this some sort of single page web app?
72,1498462668.973866,Mirna,Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.; But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow; one minute they can only render 5-6 page; Which cannot serve my purpose
72,1498462753.988975,Ruben,Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?
72,1498462830.003203,Collette,<@Mirna> can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
72,1498462944.023339,Mirna,Can i make DM with you <@Collette> ?
72,1498462991.031778,Collette,Let's keep our conversation public; I'm not the only one who can help you
72,1498463104.052317,Mirna,"Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel.
So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.; So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.; My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.; But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production"
72,1498463239.077899,Collette,"Yeah, you said that a couple of times already."
72,1498463290.087052,Tresa,and not the only who need to solve it
72,1498463301.089166,Collette,<@Mirna> have you seen my previous question?
72,1498463542.135628,Mirna,"Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.; <@Collette> and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue."
72,1498463657.158505,Collette,"You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?; You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from ""Network"" tab; That's pretty much it"
72,1498464028.236368,Mirna,Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.
72,1498464163.266386,Collette,"You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes.
If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever"
72,1498464292.293463,Mirna,"Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already."
72,1498464502.338826,Ruben,"<@Mirna> Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?; I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup."
72,1498464801.400498,Mirna,"Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered.
I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better"
72,1498464845.409858,Suellen,"sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine; on a second-to-largest GCC instance; also, headless chrome :heart:"
72,1498465196.486388,Mirna,I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.; I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that
72,1498465220.491782,Suellen,how many cores on these machines?
72,1498465238.495966,Mirna,8 cores.
72,1498465261.500796,Suellen,10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:
72,1498465330.515646,Mirna,Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it; :slightly_smiling_face:
73,1498469521.483939,Meg,"so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems; not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now.  given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction; however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out; and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances; just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.; <@Mirna> what instance size are you running this on, and what provider?  AWS, GCC, Azure?"
73,1498470009.595895,Mirna,It’s running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.
73,1498470174.63361,Meg,then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware; because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that

93,1498640744.281519,Venita,"Hi guys. There is one site that returns response in string like: `{""ConsignorName"": ""first part ""second part""""}` which should be json. Result should be `{'ConsignorName': 'first part ""second part""'}`. And I can't just `json.loads(data)` because it fails with `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter:...`.  So I somehow need to cast this string in dict. Maybe u know some easy fast pythonic way to do this? So far I came up with blunt operations with split and check for double quotes inside double quotes and u can see it's already getting boring and I'm gonna stop right here :sweat:"
93,1498641168.391252,Gabriele,"It is actually broken JSON, so I'm surprised that it returns it. You can `strip` the { and }, then use `split` on the "":"", and you should have the key and the value"
93,1498641420.454593,Venita,"Ikr, I was like ""how does it even work??"" Someone definetaly needs to reformat their data... :sigh:"
93,1498641668.516764,Ruben,Probably they're not using a json library to generate that output. I guess they're just concatenating strings and hope for the best.
93,1498641720.53014,Tresa,they can replace unicode quotes after converting it into string
93,1498641751.538099,Ruben,These people would write `&lt;consignorname&gt;&lt;first&gt;Jan&lt;second&gt;de Vries&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/second&gt;&lt;/consignorname&gt;` if they were to output XML ;-)
93,1498641938.586538,Venita,U know the funny thing? They return xml and inside that xml is a string that should represent json. Like wtf :laughing::sweat_smile:; I'm surprised `requests` can even parse that
93,1498642427.716094,Ruben,"I recently scraped an angular website which also did something like that: a response which is a HTML fragment of a page, with a DIV in it that contained JSON. And in that json data was a string field filled with serialized json! It's like a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll>; Anyway, with a few calls to BeautifulSoup and json.loads() I finally got to the data that was needed."

97,1498678667.202997,Gabriele,If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually

97,1498678903.284293,Gabriele,You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st; no problem

113,1498814757.55143,Ciera,yeah that's what I was referring to
113,1498814785.557995,Ruben,...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.; I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.; <@Ciera> So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.
113,1498815078.630666,Ciera,we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example)
113,1498815103.636597,Suellen,"&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway
Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause"
113,1498815179.655402,Ciera,you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row; if you have read only data for example
113,1498815260.674541,Ruben,"Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed."
113,1498815320.689262,Suellen,I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app; even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow
113,1498815388.705792,Ciera,if your db is on the network you gain a bit; but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have

117,1498854661.911579,Ciera,nice spot
117,1498854961.993005,Beula,"<@Sherry> - consider using some virtualenvs to avoid this in the future :slightly_smiling_face:; I will work on a video for that, it's been coming up a lot recently"
117,1498855050.016778,Johana,ooo we can add it to the learning resources.
117,1498855156.044543,Sherry,"ahh i figured it out, i used pip3.5, which i’ve never used before; I’m getting a new computer in a few days, how can I prevent myself from having 7 different python versions?; and yes, I was setting up the virtualenv wrapper but ran into an error doing so"
117,1498855198.056056,Johana,"what model mac, windows, etc.?"
117,1498855231.06516,Sherry,mac!
117,1498855240.0675,Johana,on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don’t want to use system python for anything.; then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.
117,1498855261.073457,Sherry,ahh ok
117,1498855268.075309,Beula,"Yeah, mac is popular enough I can focus on it. Then I can learn windows :stuck_out_tongue:; I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free"
117,1498855285.079979,Sherry,Thanks!!
117,1498855286.080242,Johana,windows you just install python from the msi.; and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.
117,1498855298.083655,Sherry,Yah i’m trying to install virtualenvwrapper; but am getting that; my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
117,1498855374.103468,Johana,your going to want to add some lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
117,1498855404.111211,Sherry,"it’s different if i’m using zsh, correct?"
117,1498855427.117156,Johana,"```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.environments
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```; something like that; yea you put it in your zshconfig however you have that setup.; i load my zsh config via my own script that i call at the end of the config zsh uses.; `WORKON_HOME` is the dir where all your virtualenvs are installed when you write the `mkvirutualenv` command"
117,1498855556.151833,Patty,Just the last line should be sufficient 
117,1498855584.159535,Johana,i trimmed it down to those two.
117,1498855599.163499,Patty,Sorry spotty internet the rest of it popped through haha
117,1498855641.174711,Beula,"yeah, `~/.zshrc`"
117,1498855642.174788,Sherry,Done!; got it
117,1498855648.176547,Beula,:thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
117,1498855658.179227,Sherry,so now no need to run this?
117,1498855662.180114,Patty,I wish more shells had bash compatibility layers like `fish` does 
117,1498855708.192269,Johana,the last two lines you paste into your shell config
117,1498855722.195978,Sherry,yup
117,1498855729.197948,Johana,you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn’t too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.
117,1498855737.200026,Sherry,ahh ok; thanks!
117,1498855759.205569,Johana,if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.
117,1498855762.206224,Sherry,"It’s bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?"
117,1498855766.207323,Johana,"on a mac you can install that with brew. it makes everything super easy.; dang, want to see how things get dated over time? this is a super simple ansible playbook for installing virtualenvwrapper from a yr ago. <https://gist.github.com/mikefromit/4281f29013fe3b4306a87cb64a2ad1fd>"
117,1498855960.259582,Sherry,"virtual environments are extremely cool, but they definitely have a learning curve to them"
117,1498855963.260359,Johana,"lots of things have changed in ansible now.; yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started.; i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those."
117,1498856013.273764,Sherry,why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?
117,1498856025.277048,Johana,i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.; lol; when you need to manage python versions.
117,1498856041.281327,Sherry,haha ouch; my first push had my twitter app tokens!
117,1498856087.293375,Johana,yea that was bad. i’ve never done that but i’ve done some google hacks to look at when ppl did that.
117,1498856117.301345,Sherry,"Haha yah, luckily it was just a monitor i was setting up."
117,1498856157.31183,Johana,i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.; i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.
117,1498856221.329042,Patty,Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess
117,1498856321.356086,Beula,If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion
117,1498856366.368038,Patty,Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is
117,1498856475.398936,Beula,"Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why"
117,1498856521.411199,Patty,Yeah was just realizing that
117,1498856540.416463,Sherry,Node is fun but callbacks are a headache haha
117,1498856552.419409,Beula,"Yeah, maybe that works - but then why bother with developing in docker?; callbacks are getting less and less common <@Sherry> , at least! :slightly_smiling_face:"
117,1498856602.432577,Patty,Current LTS of node has promises by default ; I'd call callbacks dead :)
117,1498856624.438201,Sherry,I’ve heard! they’re very confusing at first
117,1498856632.4405,Patty,Next LTS has `async/await`
117,1498900409.957812,Huong,I m new to python community and has not worked much; And also clustering
118,1498856290.347727,Patty,Is pyenv still used a lot?; Unless you do a virtualenv in the root of the project?
119,1498900433.95916,Huong,Can someone suggest me some tutorials to help me start with data mining ?
120,1498905469.257209,Magdalena,anybody know how to intercept a form submission event? I can't seem to figure out how to target the submit event or bind a click event to the form submission button
120,1498909284.4861,Ruben,<@Magdalena> something like <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5384712/capture-a-form-submit-in-javascript> ?
121,1498923298.536911,Alba,Hey guys what are the best books to read regarding Python for fundamentals. I know for Django its two scoops
121,1498923393.545227,Ruben,<@Alba> Do you already know how to program?
121,1498923452.550317,Alba,Yeah. Looking for something more design focused and best practices; Currently reading idiomatic python; But that's more of like a skim
121,1498923498.55459,Ruben,"Ah ok. I came from C++ a long time ago, and I found the standard Python tutorial quite a good read. And I found some 'Python for C++ programmers' online texts."
121,1498923624.565305,Alba,Not a big cpp fan haha
121,1498923691.570875,Ruben,I had no choice.
121,1498923742.575029,Beula,Effective Python is good

121,1498924771.66358,Alba,Will take a look at both of those books :)) hopefully I can find a free download. The fluent python one is an early release; Meh I think the early release will be fine; Thank you very much <@Rickey> !
121,1498930588.175811,Rona,hola oclay que bola; que pasa; tambien eres programando del python
121,1498932246.315526,Johana,at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.
122,1498927839.933823,Magdalena,<@Ruben> thanks for the link! do you know if it's significantly different than if I use jquery to do this? I had trouble with targeting the correct element 
123,1498931984.292044,Odell,"Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. 
Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?"
123,1498932215.312832,Johana,flask
123,1498932252.315989,Beula,"+1 for that use case; Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events"
123,1498932397.328711,Johana,i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.; <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>
123,1498932512.338352,Odell,<@Johana> Can you tell me more about it?
123,1498932581.344069,Johana,i’ve built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.; you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.; not sure how you’re trying to check out these events.; we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.
123,1498932695.35358,Odell,"I will log request, pageviews and other user actions."
123,1498932714.355073,Johana,do you have any experience with flask?; or python web frameworks?; i try not to assume things.
123,1498932750.358323,Odell,Yes I've decent experience on django
123,1498932762.359309,Johana,k; just a sec let me bust out a code sample.
123,1498932797.362164,Odell,I can learn flask fast; pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:
123,1498932913.371566,Johana,i also had to get my kid off of the table.
123,1498932983.377571,Odell,okay
123,1498933021.380533,Johana,for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you’ll need some sort of middleware. i’m not talking about that part. what i’m showing is how to get data into elastic search.; once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.
123,1498933063.383952,Odell,ok; Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:
123,1498933260.400789,Johana,"ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved."
123,1498933309.40491,Odell,ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:
123,1498933424.414193,Johana,"dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol; either way, in flask you’ll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search.; when your app starts up.; there may be a flask-extension for it already; where you can simply add in the right settings."
123,1498933563.426163,Odell,ok then
123,1498933915.455871,Johana,i’ve updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.; oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>
123,1498934131.473999,Odell,You used Flask + ES + Kibana?
123,1498934161.47613,Johana,no kibana; in my project recently.; my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask
123,1498934206.479608,Odell,How did you build dashboard?
123,1498934371.492596,Johana,i built the dashboard with kibana.; flask is only involved in this process b/c it’s generating the event.; i’m just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.; hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.; it’s nice mapping a document to a class.
123,1498934609.510865,Odell,"Yeah, that will be nice."
123,1498934647.513666,Johana,i know it’s a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.
123,1498934683.516799,Odell,i've few questions.
123,1498934705.51876,Johana,k
123,1498934779.524894,Odell,"Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.; Is it something like this - 
1. User creates an event.
2. Flask view logs data in ES.
3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.; Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?"
123,1498935563.585652,Johana,you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.
123,1498935668.595267,Odell,"I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/>
They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture; ES will be better than this?"
123,1498935894.613805,Johana,"oh idk about that. i haven’t used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”."
123,1498936152.63477,Odell,"okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided.; One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?"
123,1498936225.64071,Johana,"yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.; do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?; or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?"
123,1498936389.653608,Odell,I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.
123,1498936430.657035,Johana,<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>
123,1498936610.671127,Odell,cost involved?
123,1498936660.6751,Johana,oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.
123,1498936680.676559,Odell,How many VMs you used?
123,1498936914.695007,Johana,there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.; it’s been a few years now. i’ve slept since then and don’t remember all the details as i’m not involved in networking admin anymore.; <https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>; i remember our biggest problem was storage.; there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.; the one big gripe about ES is that it’s easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.; for logs we didn’t care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.; you can also get ES running super quick with docker.
123,1498937439.735532,Odell,Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?
123,1498937527.74241,Johana,"well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.; it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.; this is my docker-compose.yml for ES:
```
version: '3'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200'
```

you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you."
123,1498937781.76276,Odell,"So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?"
123,1498937822.766205,Johana,i don’t know what you should do b/c i don’t know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:; &gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.
123,1498938079.786309,Odell,"Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?"
123,1498938170.792964,Johana,"yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{""id"": 1, ""name"": ""a1gupta"", ""role"": ""1"", ""created_on"": ""2017-10-11 343434""}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.; that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint."
123,1498938664.830247,Odell,Thanks <@Johana> . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:
123,1498938726.834759,Johana,code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.; i’m sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.; ppl in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel would know.
124,1498958132.046642,Elane,"I have something seemingly complex and puzzling. I’m trying to add dynamic localization to my library which also powers a REST API. I was able to add the gettext _() function by running this at my root before importing the other modules

```
LOCALE = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'locale')
gettext.install('app, LOCALE)

from app import foo, bar
```

That works great. However, I want to add dynamic localization for certain functions. Ex:

```
# Using system
foo()
# Using given locale
foo(lang='es')
# Goes back to system
foo()
```

I’m trying to do this by running within a context switcher:

```
@contextmanager
def set_language(lang: str=None):
    # Set language
    if not lang is None:
        gettext.translation('app', LOCALE, languages=[lang], fallback=True).install()
    yield
    # Revert to system default
    gettext.install('app', LOCALE)

def foo(lang: str=None):
    with set_language(lang):
        print(_('Foo the bar'))
```

But I’m getting this opaque error and can’t figure out how to isolate it

```
print(_('Foo the Bar'))
TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
```

The interesting part is that it works on the first call to foo but not the second. My guess is that something is going on after the `yield` which screws the system up, but I’m not sure where, why, or how to ask the right question; OH MY GOD. I’ve been testing this in the REPL. I have a function which returns a boolean that gets “thrown away”, but the REPL assigns it to `_` which overwrites the global `_` set by `gettext.install()`; Thoughts on how to make gettext REPL-safe?"

132,1499083058.644476,Ciera,that's not a silly question. It's the id of your bot that slack return when you use <https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect>; or `rtm.start` it's useful to filter message coming from your bot; but normally they shouldn't need it as they can easily retrieve it for you; yes. you can add a `finally` if you want a piece of code to always be executed; it depends on the what but in some case it can overlapp yes
133,1499087391.201023,Susann,"this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?; I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens; so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something; what I'm trying to do is test the correct exception is thrown/handled; so I was thinking..."
133,1499087732.341793,Suellen,`as new_object` looks strange to me
133,1499087748.348469,Ciera,If you are testing code I believe both pytest and unitest have special context manager to test errors
133,1499087754.351171,Suellen,"just do
```
with self.assertRaises(URLError):
    new_object = NewObject(param_to_cause_exception)
```"
133,1499087759.353128,Susann,yah that is unittest
133,1499087763.35519,Suellen,"also, don't test anything else in this function; you're testing only the fact that wrong URL causes an exception"
133,1499087793.367359,Ciera,in that case if the assert is correct the test will continue as expected
133,1499087796.368569,Susann,with the `as new_object` I can pass it through the rest of the code as an exception object which I found here<https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises>
133,1499087801.370825,Ciera,but <@Suellen> make a good point; oh ok. You want to test what is in the exception ?
133,1499087824.380404,Susann,thanks <@Suellen> that does make sense; right; and how the rest of the code responds to that <@Ciera> if that makes sense
133,1499087865.397414,Ciera,both object have the same name that's a little confusing; you can interact with the exception after the `with` like any other object. For example to check what's inside
133,1499087919.419348,Susann,"right, check error codes and such; I think I was incorrectly thinking of how the object would be handled if an exception was thrown (not under test); in my test I am asserting the correct exception is thrown given a bad parameter; I think I've got it from here thanks guys <@Suellen> :taco: <@Ciera> :taco:; I think I just gave you guys 2 tacos each but you guys were great so keep 'em"

144,1499262845.415093,Beula,"If you're on a Windows domain you can do more, but that's a bit specialized"
144,1499262847.416224,Junita,"can you run custom code on the wifi router?  you might be able to have it regularly send its ip; when it updates you might have a moment where the site isn’t accessible, but it might do the trick."
144,1499263106.570469,Hyman,My problem now is to authenticate a person from it's IP address since I don't want to change even the website code
144,1499263134.58767,Meg,"why?; ok, better step back and describe things in more detail; because it sounds like you're trying to do some things that are not advisable"
144,1499263280.679291,Patty,"and depending on how secure you want this, IP whitelisting may not be the best bet"
144,1499263301.692258,Meg,"since you can spoof and use VPNs, and more"
144,1499263333.711202,Gabriele,"Have the site listen on 2 network interfaces, one inward-facing to your network, one outward-facing to the internet, and the inward facing one can use different auth criteria"
144,1499263573.85451,Hyman,"<@Meg> Let me explain it more detailly; There is a website that I am setting up and i want to grant direct access to persons i a given location that is persons connected to my WiFi. If a person is connected to my WiFi, he can access the website with no problem, but if he is not in my WiFi, he should enter a passcode before proceeding to the site's content"
144,1499263775.97306,Meg,"why do you want to have such a huge hole in your authentication; just have them sign in; and keep a session cookie active for them; and so when they re-access the site, their login session is still active"
144,1499263848.017739,Gabriele,"I've seen this sort of thing done before to facilitate company intranets, and that's done primarily just by virtue of listening on an inward-facing network address. But sometimes there is still extra auth anyway, because it's not a great hardship."
144,1499263852.0199,Junita,Is it the case that it’s irrelevant *who* the user is that accesses content?  i.e. there is no user data specific to a user?
144,1499263860.024588,Gabriele,...also that.
144,1499263893.044988,Junita,"if it’s truly irrelevant who people are, then yeah, I’d combine <@Gabriele>’s comment with a VPN from the wifi router to the network that second interface is on"
144,1499264060.144598,Meg,not a bad suggestion; <@Hyman> do you have the expertise to do this?; <@Hyman> best to say your problem; why?
146,1499272006.012992,Ciera,"what's the best way to join on a string x time the same value ?; like `', '.join('hello' for _ in my_list)`; But it seems a bit overkill"
146,1499272225.134085,Jodie,<@Ciera>: is there a better way than that?
146,1499272265.15595,Meg,`'hello ' * n`; where `n` is the number of times to repeat
146,1499272309.179886,Shelly,But won't it add a space at the end?
146,1499272327.190037,Ciera,"that does each letter <@Meg>; can do that `('hello',) * n`; I completly missed your point <@Meg> in fact :smile:; got it"
146,1499272475.269652,Vada,I feel the original was good enough tbh
146,1499272521.294476,Shelly,Wait. Got it :ok_hand:@ndevox
146,1499272608.340674,Ciera,I hoped something existed for that. I'll stay with the for loop more readable

150,1499279933.283283,Beula,Kind of depends on your locality
150,1499279955.294232,Patty,"its bots to circumvent/deal with purchasing ASAP, including CAPTCHA breaking; <@Sherry> is this what you ask for help with here?"

150,1499280230.436891,Jodie,"<@Patty> : it's legal, just breaks site ToS I think"

150,1499280363.506473,Patty,"its a big grey area, so, yeah"
150,1499280747.7141,Sherry,What? I asked for help with setting up a SSL certificate that has nothing to do with a sneaker group..
150,1499280838.763276,Beula,I think it's more the soliciting DMs for help and such
150,1499280869.780042,Sherry,"Ah, okay. He’s the one who asked if I needed a dev, but there’s not really a need right now.; No worries though"
150,1499281018.859514,Beula,"Okay, generally speaking - the group would prefer to not be used for anything gray-area or illegal, whether DM, public, or private channels"

153,1499348679.436696,Ciera,no problem :slightly_smiling_face: If it's helping you
153,1499348757.481717,Ressie,I am just getting my feet wet with building stuff out of bits and parts i find and cleaning it up for my use.  I am still quite noob. This slack has pulled me out of the fire many times where i wanted to bang my head into the wall
154,1499353323.326225,Franklyn,Question about unit testing and type hinting - is there a simple way to assert that a function call returns a certain type and that there are no other type warnings if return types have already been hinted in the function signature?
154,1499353656.544459,Suellen,mypy probably; It's pretty intelligent in type inferring
154,1499355174.517635,Franklyn,is it possible to run nosetests with mypy?
155,1499358685.638024,Mei,anyone have any recommendations on best ways to test flask api’s?  I am writing an api in flask and want to do unittests on it but not sure the best way to do it with flask
155,1499358718.656412,Signe,do you want unit tests or integration tests?
155,1499358747.672734,Mei,"well this is all sorta new to me as far as testing goes I haven’t done it much in the past but I want to mainly ensure the code works and get back proper responses, etc; since its basically a bot"
155,1499358776.689057,Signe,"So there are various levels of testing. If you want a lot of confidence, you should do `end-to-end` testing; which basically means you spin up your app, then use `requests` to hit the api's and check that they actually work; an integration test would be just calling the handler, not using http. And a unit test would only check the logic of one function alone, as in, the function where the logic is"
155,1499358860.735734,Mei,"yea basically the end to end is what I want; take the code spin up the flask app and make calls to the routes to verify they work; before it deploys the code to heroku, etc; so this will be a part of my jenkins setup; I’ve never done testing in the past lol need to learn how to integrate it into my projects"
155,1499359009.818363,Signe,"Unfortunantly I dont know of any ""api testing frameworks"" in python"
155,1499359019.823914,Mei,its more of how do I test flask
155,1499359020.824193,Signe,but its really not very hard to just write tests that use requests
155,1499359023.825694,Mei,since its a flask app
155,1499359023.825756,Signe,and call your app
155,1499359032.830599,Mei,yea if thats all it is I guess I can do that
155,1499359043.836491,Signe,You also might want to look at: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/>; or ask more questions in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
155,1499359051.841034,Mei,"I was more curious how I test it and where for example where do I spin up the code and test it or does it just do it all local, etc; yea I’ve been looking over that doc; problem is that one is very db driven and I’m not even using a db yet, just want to test simple flask routes, maybe I’ll just go the route of requests; I’ll see what I can find, thanks"
155,1499359125.88134,Signe,if you dont have a DB then ignore the DB code; the rest will still work
155,1499359218.93365,Mei,yea thats why I’m checking it out just wasn’t sure if there was anything else or if this is the only info I’ve asked in flask too; didn’t realize they had a channel
156,1499363356.222131,Meg,"code review help: package all html file keys from a S3 bucket with a provided prefix into a list; so, I have a bunch of websites scraped and archived on S3; I want to get the key names for the html files only, for indexing in solr; this is the naive solution, and while it works, I think it could be improved.  Any options?"
156,1499363693.410526,Shelly,"i think you can use map, Not sure if it would improve the code"
156,1499363711.420779,Patty,"could change line 12 to be `for item in page.get('Contents', []):` or whatever empty iterable you want; saves a line"
156,1499363814.480064,Shelly,"Similarly `if item.get('Key', '').endswith('htm') or item.get('Key', '').endswith('html'):`"
156,1499363914.539053,Meg,I thought of that; but feel the readability is so-so
156,1499363949.559372,Patty,yeah gets a little overly verbose there
156,1499364009.595476,Shelly,"Well, I tried :slightly_smiling_face:"
156,1499364059.625727,Beula,"I like `any(key.endswith(x) for x in ['html', 'htm']):` so you can arbitrarily add more extensions if you want; but neither is ""right"" or better"
156,1499364098.648081,Shelly,I like this one
156,1499364294.760744,Meg,"alright, thanks; It was the nested looping and checks that I was unsure about; wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something more pythonic"

158,1499369315.504478,Meg,this the same thing you were asking about the other day?
158,1499369725.712829,Ressie,<@Hyman> what kinda of enviroment do you have for wifi.; <@Hyman> define single sing on.  To my network ears that sounds like 802.11x; for your needs
159,1499372083.923567,Meg,"got a celery question here.

I have a master task, for lack of a better word, that takes in a list of URLs and chunks it up to an appropriate number of sub-tasks to execute for indexing in a solr server

I'd like to be able to record in the model record for that particular instance _how_ many URLs were successfully indexed.  But as the sub-tasks are executing asynchronously, with no feedback to the parent task, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to update the db on completion of the last sub-task.; Only thing I can think of is for each subtask to increment/update the db record on completion.  Is there a more elegant way to do this with Celery?"
159,1499372234.999028,Beula,"I don't think that is too inelegant, but you could have the parent task get all results of the subtasks by polling them and do it that way - not sure it's much more elegant though"
159,1499372318.040577,Meg,"yeah, agreed; thats about what I was thinking as well; but its pretty necessary for the parent and child tasks to be on different queues"
159,1499372509.139479,Lamonica,Anyone have experience trying to persist CloudSearch/Elasticsearch search results? I am working on a system that maps document ids to search queries so relational data can be added in an RDS. However because documents AND search queries can be edited you need to routinely re-run the search to see if new documents need to be added in the mapping table or delete the outdated ones and the runtime is just going to grow as documents and saved search queries are added.
159,1499372597.185332,Beula,<@Meg> - I don't think which queue they run on matters for getting a result
159,1499372616.195269,Meg,<@Beula> I have to think about the queue and workers getting clogged up
159,1499372634.204737,Beula,"yeah, so the master task blocking them will cause issues"
159,1499372638.20661,Meg,"correct; thus, the different queues"
159,1499372670.223709,Beula,"It would only block on 1 worker; But yeah, in that case - DB increment seems like the option"
159,1499372752.266616,Meg,"alright, thanks; nice to know I'm on the right track :slightly_smiling_face:"
159,1499372804.293746,Beula,<@Collette> - any other thoughts :point_up::skin-tone-4: ?

159,1499373959.894541,Patty,"we have a really bad customer that spams us a lot with bad requests and they seem to do it scripted and its 400 400 400 400 and they dont handle errors in their scripts so it just keeps going; <@Meg> I was going to suggest `on_success` with a handler to write results to the db; you could also get the values from calling it e.g.,: ```
result = task.apply_async(*args, **kwargs)
result.collect() # after processing is complete this list grows```; <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.result.html>; no ruby cant DDOS aws im sure :stuck_out_tongue:; :facepalm:; personally i prefer `on_success`, however i would then make sure that if there is an error that you handle responding with either how many were indexed, or bail the whole indexing out (probably not this because lol solr reindexing speeds); or you can consider ANY indexing a “success” and still use `on_success`; man, i miss my job where i did a ton of celery and solr"
161,1499377157.384827,Meg,"Yeah, I'll probably do that in the master task, combined with polling of the subtasks. When the subtasks complete, the master will finish as well, and then can handle success, failure, etc"

166,1499403488.090515,Signe,Its an interesting idea for a slash command for people to annonymously report digression. Maybe add a feature request in <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> for sirbotalot?

167,1499420385.554172,Mirna,Hi; Does anyone have experience in `protobuf`? I want to know how to map a `dictionary` to `protobuf`. I’ve tried this one : `<https://github.com/davyzhang/dict-to-protobuf>`. But it doesn’t work in nested case.
167,1499420569.618659,Suellen,"<@Mirna>
found in one of my projects:
`from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, dict_to_protobuf`; The library is called `protobuf3-to-dict`; And it handles nested data"
167,1499420619.636118,Mirna,Ah I see thx <@Suellen>
167,1499420747.681004,Carri,There's also <https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/python/google/protobuf/json_format.py#L112> that from the protobuf library
167,1499421046.786726,Thomasina,So I ended up trying to use Flask-HTTPAuth as recommended in this thread <https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/issues/492> however I'm getting `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'as_view'` even with the most basic demo code. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work...
167,1499421094.803829,Mirna,<@Carri> Thx a lot Christ :smile:
167,1499421284.872216,Suellen,"Well, functions don't have `as_view`"
167,1499421370.902574,Thomasina,"Yes, but I'm not sure why it would be doing that in the first place. I'm just using the standard Flask, Flask-Restful, and Flask-HTTPAuth libraries like in the project, but the `@auth.login_required` decorator throws that error. The project linked in the thread uses it in the same way but apparently doesn't have that problem...; I have all the requirements installed so... :confused:"
167,1499421390.909387,Suellen,<https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/blob/ff64cdbef03aa2ce108a7dc06ca336035ec68b70/flask_restful/__init__.py#L444>; Flask-restful registers a view like this; and the view is supposed to be a class; which have an `as_view` method it seems; but `@auth.login_required` returns a function. do you apply this decorator to a class?
167,1499421560.96842,Thomasina,Oh shooooooooooot!! Wow! You're right! I had it on a class rather than a function.; Thanks a million!
167,1499421599.982172,Suellen,:slightly_smiling_face: you're welcome
167,1499421641.999218,Thomasina,"I gotta keep learning, maybe someday I can be as good with Python as you seem to be. :smile:"
168,1499453010.476938,Ciera,Is it considered bad practice to append the working dir to the `sys.path` ?
168,1499453159.551996,Johana,i think it may be frowned upon. i usually try to avoid it but when i need alembic `env.py` to be aware of my metadata i do this so that i can import it and have it do autogenerated migrations. The benefits i get out of that are huge so i think it’s worth appending to the sys.path.
168,1499453311.627559,Beula,"In general cases, yes"
168,1499453316.630258,Ciera,ok. It's the only solution I found for <@Alesia> to import plugins without the need to have them installed
168,1499453326.635293,Beula,`python -m sirbot` would add the CWD; if sirbot is an executable module
168,1499453349.6468,Ciera,yeah but it's ugly :smile: there is a `sirbot` entry point; so it's just `sirbot --config file`
168,1499453373.659112,Beula,then make them pip installable!
168,1499453447.696354,Ciera,yeah they should be but your custom config is also a plugin; so making a `setup.py` and installing that every them you modify isn't very user friendly
168,1499453486.715826,Beula,What's the config look like?
168,1499453497.721295,Johana,ya pip installable would fix it
168,1499453498.721942,Ciera,my solution is to add to the sys path only on `ModuleNotFoundError` so if every thing is installed no problem
168,1499453500.722823,Beula,"Is it not just a yaml in `~/.sirbotrc`; if that works and it makes the user experience better, that's a good solution"
168,1499453518.73175,Ciera,yes but you also need to do your business logic; what sirbot-pythondev is to us; just wanted to know if it was `oh my god never do that` or more `best not to but hey it's python go ahead`
168,1499453808.877745,Beula,"The latter :slightly_smiling_face:; Making a better user experience is worth it if only the library has to deal with it!; Single, otherwise it includes all that whitespace "
170,1499489990.447732,Alba,Hey guys reading some idiomatic Python and saw they had a pattern match on a tuple. Just wondering what `user` would look like here for this to be able to work
170,1499490557.483368,Beula,"It's just iterable unpacking, you don't need the parens even for it. The ""user"" here is some sequence type.

You can do that with dicts I think now, but only 3.6+ retain order"
170,1499490666.489357,Shelly,"try `(name,age) = chase.values()`, can't confirm the order "
170,1499492884.604982,Alba,Thanks guys :)) I see what you mean now <@Beula> and <@Shelly> got it to do what i wanted it to do haha
170,1499493355.631356,Shelly,<@Alba> Are we worth some tacos ?
170,1499493370.632144,Alba,same tacos fam; :taco: :taco: :taco: :taco:; <@Shelly> :taco:; <@Beula> :taco:; haha; what are these tacos lol

something like:

174,1499622795.09804,Gabriele,"That depends on what you mean by fix. If the server is broken and you don't control the server, it's unfixable.

176,1499639405.461634,Meg,and definition of no value is an empty string; or a string with just spaces; or an item of type `None`; correct?

194,1499797179.179392,Margy,"<@Junita> I did more research on my problem. It seems on Mac/Windows, Python enforces case-sensitivity with import at compilation. Because I run Debian in Docker on Mac, Python does not enforce case-sensitivity (it's Debian) but the filesystem is not case sensitive, so import does not distinguish cases. One of my dependencies uses `queue`, which internally imports `Queue`. Without case-sensitivity, it causes circular import, where `queue` imports itself. There are others reporting this type of issue: <https://forums.docker.com/t/python-import-source-files-from-docker-volumns-can-not-distinct-upper-lower-cases-in-lib-name/20527> . I worked around this with a very ugly hack, by appending the path of `Queue` at the front of `sys.path` right before a call that results in `queue` getting imported, and then I delete the path from `sys.path` after. I only need this for development so it seems to be OK."
194,1499797345.27545,Junita,"I’d be shocked if there’s a case mistake in the python standard library.  It was Queue in Python 2, and is queue in Python 3 - are you sure perhaps it’s not an issue of the python version?"
194,1499797663.460713,Gabriele,"Looks like there is some platform-specific case-handling behavior (PEP 235) and it predates things like Docker, so maybe it's not surprising it gets confused"
194,1499797726.498175,Junita,Right but the general issue for people using Docker on Mac is that it’s “Linux” so the file system isn’t case-sensitive.  This isn’t so much a Docker issue as an issue of people being exposed to a case-sensitive file-system
194,1499797742.507508,Margy,"I think the `queue` is for backwards compatibility for 3 to 2; ```

194,1499797997.65909,Margy,"The issue was, that small piece of code tries to import `Queue`, while it itself is `queue`, which effectively allows code to import python2 `Queue` even though they refer to python3 `queue`; But it broke without case-sensitivity; The actualy implementation of `Queue` is perfectly fine"
194,1499798185.768785,Junita,oh - is your python file itself named queue.py?

201,1499857975.345178,Junita,"yeah I actually wrote a little tool to simplify doing that in my python projects: <https://github.com/jimjkelly/yaep>; but the basics if you don’t want anything fancy is just `os.getenv(KEY, default)`; oh, and loading the `.env` file I suppose"

202,1499865592.273496,Thomasina,I'm using Flask and have fallen victim to the surprisingly common circular dependency issue. Do I pretty much have to use an app factory pattern to get around this?
202,1499865750.356682,Beula,"<@Thomasina> pretty much, if you have source to look at we may be able to suggest something else, but my guess is the factory is the simplest way"
202,1499865976.477415,Gabriele,"I also found that it helped to avoid various flask extensions, because they would usually mean dragging in a further dependency on the `app` object to implement whatever behavior the extension added"
202,1499866302.657953,Beula,<@Thomasina> Here is a sample app we deprecated from <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old>
202,1499866465.750136,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Well, my current code works, _but_ I'm making use of `from models import *` and using any other method of import fails. I heard that importing like that should generally always be avoided though. I'm not entirely sure why that is (yet) so I'm not sure if it's worth fussing over or if I might as well continue with it as is.; <@Gabriele> I'm using several Flask extensions, but I suppose the issue in this case comes from Flask-SQLAlchemy specifically. I'm wondering why the extensions exist if they're so prone to these problems though? Is the user just expected to use an app factory pattern? I'm surprised that even the most basic Flask tutorials seem to have this issue. The first tutorial I ever did wouldn't run due to a circular import error, even though the tutorial didn't mention any error and seemed to produce the correct results of the app running as if there was no error."
202,1499866622.840233,Beula,It's discouraged because it pollutes the namespace with everything from `models`; Including its imports
202,1499866628.8436,Gabriele,All I can say is that I stripped Flask-SQLAlchemy out for exactly this reason. Other people managed to coerce it into working. :slightly_smiling_face:
202,1499866717.894236,Beula,"for example:

```
# module a.py
import secrets

def do_thing():
    pass

# module b.py
from a import *
locals()   # will have do_thing and secrets available...!
```"
202,1499866737.905445,Thomasina,<@Gabriele> To be frank the reason I'm using the extension is because it seemed a lot more straightforward to use than SQLAlchemy by itself. Guess I'll have to choose between app factory and that.
202,1499866765.921315,Beula,Any reason you dislike the app factory? I'd say the extension is worth it IMO
202,1499866770.92404,Gabriele,"I have an app factory, and even that didn't solve all my problems, because various functionality likes to have the app at module-level for decorators, etc"
202,1499866838.963691,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Despite being a coder for longer than I'd like to specify, I've never had to implement an app factory pattern, and I'm wondering how much learning there would be. I generally learn pretty quickly but I am on a fairly tight schedule."
202,1499866866.980182,Beula,"It depends on if you need to import the app elsewhere to work with it, I usually avoid that (but sometimes you cant)"
202,1499866896.997665,Thomasina,Also wondering if that is in fact the best move considering what Kylotan said. If implementing the pattern would still leave me with import issues later on...well...it sounds like it could be more efficient to just ditch problematic extensions
202,1499866896.997872,Beula,"In those cases, I use an `init_app` in a module that initializes the top level things that need to be decorated by `@app`; I can't say I have had those issues; You just need to pass the app around sometimes during the startup/bootstrap phase"
202,1499866973.041819,Gabriele,The app factory is really simple. Giving it the name 'factory' makes it sound like some sort of complex pattern but really it's just a function that returns a thing.
202,1499867024.071767,Beula,"Yeah, I added a link to a thread above <@Thomasina> for reference"
202,1499867099.116874,Thomasina,"<@Beula> so to be clear, `init_app` is a method of a module separate from the main module that runs the init code that I'd usually have in my main module, or...?"
202,1499867144.143323,Beula,"Yeah, it's simply a way to lazily initialize other things that depend on the app object; for example, how I do blueprints: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/blueprints/__init__.py#L7>; And how I do the external dependencies (extensions): <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L28>"
202,1499867209.181537,Thomasina,"Yes, blueprints. I see most Flask-based projects on GitHub use these but I'm not using them _at all_. I think I'm probably missing something here."
202,1499867241.200566,Gabriele,blueprints help you keep the `app` out of most of your files
202,1499867252.207025,Beula,"yeah, that will cause you issues. But you can do an `init_app` style like this, rather than importing the app directly (which is probably why you have the issue); to get around it temporarily; but blueprints == important"
202,1499867299.235129,Thomasina,"Ya, even though I don't completely understand it, I feel that I should be implementing blue prints and an app factory pattern asap to avoid even more headaches later on..."
202,1499867335.256714,Beula,"Yeah, they are really helpful"
202,1499867373.279306,Gabriele,It's annoying that this stuff is buried towards the back of the Flask docs (if I remember correctly) because I'd contend it's almost impossible to build a non-trivial Flask app without it
202,1499867393.291508,Beula,They want people to get the initial wins to like it; Part of why I am not using flask as much is that it encourages crap like this: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L39>
202,1499867541.381037,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Ya, it boggles my mind how non-obvious these things are to new users of Flask such as myself. I wasn't even aware these things existed for awhile, never mind that they were at all important."
202,1499867581.404822,Beula,"Unfortunately most blogs and stuff only show happy path projects, few people educate on good patterns"

202,1499867709.482574,Beula,"relative imports are okay, but yeah - generally importing in a function/class/method is discouraged"
202,1499867724.491999,Junita,"yeah, relative imports themselves are actually quite good"
202,1499867737.499958,Thomasina,Do imports by themselves generally have a lot of overhead?
202,1499867748.506945,Beula,relative imports lets you avoid refactor annoyances with renaming packages and such
202,1499867759.513744,Junita,you get to be quite explicit about where you are getting stuff from; in the general case I wouldn’t worry about import overhead
202,1499867804.541908,Beula,"<https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Import_Statement_Overhead>; &gt; import statements can be executed just about anywhere. It's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility and/or reduce initial startup time. Although Python's interpreter is optimized to not import the same module multiple times, repeatedly executing an import statement can seriously affect performance in some circumstances."
202,1499867819.550901,Thomasina,"I imported some APIs within functions because I thought it was kind of wasteful to import - for example - a Yelp, FourSquare, and EventBrite library when only the TicketMaster library would be needed for a certain call to my API, and after learning you can import in functions in Python."
202,1499867849.57,Beula,"It actually does have impact that matters; Ideally you'd only do that at app-startup, not each call (e.g. don't import into an http endpoint handler)"
202,1499867905.605045,Gabriele,"...yeah, I was about to say that. You usually want this sort of thing out of the way at startup time"
202,1499868049.698858,Thomasina,"Wouldn't the result be the same? I mean, at the risk of sounding like an idiot (this is my first PaaS project), every time someone calls my API doesn't `app.py` - in my Procfile: `web: python app.py` - run again and the whole process starts over?"
202,1499868061.707001,Gabriele,"no; At least not usually. Python servers, including Flask, are typically long-running processes. They sit waiting for requests, and when they've finished with one, they wait for the next"
202,1499868115.741269,Beula,"you also want to use gunicorn (or a different interface server); don't use the flask devserver for prod; but the way some of those work is as <@Gabriele> said. Some will restart a subprocess after it's handled some number of requests to limit memory growth, or something similar"
202,1499868231.815478,Thomasina,"Oh no, how do I know if I'm using the devserver on Heroku? It completely slipped my mind and I didn't use gunicorn...so I guess I am? :dizzy_face:"
202,1499868243.823513,Beula,`python app.py` suggests you are
202,1499868305.8629,Thomasina,Well...yes...I think I am. I guess when I was brand new and just starting the project I somehow thought that Heroku would take of the server stuff...guess that doesn't make much sense.. whoops
202,1499868317.871027,Gabriele,"It's fine in the short term if you're still developing or have a tiny number of users, but you'll probably want to test in a 'proper' config sooner rather than later to verify that everything still works; For example, we had big problems when we moved our Flask app to Elastic Beanstalk because it has its own particular way that it expects Flask apps to be structured, which didn't match our existing setup"
202,1499868434.943673,Thomasina,"So - and I still can't believe I didn't already realize this - Heroku runs my project on a server but it's truly a bare server without any HTTP functionality for example, which is why something like gunicorn is needed, right?"
202,1499868469.96597,Beula,they have a load balancer in front
202,1499868476.970168,Gabriele,"No, it's more that Flask has its own built-in HTTP server that is not designed to run at scale, just to service your local developer requests and that's about it"
202,1499868510.991896,Thomasina,"So, without the Flask server running, Heroku would take care of that part? :upside_down_face:"
202,1499868548.015292,Beula,"no; Without the flask server or gunicorn running, heroku would show an error page"
202,1499868612.055258,Gabriele,"Go here, scroll down to ""The Web Server"": <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xviii-deployment-on-the-heroku-cloud>"
202,1499868620.06031,Meg,"so the flow is something liek this

request -&gt; Heroku LB -&gt; Heroku Instance -&gt; Guincorn/wsgi -&gt; Flask/Django; the internal flask http server is not meant for production; its slow, can't scale at all"
202,1499868744.137968,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Haha, I had learned a lot of what I know from that tutorial but hadn't gone through the whole thing. Guess I should've taken time to do the _whole_ thing."
202,1499868748.140357,Meg,thats why you need to have somethign up front to separate into processes and handle concurrent requests
202,1499869924.902293,Thomasina,<@Meg> Wow. That's a super clear explainer! Thanks!; <@Meg> So gunicorn takes care of this process splitting and such?
203,1499868534.006598,Meg,thats what you need gunicorn for
203,1499869490.612825,Johana,i’ve used the factory pattern and blueprints since the beginning with many extensions and never had any issues.
203,1499869549.651388,Zackary,Any preferred web hotels to use for hosting django?
203,1499869731.771928,Beula,"Depends on what you want, there is <http://pythonanywhere.com|pythonanywhere.com>, <http://heroku.com|heroku.com> as two _easy_ solutions (infrastructure as a service); I just use Digital Ocean or AWS (usually the former)"
203,1499869919.898411,Meg,DO for personal; AWS for work; correct
203,1499870148.05161,Johana,"DO for personal but if you are new to AWS you can get a year free of their micro-instances which is really nice.; <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>; &gt; These free tier offers are only available to new AWS customers, and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. When your 12 month free usage term expires or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates (see each service page for full pricing details). Restrictions apply; see offer terms for more details."
203,1499870325.167522,Thomasina,And is the benefit of using blueprints solely to help with avoiding circular import issues?
203,1499870338.175939,Junita,"if you don’t have a lot of experience with all that stuff I’d say Heroku can be a good first step; as matt said, infrastructure as a service makes things nice and easy"
203,1499870372.198198,Beula,"<@Thomasina> - no, blueprints are just a good way to break up your app into components and separate concerns.; They can help with the import issue since you decorate the route with `@bp.route` instead of `@app.route` though"
203,1499870513.291661,Thomasina,<@Beula> the breaking up an app into components thing sounds like good OOP really. So blueprints somehow extend this concept?
203,1499870529.302115,Gabriele,I'd say it's more about general modularity than OOP
203,1499870588.340354,Thomasina,"Ah, ok; Also, I'm using Flask-restful so I don't have any route decorators, instead `api.add_resource(API_Users, '/users/')` :speak_no_evil: Not sure if that makes a difference in your example, <@Beula>"
203,1499870660.388905,Beula,"I am not familiar with that one, but it looks like they probably build on top of blueprints and you have to register the `api` with your app"
203,1499870787.475251,Thomasina,"Register the api? Sorry... I'm not sure if I understand. :disappointed: ""Register""? Which `api` might that be?"
203,1499870826.5017,Beula,"Ah, no you use `Api(app)` or `api = Api(); api.init_app(app)`; That is what I was looking for"
203,1499870869.531345,Johana,"```
api = Api(app)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```; api = Api(app) is registering api with app, no?"
203,1499871023.633909,Thomasina,"Ah, yes, that's right. I guess it's the ""you have to register the `api` with your app""...this is what I'm already doing, right? I'm not sure if it was meant that I need to do this (e.g. I haven't done it) or if it's just being stated that I was required to do this..."
203,1499871213.762705,Johana,"to do this with a blueprint you can do:
```
#extensions.py
api = Api()
```


```
from extensions import api
bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api/v1')

api.init_app(bp)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```"
203,1499871638.061646,Thomasina,"<@Johana> Oh nice! Thanks for the example! Makes a lot more sense to me now.; So I guess I should dive into learning to implement gunicorn, blueprints, and app factory patterns now. Thanks for the help guys! I can't tell you how much I appreciate it."
203,1499871684.09391,Johana,i haven’t updated this in a while but it’s a good approach to using blueprints and app factory pattern. <https://github.com/mikefromit/real_world_flask>
203,1499871757.145866,Beula,"Here is another take, but it's a cookiecutter so slightly less obvious to read: <https://github.com/mrasband/cookiecutter-flask>"
203,1499871805.178566,Johana,mine is slightly based off mattupstates blog article <http://mattupstate.com/blog/how-i-structure-my-flask-applications/>; i asked him tons of questions about his structure in the #pocoo channel on irc.; this was when i was learning flask. i don’t use everything he does.
203,1499871889.235368,Beula,"I guess adding a procfile to either/both would help newbies that use heroku, even if they don't use heroku it at least shows the ""prod command"""
203,1499872043.339644,Johana,flask project structure is interesting and i have found that even my own has evolved over time as i pick up new conventions. i do run several flask apps in production for my organization. one of them runs our biglearn platform and is very similar to the link i posted.; it powers this guy: <https://openstax.org/openstax-tutor>; i don’t mention that to toot my own horn. i just happen to love flask and i want to assure everyone that it can run enterprise level stuff.
203,1499872728.799903,Ciera,Yeah it's not possible
203,1499873056.020575,Junita,<@Noemi> are you running the tests in both instances from the root of the api_tests folder?
203,1499873255.155168,Noemi,"I have a set of UI tests structured the same way using pytest and selenium, I don't have this issue with those"
204,1499871636.059737,Danille,"Guys, hi
I have searched for it a little bit, but still dont find information

When I write a custom path in django logging settings like ‘filename’: ‘logs/main.log’ a error occur saying that there is no such file

Am I really should create it manually? Or there is a way it can be done automatically, if no such file exist?"
204,1499871714.115493,Johana,i had many ideas for it initially but it was pushed up mainly to help someone who had a project structure question.
204,1499872681.767779,Alba,"<@Ciera> re: github api 

did you find out if you can invite a user to a team if they haven't joined the organization yet?"
204,1499872894.911727,Meg,"<@Noemi> no clue. but I would suggest you have your dev and deployment environments on the same OS; and if you can't, use docker or vagrant to do so; then you would avoid OS-distinct issues like this; A possible exception would be Java webapps where you're using Tomcat/Jetty/some other container"
204,1499873127.068517,Noemi,"<@Junita> yes, root of the directory; Just noticed a hint on the pytest output saying to make sure modules/packages have valid python names. What makes them invalid names?"
204,1499873258.156965,Junita,"my guess is there’s something different about the environment, which beyond the general wisdom of OS issues would ensure that general setup is the same (python version, dependency versions, etc)"
204,1499873300.185676,Noemi,"Hmm alright, I guess I'll have to keep looking into it; Same error when I execute the python file directly without the pytest runner"
204,1499874079.707586,Junita,"to a degree that makes sense, `base` is not in the same directory; test runners will usually do a little magic to make all this work though"
204,1499874102.722996,Noemi,"Yeah, the same approach works in my other test suite"
204,1499874110.728069,Junita,"essentially, they’ll add your project root to your `PYTHONPATH`"
204,1499874394.91579,Noemi,That shouldn't be something I need to do manually though right?
204,1499874635.074284,Junita,"no it often is taken care of automatically, but I haven’t really used pytest much because I’m a relic and nobody told me that nose wasn’t a thing anymore"
204,1499875675.757119,Noemi,<@Junita> well I just spun up a VM with the same OS as our dev server and I am seeing the error there too. Now to figure out what's causing it
204,1499875848.864123,Junita,"yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s an environment configuration issues rather than strictly an OS issue, but that does sort of bring out a strength of something like Docker - not just that the OS is the same but the environment is configured the same; because otherwise yeah, you end up spending time chasing down stuff like this; doesn’t resolve the problem though.  :confused:"
204,1499880636.685712,Noemi,"<@Junita> okay, so I think PyCharm must doing something to resolve the import paths for me. The code, which also errors out on the command line of the VM I created runs in the PyCharm debugger. When I print out sys.path I see the path I am trying to import from though, so I really don't know..."
204,1499880673.707908,Junita,"ah, yeah, that might do it"
204,1499880694.720387,Noemi,"But again, I don't know why the same isn't happening with my other test suite"
204,1499880771.766416,Junita,is the other test suite within the same hierarchy?
204,1499881241.040564,Noemi,"Yeah, both on the desktop of my dev box and both in the Jenkins home directory on the dev server; Alright, at pycharm &gt; run &gt; edit configurations if I uncheck Add content roots to PYTHONPATH, it fails from the IDE as well; Now we're getting somewhere; I think..."
204,1499881486.182012,Beula,"Have you tried with `python -m pytest` instead of `pytest`?; That said, with `pytest` you may be better served using fixtures instead of base classes for a few reasons:

1. It doesn't need to be importable
2. It allows you to test the library code and the installed code (depending on how you invoke it)
3. Tests are simpler being functions, IMO"
204,1499881863.405157,Noemi,"From the file I was trying to import into, I commented everything out including the import statement, printed out sys.path and ran just that script from the command line with pytest. Sure enough, the directory I was trying to import from was not there, so it looks like if I want to keep using my current method, I need to add it manually; <@Beula> I have not really done much with fixtures before, but in this case it sounds like it could work since currently the only thing I have in my base are some values and a method that generates a key from them using hashlib; Also, you make a good point about functions vs classes; For tests"
204,1499882007.492462,Beula,"<@Detra> has a book about testing with pytest, maybe worth the look.; The way I like to do pytest allows you to test your app without installing it, and after installing it - so you get a pretty nice dev workflow"
204,1499884059.724827,Noemi,"I am pretty sure I found the problem, and it comes back to forgetting the shebang since I wrote the code originally on windows...."

To work correctly over API I must to get some seurity key over API, that key expires after 2 hours. That script open HTTP server and listen on some address. Because is work as server I have
```while True:
            time.sleep(15)

               collecting data command
                collecting data command````
But after 2 hours I need to start function to collect new API secure key.
How to resolve that ?
I tryed to add variable ```wakeup = time.time()``` and to add in while loop 
```if wakeup - time.time() &gt; 7200:
              api_key()```
but I understand that can’t work on this way. :disappointed:"
209,1499932450.395331,Gabriele,"<@Tristan>  That last way will work, if you do the expression the right way around; `time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time`; another way is just to wrap your usual requests in a function that will request the new API key and re-request if necessary"
209,1499933102.624972,Tristan,"<@Gabriele> How to integrate that in
```while True:
        time.sleep(15)```

The best way is to restart whole script after 2 hours, but I don’t want to use cron.
Do you have some idea ?"
209,1499933218.665782,Gabriele,wrap that script in another script that re-runs it until it's killed?; and just have the inner script quit out after 2 hours. Although I don't see why you need to restart the script
209,1499933450.747046,Tristan,How to integrate ```time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time``` in my while loop ?
209,1499933523.77308,Gabriele,"How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)"
209,1499933652.818088,Tristan,"sorry I’m newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?"

```
if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 7200:

```; You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end"

            get_key()

        time.sleep(15)```

209,1499935748.597643,Gabriele,"ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key."
209,1499935889.652658,Tristan,"I supposed, but how I can to do that in this if statement ?; <@Gabriele>; Can I only to add again ```start_time = time.time()``` in this if statement ?"

211,1499939157.890842,Suellen,Environment variables?
211,1499939421.988532,Thomasina,"<@Suellen> I'm not sure, but checking on Heroku the `app` folder does indeed contain my application and there is no `migrations` folder in it even though the log up there says otherwise.; So if I run the Python scripts while inside bash on the server it works perfectly...weird"
212,1499947041.410639,Meg,I suppose this is one of the reasons why I'd avoid managed PAAS if possible; DO/AWS over Heroku
212,1499947871.691509,Thomasina,"<@Meg> Well, I'm using Heroku because with lower traffic it's cheaper, and because AWS would take longer to learn and I probably don't have enough time with this project"
212,1499947914.706943,Meg,"true, AWS/DO require you to have a good amount of knowledge/time to learn beforehand; and that's a selling point of heroku"
212,1499947968.725643,Thomasina,"Ya, I mean, I will use AWS eventually, but when I have the time to learn its ins and outs. Actually I started with AWS but switched to Heroku once I realized the complexity, haha"
212,1499947976.72821,Meg,but don't forget they're built on top of AWS; so you're actually using AWS services through Heroku
212,1499948019.742642,Thomasina,"I'm surprised they're allowed to make a product with AWS that competes with AWS, but I guess it's because anyone who pays for Heroku pays indirectly for AWS."
212,1499948150.789009,Meg,"correct; and AWS really doesn't care about that; since more customers for Heroku means more services Heroku pays them for; and its a useful service; I think things would be different if heroku were provider-agnostic; eg, pick between Azure, AWS, DO, etc"
212,1499948452.896142,Thomasina,"Ya, that's true; So, after reading up I _think_ I kinda get _what_ a blueprint is now, except I don't really understand _why_ one should use blueprints. All the examples seem to show either very abstract things or super simple things that don't seem to benefit from a blueprint as far as I can understand."
213,1499950378.654586,Gabriele,"I have separate blueprints for standard view routes, for JSON APIs, and for admin and testing APIs. I can quickly turn off the whole admin and testing APIs by commenting out the single line that attaches that blueprint; I can also mount all the routes in one blueprint with a different URL path with just one change"
213,1499950500.706887,Junita,yeah I actually have all of my blueprints feature toggleable by environment variables; and essentially the benefit is modularity
213,1499950707.798373,Thomasina,"I see. Then, I suppose the difficulty I'm having is in understanding how I can use them in my own project. Hopefully it will become clearer after I learn more about them."
213,1499950779.830398,Gabriele,"_How_ to use them is very straightforward. The docs show that. _Why_ to use them is trickier, until you have done enough big projects that you start valuing modularity from the start."
213,1499950983.928863,Thomasina,"Yes, I do value modularity greatly but always felt that the package -&gt; class -&gt; property/method approach was comprehensive enough. Naturally I'm trying to think of something similar to blueprints in any other language but the examples I see for blueprints seem like things that - to me - in any other language could be done just as easily with classes.; And since Python has classes and the like this confuses me."
213,1499951060.965493,Gabriele,"blueprints aren't a language feature, they're a Flask feature; It's giving you a way to make a Flask app out of smaller sub-apps that you might want to mix and match, or change independently; (assuming we're talking about Flask blueprints and not some other blueprints... just noticed we're not in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>)"
213,1499951227.044823,Junita,"I think an important point is that if you don’t see the need, you don’t need to use them.  It’s worth exploring them to know they’re there, but you’ll know when you need them."
213,1499951234.047894,Thomasina,"Yes, I meant Flask. ""Sub-apps""? So would you perhaps say that this is a way of building an app, but having different parts of the app actually be different apps, where each one is coded like an individual Flask app, and then everything is ""plugged in"" to each other?"
213,1499951254.057705,Junita,"If everything is working fine without them for you, there’s no need to over-engineer your project."
213,1499951277.068381,Gabriele,"they're not entirely 'sub-apps' but they are modular parts of a larger app, yes."
213,1499951306.082323,Thomasina,"<@Junita> If I don't implement them now though, and my Flask API grows in complexity over time, will it be a major headache when the time comes to use blueprints though?"
213,1499951325.091411,Junita,I don’t think so.  I refactored some things into blueprints on a previous app and it really wasn’t that bad.; To the extent it will be a pain it will likely be untangling some of the things that have grown to annoying for you; But with a good test suite refactoring isn’t so bad.  So write good tests.  :slightly_smiling_face:
213,1499951478.164928,Thomasina,"<@Junita> Ah ok. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face: Then, would you perhaps be able to give me an example of where blueprints would be very useful? All the examples I see are abstract or purely for example and wouldn't be very helpful in a real-world scenario."
213,1499951532.190742,Junita,"So one example is that as <@Gabriele> and I said, it’s quite easy to “turn on” and “turn off” a blueprint - I literally do it based on the presence of environment variables.; so for example when I launched a product we had an Invite system; which was a blueprint, and we were able to turn on and off the need for invites via a simple environment variable change, no need to rebuild and redeploy.; that’s perhaps a pretty niche example of a concrete use though - I really think the modularity is the real benefit.; Things just are cleaner and easier to work with, reason about, etc. when working with them, in my opinion.   But that’s a bit more subjective"
213,1499951687.26621,Thomasina,Would that be very different from a simple `if os.environ['INVITE_PAGE'] == 1:` in the code for the endpoint where the page would be though?
213,1499951711.278218,Gabriele,you'd have to add that for every single endpoint
213,1499951724.284901,Thomasina,"Oh, good point! (pun intended :wink: )"
213,1499951763.30454,Junita,"Right, as well as any other associated stuff you’ve done."
213,1499952027.437861,Thomasina,"I'm using Flask-Restful which means that the various methods for endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, etc.) are grouped into classes. However it does feel a bit messy since that means `/users/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/`, `/users/auth/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/requests/` and others all have their own classes (some with similar names...I mean how am I supposed to meaningfully differentiate the first two by name?). I'm wondering if this setup could benefit from blueprints in some way."
213,1499952103.476599,Junita,Maybe.  I only briefly messed with Flask Restful so I’m not too familiar with it.
213,1499952350.606681,Thomasina,"I'm wondering if anyone even uses Flask-Restful for complex APIs, or if it's generally only used for simple ones.; Gonna use this <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Testing/> and wondering if it's ok to put my testing code within my app's main script, or if it should be in its own script; So, in its own module then?; `print(__name__)` would print the name of the current...method?...module?"
213,1499962515.005209,Gabriele,It should be the module. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>
213,1499962597.053581,Thomasina,So if my primary application script is `app.py` and I have `app = Flask(__name__)` I suppose I'm setting it to `app` then? I'd test but my code is in the middle of a major change so I can't run it.
213,1499962665.093325,Gabriele,"Yes, unless you're running the app.py file directly"
213,1499962697.11274,Beula,It's best to explicitly replace `__name__` with a string in the Flask initializer
214,1499956790.311894,Gabriele,testing code should be outside the app
214,1499956826.335664,Johana,i use flask-restplus and from what i understand it is inspired from flask-restful.; I believe using a `class` and inheriting from Resource is a the same pattern.
214,1499957000.447804,Gabriele,I usually have my tests in a separate directory alongside the package for the main app. But I don't use Flask-Testing or any other extension so I don't know what that recommends.
215,1499964454.137391,Jessie,"Hi guys! I have launced an aws instance with SES(full access) role, Now how can i send an email to AmazonSES without smtp {username/password} credentials on server. An example in python or any relevant link would be great. Basically i dont want the creds to be on server."
216,1499965948.999447,Thomasina,"```if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)```
So this should not be in the production code, otherwise it'll run the Flask dev server, right?"
216,1499966612.36882,Beula,"No that is fine, that only runs if you directly call `python file.py`; But if you use gunicorn, `gunicorn file:app` it would not run the devserver"
216,1499966665.398893,Thomasina,"Ah, ok. gunicorn runs a specific function unlike Python which runs the entire script...I should've noticed that. Thanks!; <@Beula> In <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/> you have `pyslackers.__main__:app` in `Dockerfile` but in `__main__.py` there is no `app` function. Instead `app` is a variable as in `app = create_app(resolve_config(os.getenv('PY_ENV', 'dev')))`. How does that work?"
216,1499966896.529715,Beula,"Gunicorn uses that as the WSGI gateway, it's the ""callable"" for the spec; So `app` is a `Flask` instance, and that is a callable (per how wsgi works)"
216,1499966965.569963,Thomasina,"Oh, wow. @.@ Every time I think I'm understanding everything there's something new to learn. I'll add WSGI to my list of things to learn more about."
216,1499967019.602467,Beula,you don't have to worry too much about it fortunately - just enough
216,1499967358.80161,Thomasina,"Oh, really? Good to know. Thanks!; Wow. Ya, I expected it to be quite a bit more complicated. Makes sense!; By the way, you have `from pyslackers import create_app, models` in __main__.py but there is no `pyslackers` module...?; I'm thinking maybe this is from running __main__.py directly, and perhaps I need a script to run from the parent folder that acts as the true primary script, but I'm not sure"
217,1499971329.124146,Beula,`pyslackers` is the package the whole app is in; `create_app` is from `pyslackers.__init__`; models is another module
217,1499972613.868383,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Oh ok, that's what I thought but for some reason when I run my app - Broadway - locally with Python I get ""No module named broadway"" from the line `from broadway import create_app`"
217,1499972726.933591,Beula,"yeah, you want `python -m broadway`; the `-m` runs it as a module, executing `__main__.py`; but it sets the PYTHONPATH to be the CWD"
217,1499972916.036122,Thomasina,"Ah, ok! That worked though. Even though I didn't know better I did think that running `__init__.py` or `__main__.py` directly seemed a bit...off. Haha I'm so thankful for your help and this whole Slack. :slightly_smiling_face:; Are Python devs just more helpful people? Seems like it."
217,1499973000.079861,Junita,"We’re more efficient than other developers, so we have time to be helpful.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
217,1499973108.1362,Beula,I am at a ruby job and avoid it a lot
217,1499973113.138633,Thomasina,"Haha, while initially I wasn't crazy about Python, the more I learn about it the more I like it, and one of those reasons is that I feel it can be very efficient, to create all kinds of things rather quickly"
217,1499973158.16205,Beula,"I use the `__main__` trick to get around some annoyances with importing, python pathing, etc. Because with that way, gunicorn can pick it up and I keep the top level directory clean; I hate how the top level directory can get so cluttered :smile:"
217,1499973264.217834,Thomasina,"Ya, the cluttered top level was something that I disliked. Before this I was making apps with Adobe Air and most of the time I'd have a single script in my top level and then have everything else in sub directories which felt really organized. Glad to know how to do this in Python."
217,1499973317.245396,Beula,"I think I may be slightly non-standard in that regard. But since `flask` introduced the CLI, I have been liking this approach.; For aiohttp apps, it made it so I could just have an optional CLI to run the application"
217,1499973496.338741,Junita,flask introduced a CLI?  heh.  here I’ve been making a manage.py entry point for all these years.
217,1499974001.606815,Johana,yea it uses click now.
217,1499974230.729312,Junita,I suppose that makes sense.
217,1499974264.74796,Thomasina,Oh wait...do I not need `manage.py` for my DB deployment then?
217,1499974339.787858,Johana,the click cli in flask supports it.; <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/cli/#custom-scripts>
217,1499974456.849933,Junita,it’s funny because I’ve been meaning to go through the Flask docs again because I knew there were probably a ton of things like that which have changed over the years.
217,1499974936.100445,Beula,"It's pretty nice, for example with the `flask-migrate` extension:


```
export FLASK_APP=website/__main__.py
flask db migrate
flask run
```"
217,1499974995.131144,Thomasina,"So I can use this to make deployment more elegant than having to run `python manage.py db init`, `python manage.py db migrate`, and `python manage.py db upgrade` separately?"
217,1499975001.134028,Junita,yeah I was always writing that stuff myself like a sucker
217,1499975036.152991,Beula,"Yeah, you can make a custom command that does those for you; `db init`, if using flask-migrate, is only a 1 time thing though, just setting up the local config and migrations folder; so neither `db migrate` nor `db init` would be needed during deployment"
217,1499975525.41157,Thomasina,"Oh, nice. Guess I'm kind of micro-optimizing by wanting to combine the init and migrate into one command as well then. Haha"
217,1499975562.431625,Beula,"I do the upgrade/run at boot each time so it's always up to date for prod ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; but init is one time ever for a project, and migrate creates the migrations; so I don't think you need those often enough, those are developer run manually"
217,1499975635.471269,Thomasina,"Ah, ok.; Good point; In `__main__.py`, `from broadway import create_app` results in `No module named 'broadway'`... Hmm... It's definitely the right name"
217,1499975672.49121,Beula,how are you running it?
217,1499975681.496141,Thomasina,`python -m broadway`; From the module's parent directory
217,1499975708.51083,Beula,"and the dirs are:

```
broadway
  - __init__.py
  - __main__.py
```
?"
217,1499975713.513607,Thomasina,Yep
217,1499975726.52055,Beula,python2 or 3?; delete out your __pycache__ dirs
217,1499975784.552528,Thomasina,Same error. :thinking_face:
217,1499975787.554028,Beula,"Oh, there is a `__pycache__` at the top level too - do you have an `__init__.py` in the `backend` dir?; That would cause it"
217,1499975812.567707,Thomasina,"Oh, no but there used to be. It became my Broadway module."
217,1499975828.575978,Beula,"is this pushed somewhere, or a work thing?"
217,1499975876.601433,Thomasina,I'm working on the company repo which I've cloned. The above image is from the local copy. I'm just trying to run it locally on my own PC
217,1499975892.610179,Beula,"Yeah, I was just hoping to see the code to look for anything funky; hmm; and `pwd` has you in the `backend` directory?"
217,1499975916.623221,Thomasina,Could such a thing be cause by a circular import error?; Yep
217,1499975932.631653,Beula,"It shouldn't, you'd probably see a circular import related error in my experience; :thinking_face: not sure what to suggest given what I can/can't see; what's main.py look like? just `from broadway import create_app`?; I think it may be the broadway from the `__init__`, try changing the `import broadway.external` to `from . import external`; external looks ok, the init otherwise looks ok and then in `__main__.py` I think the `.external` may be a problem; Usually in this case, I would comment out pretty much everything in __init__ and make sure that imports. Then start re-adding things; I gotta get back to work, I will check back in a bit"
217,1499976616.99612,Thomasina,"So I commented out lines one by one as you said and found the problem line. It's `app.config.from_object(config)`. The way I have this set up is that I pass in `os.environ['APP_SETTINGS']` which contains the relevant configuration class (e.g. `broadway.config.DevelopmentConfig`), and it's this that's throwing the error. I've tried without `broadway` and without `broadway.` but neither of those are working. Before modulizing this I just used `config.DevelopmentConfig` which worked."
217,1499976719.049794,Beula,"The error is now related to config, not imports?"
217,1499976809.096,Thomasina,"No, still the same error, but if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config)` in `__init__.py` I no longer receive any errors"
217,1499976833.10851,Beula,"yeah, sounds like you just need to change how the config is resolved"
217,1499977455.430751,Thomasina,"Even hard-coding it like `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` produces the same error `no module named 'broadway'` even though `broadway` is not anywhere in the parameter. Again, if I comment out this line, the error disappears. :thinking_face:; `from broadway import config, util` in `models.py` appears to have caused the problem. Specifically `config`."
217,1499977606.508987,Beula,"try relatives for anything other than `__main__`, `from . import config, util`"
217,1499978076.758974,Thomasina,Guess I spoke too soon. I'm not even sure what's going on now. I'm not sure if the line in `models.py` is relevant at all. I just can't get `app.config.from_object()` to work no matter what I provide it with.
217,1499978103.773318,Beula,Even a raw class?
217,1499978180.813481,Thomasina,Yep. `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` causes `NameError: name 'config' is not defined`
217,1499978192.819597,Beula,is config imported?; sounds like not
217,1499978281.865209,Thomasina,"Well, I thought that was the issue, so I tried adding `import config` and now I'm back to the old error `No module named 'broadway'`, referring to `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py`, and if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` the error no longer occurs."
217,1499978329.890479,Beula,`from . import config` is probably better
217,1499978360.906485,Thomasina,"Oh, my bad. Yes it's `from . import external, config` in `__init__.py`"
217,1499978410.932417,Beula,"It sounds like you still have a bad import somewhere, something external or config or something like that import"
217,1499978448.952108,Thomasina,"Changing `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py` to `from . import create_app, models, util` changes the error to `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_app'`"
217,1499978707.087288,Beula,"yeah, because it's trying to import a module, not a function"
217,1499979178.330636,Thomasina,When should I use `from broadway` vs. `from .`? I didn't know there was a difference actually
217,1499979310.398374,Beula,"you _should_ be able to use `from broadway` everywhere, but I am not sure what is causing you issues ATM. the `.` is a ""relative"" import so it just removes any ambiguity of which package you're talking about; But you can't do relatives in something like `__main__` because the `broadway` package isn't initted yet, or something like that; <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime> <@Margareta>"
218,1499974328.781814,Johana,you can still have a manage.py.

219,1499980341.914336,Thomasina,I placed some `print()`s at certain points to see if things were actually executing. After running `python -m broadway` I can see...; `created app` prints _after_ `app = create_app(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])` runs; Why was there no error at the beginning? Is this behaviour normal?
219,1499980401.942848,Beula,"python executes as it reads; I am kind of dumb, but in this case with flask you can do:  `FLASK_APP=broadway/__main__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`; No need for the python -m and such (though that looks like windows, not sure how the flask CLI work sthere); Sorry for sending you on a chase on accident"
219,1499980497.987424,Thomasina,Oh? Was I on a chase?
219,1499980543.00933,Beula,"No, I meant this whole refactor with the `__main__` and such; It's hard when I can't review the code"

241,1500108500.138787,Thomasina,"So, I have an import error that I've been trying to solve (with help from here) for the past two days and still haven't been able to solve. I'm building a REST API and I've put my source into its own module titled `broadway`. I'm implementing an app factory pattern. In `__main__.py` I have `from broadway import create_app, models, util`, and `create_app` is defined in `__init__.py`. These are the entire contents of `__init__.py`:

242,1500117683.664538,Christy,`python -m unittest discover`   What this command do?
243,1500120427.832816,Darnell,"hi,"
244,1500124646.116542,Madaline,Hi is anyone active ?
244,1500124678.118664,Krysta,Does sitting down class as active?
244,1500124715.121243,Madaline,That all depends on the class. :slightly_smiling_face:; I have a code challenge that I'm working on from Google.. they give it to you when you do certain searches. It's a recruiting tool to get candidates for interviews.; I've found a few solutions but they don't seem to be scaling up for some reason.; I have to find the largest number that can be divided by 3.
244,1500124962.138722,Signe,"&gt; dont seem to be scaling up
Can you explain?"
244,1500125002.141551,Madaline,"They give a number 954311
and the largest number that is divisible is 94311; The length of the number can be up 10 digits long.; Mine works perfectly up to 6 but beyond that I think there is an error; My latest attempt was the fastest to execute but failed 4 of 5 tests. I don't get the error from them so I dont know why it failed.; In other attempts it ran slower (I built a set of permutations) and passed 4 out 5 tests.; Knowing that the number of digits in the list can grow up to 10.. my guess is it's not scaling up properly."
244,1500125353.166423,Signe,Tell me what your code does when the number isnt divisible  by 3; In your own words
244,1500125416.171189,Madaline,If the number is not divisible by three it increments down one and checks the next one if that is divisible by three.
244,1500125478.176006,Signe,"Ok. What if the number ""decrement by one"" cant be made with the numbers in the list?"
244,1500125540.180995,Madaline,"Let me explain more. 
First I take the list of numbers and I sort them high to low. 
I join the values together, appending one to the other.; So 5,3,4,1,2
becomes 5,4,3,2,1
then 54321; I then iterate down from the 54321 until I find the first number divisible by 3.; then I return that"
244,1500125640.188869,Signe,"Yes. So your list is [5,4,3,2,1] but 54320 wouldnt be possible because 0 isnt in your list"
244,1500125691.192965,Madaline,The range gives me the iteratable. At that point the list is gone.
244,1500125702.193802,Signe,Exactly
244,1500125725.195561,Madaline,I do see the number increment down and I do get a return result that is divisible by 3.
244,1500125764.198318,Signe,"Ok walk me through the problem in just words and you doing it by hand. Dont use your code. 
; If i give you the list [2,2,2,2,7], what is your process?"
244,1500125852.204441,Madaline,"let's use [8,7,2,6,4] as the 2's will hide some steps; so I need to turn that in to 87642; then find the largest number that is equal to or less then that number and is divisible by 3"
244,1500125929.210188,Signe,"Lets use [8,7,3,6,2] since the largest num isnt divisible by 3"
244,1500125938.210811,Madaline,That's the point.
244,1500125953.211895,Signe,Exactly
244,1500125964.212679,Madaline,It has to be closest to or equal.
244,1500125971.213146,Signe,"So, whats the next number you try?; After 87643 fails, then what?"
244,1500126006.215859,Madaline,"my code is stepping down to 87641, then 87640, etc..; checking each for % 3 == 0; AH!"
244,1500126062.220456,Signe,"Ok, is 87642 a valid answer to the problem where the input is [8,7,6,4,3]?"
244,1500126073.221276,Madaline,I realize where I made one mistake..; OK the number has to use all numbers in the set..; Let me show you my other approach if you don't mind.
244,1500126167.22802,Signe,&gt; finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits 
244,1500126175.228633,Madaline,"In this approach. I take all the numbers in the set and create every permutation from them. Then increment through the new list in descending order.; In this one, I filter the list to remove duplicates.; I also break up the sets by length because I hit a memory limit error on submission. In that case the first hit for 954311 is 94311."
244,1500126327.240025,Signe,Good. Your on the right track. 
244,1500126329.240147,Madaline,"l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]"
244,1500126399.2457,Signe,Large numbers will have a LOT of permutations. So it's probably best to load them lazily rather than making a set
244,1500126424.247654,Madaline,it could be a memory error.. they don't specially say..
244,1500126459.250526,Signe,It could also be an issue with string sorting vs number sorting :)
244,1500126460.250601,Madaline,when I created one big set for all permutations that's when i got the memory error. but this code runs it just fails test 4 and I get no error
244,1500126478.252127,Signe,You might want to try converting every sting into an int before sorting
244,1500126500.253789,Madaline,"That makes sense.; data_set = map(int, data_set) 
should take of that?"
244,1500126606.262028,Signe,"Ya, i think so"
244,1500126694.268625,Madaline,thanks i really appreciate you talking me through the problem.; I'm a product manger.. it's been a loooooong time since I had to worry about code challenges. :smile:; I prefer to be explicit in the code but I don't want to look like a Jr. Do you think there is a better approach?; This code also timed out..; Correction.. I'm trying it with iterator on the permutation and that timed out; I think building the list and then sorting it is the problem.; returning 0 is something I missed. I'll try that too
244,1500137015.167762,Cleta,<@Madaline> why are you using set in line 10?
244,1500137043.170166,Minerva,"what about something like (note: you'd have to re-write to get it to work with a list of numbers as input)
```
from itertools import permutations

def permutation_gen(x):
     for r in sorted([i for i in range(len(str(x)) + 1)], reverse=True):
         for p in permutations([i for i in sorted([i for i in str(x)], reverse=True)], r=r):
             s = sum([int(i) for i in p])
             if s % 3 == 0:
                 yield(int(''.join(p)))

    except StopIteration:
        y = 0
    return y

get_largest_3_modulo(954311)
```"
244,1500137236.187951,Madaline,I had started with a similar approach but their verification tool was not reporting errors properly.
244,1500137298.193357,Cleta,"<@Madaline> sorry, didnt see the new one."
244,1500137311.194499,Madaline,"code that ran perfectly in my Jupyter was failing.. So split it up and simplified it .; This approach looks much better then what I was doing.; This is what I originally tried but I hit memory errors.; In case anyone is interested in triggering the Google code challenge. I've been spending a lot of time searching for Python, crawlers, NLP, analytics, algorithms, etc... This is the second time it came up for me in the last 2 months.. I  was on vacation last time it came up so time ran out.; <@Cleta> I have a quick question about your example. One line 6 there is SUM of the permutation and then you are checking if it is divisible by 3. Then on line 8 your yield is the joined integer. Is this a faster way or an error?"
245,1500136554.127549,Minerva,"for one it doesn't look like your code handles the condition: `If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the answer`; two, i like nhumrich's idea to lazily evaluate, which you could do with generators"
246,1500140004.430596,Deedee,"any number that is divisible by three has the sum of its digits = to a small multiple of 3, 6, 9, ...
So 33333, if added together equal 15, which in turn equals 6; so I would add all elements of list and see if that sum is % 3"
246,1500140030.432628,Minerva,^this
246,1500140098.438219,Deedee,Not sure if that fits
246,1500140153.44265,Madaline,Thank you.. Its funny. I never really have to deal with this type of problem.
246,1500140156.442888,Minerva,"not sure if it is faster than modulo-ing the int, that's just what came to mind"
246,1500140182.445037,Madaline,I can time it and see if it helps performance
246,1500140694.487976,Minerva,"<@Madaline>, just doing a modulo a la `if int(''.join(p)) % 3 == 0:` is a little faster, i'm guessing because the other way adds a list comprehension step. good catch"
246,1500140838.500203,Madaline,Thank you both.. <@Minerva> <@Deedee>.. I think this should unblock me..; Thanks again! Hopefully I can get through the rest and get an interview. :smile:

247,1500146260.963902,Shelly,May be you are using some interactive python shell like Jupyter

247,1500146361.97217,Kandis,i see. so the sorted() does not really have any effect on this dictionary; <@Shelly> <@Cleta> :taco:
247,1500146439.978259,Shelly,"`Sorted` sorts the dictionary based on the keys in increasing order since you are passing the list of keys here, here it is in alphabetical order."

247,1500146490.981921,Shelly,Cool :thumbsup:
247,1500147010.023343,Cleta,"<@Kandis> to elaborate more on <@Shelly> ‘s answer, the function `marks.keys()` returns a list of keys in the dictionary and `sorted()` returns the sorted list. Although why is there a conversion to list when it will return a list anyways?"
247,1500147066.028345,Kandis,<@Cleta> mmm good point..; idk either
247,1500147580.068972,Cleta,"interesting to note is that it doesn’t effect your dictionary in any manner, it will return a list of sorted elements anyways. even if you pass a string to `sorted()` function but if you use the `list.sort()` function , it changes the list."

253,1500220043.233584,Ruben,<@Beula> Thanks for your excellent advice!
253,1500220065.235314,Vonnie,<@Beula> should I install python 3 then?
253,1500220070.235653,Beula,"<@Ruben> :taco: nice suggestion for the op; <@Vonnie> - Python 3 is the future of the language, so it is worth using. But for now, I wouldn't divert your attention from your current issue"
253,1500220136.240721,Vonnie,Ahh
253,1500220153.241964,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> It depends on what you use now. Do you need any Python 3 features for your work that you can't do in Python 2? Eventually, Python 2 will become obscure indeed."
253,1500220163.242798,Vonnie,<@Beula> I will keep that in mind 
253,1500220177.243876,Ruben,...probably 20 years into the future.... but remember 2000!  Nobody saw _that_ coming.
253,1500220190.244797,Vonnie,"<@Ruben> for the moment, I just need to finish this "
253,1500220209.246264,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> Stick with what you have then ;-) But make a mental note to upgrade, 10 years from now."
253,1500220221.247183,Vonnie,I will upgrade 2 months from now :)
253,1500220228.247765,Ruben,That's great
253,1500220229.247866,Vonnie,Will try the code 
253,1500220318.254361,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> Also, your file should be named *BhagNawazBhag_stream.txt* instead of *stream_BhagNawazBhag.json*, because it is really not a JSON file. It is a text file with a JSON packet on every line. The program which produces this, will cause confusion by naming it with a '.json' extension."
253,1500220374.258377,Vonnie,Ohhh; I wish i had joined this group earlier ; Had spent countless hours looking for a solution 
253,1500220496.268215,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> And this is the code with mattrasband's suggestions applied:
```
from __future__ import print_function
import json

nr = 0
with open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json"") as f:
    for line in f:
        ob = json.loads(line)
        text = ob.get(""text"", """")
        user = ob.get(""user"")
        if user:
            username = user.get(""name"", """")
        print(username)
        print(text.encode(""utf8""))
        print()

        if nr &gt; 10:
            break
        else:
            nr += 1
```"
253,1500220538.271627,Vonnie,let me try it out. Thank you for that. I really appreciate the help.
253,1500220646.280426,Ruben,"I agree that the *from future* is quite useful for all of the people who use Python 3 already, but I'm less convinced of the *with open() as f* context manager. I think the file object will be closed anyway when it goes out of scope; the context manager seems to add extra complexity and an extra indentation level. However I _do_ think a file context is useful when writing a file as part of a larger operation, so you can indeed force it to close (and flush to disk)."
253,1500220707.285176,Vonnie,"I did try python 3 earlier but a lot of the scripts/recipes were written in 2.7, so I had to downgrade"
253,1500220718.28602,Ruben,"Uh-uh. I see.; Well, it's not forbidden to use Python 2 ;-); I used it for 25 years and I'm still using it."
253,1500220796.292729,Vonnie,i understand :slightly_smiling_face: Apologies for being a bit slow here; the script worked
253,1500220811.295135,Ruben,Great! And now?
253,1500220864.300484,Vonnie,i can run that in the command prompt and save the output.; would i be able to edit the code and add some more to it? as in to get other data from it?
253,1500220888.302644,Ruben,What is your ultimate goal? To extract the tweets from the file?; Oh yeah sure you could extract anything and everything from it
253,1500220966.309263,Vonnie,"Basically I just need to make the file easier to read so I can count the number of tweets, retweets, see who tweets the most, and do a word cloud."
253,1500221027.314477,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> Ah, you want to do some statistics on the data."
253,1500221052.316806,Vonnie,Yup. That's what the plan is. I just need to get a better idea of what people are doing and saying
253,1500221061.317572,Ruben,"Well, counting the tweets is not hard: that's just the number of tweet objects in your stream file."
253,1500221075.31858,Vonnie,yeah i mean that was just the easiest part :slightly_smiling_face:; there was another script which had the functions i needed but it gave me the same error
253,1500221130.323019,Ruben,"Counting the number of retweets is somewhat harder, is that mentioned in the Tweet object? If so, you could fetch it and do something with it. Retweets always belong to one specific tweet, no?"
253,1500221181.327013,Vonnie,well i could skip that. just would prefer to see who the most prolific ones are
253,1500221220.329913,Ruben,"You mean, you are only interested in tweets that get a lot of retweets?"
253,1500221270.334036,Vonnie,"well i am analysing twitter trends. have four big files. want to see who tweets the most, which ones got the most RTs, geotag them, and make a word cloud."
253,1500221301.336394,Ruben,"Why do you have 4 big files, and not 2 or 6 or 35?"
253,1500221323.338036,Vonnie,the script i followed didn't give me the option to make smaller ones; so basically i collected a lot of tweets for trends; the four files are for four trends
253,1500221357.340572,Ruben,"Ah, every trend gets its own stream file!"
253,1500221366.34125,Vonnie,yes; and those files are around 1 gb to 1.5 gb each
253,1500221499.352031,Ruben,"*who tweets the most* -&gt; Every tweet has a 'user' object, and in there is a 'name' attribute with the name of the user who made the tweet. You could use a dictionary to store all usernames and the tweet count. You know, going from the beginning to the end of the tweets and storing the username in a dict, or incrementing the tweet count if the user is already in the dict.; The when the counting is done, you could convert the dict to a list of (name, tweetcount) tuples and sort that on decreasing tweetcount. Then print out the first 10 items of the result and you have a TOP 10 of most prolific tweeters.; Or is it twitterers?; :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"
253,1500221579.358444,Vonnie,Either name works :)
253,1500221629.362256,Ruben,<@Vonnie> Dont worry about the file size because the construction 'for line in f: ...' doesn't load the entire file into memory.
253,1500221692.367146,Vonnie,Ahh; So no need to iterate ; Would I be too lazy if I asked someone here how I can do that? 
253,1500221980.390141,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> For example, to show the Twitter users with the most tweets:
```
import json
import collections

twitterers = collections.defaultdict(int)

with open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json"") as f:
    for line in f:
        ob = json.loads(line)
        # text = ob.get(""text"", """")
        user = ob.get(""user"")
        if user:
            username = user.get(""name"", """")
        if username:
            twitterers[username] += 1

print ""Most prolific twitterers (or tweeters? Twitter users?)""

for k, v in sorted(twitterers.iteritems(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg.encode(""utf8"")
    if v &lt; 6:

```"
253,1500222009.392897,Vonnie,Wow; That's really good ; I need to sit down and work on my python skills after September 
253,1500222113.401196,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> Yeah it really pays to know the data structures and the common idioms.; I am sure my code can be made even better.; Do you see a bug there? `not interested in people with less than 6 tweets` still, I see a line which says `PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets`. How do you think that could be prevented?"
253,1500222286.414835,Vonnie,Maybe not include RTs ; It probably has included RTs 
253,1500222310.416952,Ruben,"No, I don't do anything with retweets in the code above."
253,1500222399.423867,Vonnie,Maybe I can let that slide ; Will just truncate the rest 
253,1500222500.431863,Ruben,"The solution is to test _before_ outputting something, like:
```
for k, v in sorted(...):
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)

instead of:

253,1500222528.434008,Vonnie,Ahh
253,1500222622.442254,Ruben,You know what the `break` statement does?
253,1500222662.445777,Vonnie,Terminate 
253,1500222874.463768,Ruben,Terminate what? The whole program?
253,1500222913.466829,Vonnie,Inside the loop 
253,1500222943.469266,Ruben,Correct! The break terminates the loop in which it is placed
253,1500223025.47596,Vonnie,Glad I remember some of my stuff ; Will try this out 
253,1500223375.504427,Ruben,Another nice question. What's the difference between a *class* and an *instance* ? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
253,1500223511.51563,Vonnie,A class consists of objects etc ; And an instance is an object 
253,1500223623.524486,Ruben,"I agree that an instance is an object, but not that a class 'consists of' objects.; Mjah not bad. A *class* is indeed a kind of definition which says what data exists and what methods (functions) there are to operate on it. However, having a *Person* class doesn't give you actual persons. You'd have to _instantiate_ some Person objects and give them names, ages, etc...; And in Python, as well as Swift, we can instantiate objects by calling the class as if it were a function. `fred = Person()` will instantiate an instance of the class Person and have `fred` reference it. In Javascript you have to use `new` to create a new instance of a class.; In Ruby too!"
253,1500224068.561081,Vonnie,Ahh
253,1500224091.562833,Ruben,So you like learning Python?
253,1500224120.565244,Vonnie,I found it more interesting than other languages ; Need to learn so I can be better ; I can analyse data ; Usually use r ; In this case need to use python 
253,1500224370.585509,Ruben,"Oh, I never tried 'R'. I was charmed by Python many years ago because of its great data structures and ease of manipulating them. Nowadays I'm also looking into JavaScript (it has become lots better lately) and Clojure and ClojureScript (LISP always fascinated me, so expressive and succinct!)."
253,1500224403.58825,Vonnie,That's why am using python here ; Easier to just get what I need.
253,1500224496.597587,Ruben,"The JavaScript community has even invented *coffeescript* which is a kind of JavaScript but without all the brackets and syntax burden! It uses indentation for blocks of code, just like Python does. Same goes for CSS languages like Less and Sass, and template languages like Jade and Pug."
253,1500224518.599423,Vonnie,"Need to research it ; As u mentioned earlier, it wasn't really a json file ; Just wanted it to be readable so I can analyse it properly "
253,1500224611.60761,Ruben,"I agree that it should be text-only (not binary!) so you can inspect it in an editor; But serialized JSON, everything on one line, is just as useful as XML ;-)"
253,1500224639.609843,Vonnie,Haha 
253,1500224655.611218,Ruben,I use *pprint.pprint(obj)* to print out objects nicely
253,1500224658.611453,Vonnie,Here's the thing. I am working on a paper for my dissertation ; My supervisor said that I won't be judged for code ; Just the analysis as it's about  social media ; So that's why I know it's not unethical to ask 
253,1500224734.617722,Ruben,"I helped some PhD's in the past, (for free), maybe I can help you too?"
253,1500224770.620611,Vonnie,I would appreciate it. Lost a lot of time as my father was ailing from cancer and lost his battle a month ago 
253,1500224811.62381,Ruben,I'm so sorry to hear that. It happened to my grandparents.; <@Vonnie> Another PhD I helped was about <https://github.com/motoom/farasabina>
253,1500224840.626206,Vonnie,Sorry to hear that 
253,1500224907.631685,Ruben,"I could help you with the hard programming parts of the data analysis of your dissertation, and the only compensation I ask for is that I can open-source the software on GitHub as a showcase.; Would you be fine with that?"
253,1500224948.634822,Vonnie,That would be great. I would appreciate it ; Code being open source helps ; Would it be OK after I get my grade?
253,1500225020.640693,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> My email is <mailto:motoom@xs4all.nl|motoom@xs4all.nl> - and I'm glad you agree with me that Open Source is great. It's all for the advancement of Science, no? It is so important that peer reviewers can inspect every step in the scientific process."
253,1500225034.641844,Vonnie,Indeed ; Learning should be for everyone 
253,1500225051.643184,Ruben,Open-sourcing your data and methodogies fit in that pattern.
253,1500225077.645369,Vonnie,Yes will help others 
253,1500225141.65023,Ruben,"Now, Science and Art... I've also done Art projects (for free!) like <https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords> for which I did all the programming"

253,1500225658.690507,Vonnie,Yeah that's what makes me laugh ; My main aim was to understand troll like behaviour ; My supervisor said it was too ambitious and I needed to stick with something on a smaller scale 
253,1500225759.698001,Ruben,But how would you detect 'troll behaviour'?
253,1500225792.700608,Vonnie,Yeah that's why he said it was too ambitious :)
253,1500225815.702269,Ruben,But do you have an idea what makes a 'twitter troll'?
253,1500225816.702378,Vonnie,So I suggested I crawl four trends ; A person who harasses others and is vile. ; So I crawled them 
253,1500225868.706356,Ruben,"I agree, but how do you deduce that from the text of the tweets? You looking for certain troll-words?"
253,1500225878.707126,Vonnie,Yes and that's why I want to do a word cloud ; Here's what I did 
253,1500225884.707547,Ruben,"Ah, I see."
253,1500225888.707817,Vonnie,I knew which trends to follow ; Two of them in favour of the govt ; They are a bunch of paid trolls ; Other trends were full of hatred ; My hypothesis is that the same people are taking part in those trends 
253,1500226030.718987,Ruben,"Interesting! You begin with a hypothesis, and do work to prove of disprove it. That's the scientific method, isn't it?; ...and are you also capable of making predictions after analysis of all teh data?; Like, what people are likely to be trolls? What behaviour is indicative of trolls?"
253,1500226153.728117,Vonnie,"Yes that's the idea ; Well that's why I am going for something simpler ; To detect patterns ; If I have time I can do a sentiment analysis but that would be overkill ; As I am balancing exam preparation and work on the project. Had to defer it because I had to be there to take care of my father ; Ps before they complain, I would move this discussion to private. Too many lines of text here "
253,1500226299.739804,Ruben,That is OK. How do we do that?
253,1500226327.741824,Vonnie,Well maybe communicate via dm here?; Alternatively email is also good

257,1500283042.278818,Suellen,"and why do you need context while looking at the URL?; `?`, `=` and `&amp;` have almost no place in 2017"
257,1500283094.296917,Meg,oh bull; they absolutely do
257,1500283120.305825,Suellen,"As a user, it's more confusing to see `?`, `=` and `&amp;`, then just `/`; why do my URLs have to look like that?"
257,1500283137.312022,Meg,"so, I fail to see how the first makes more sense; location with two numbers in slashes; what are those numbers?"
257,1500283162.320835,Suellen,Let's see how FB does it: `<https://www.facebook.com/notes/equine-calculator/how-to-claim-your-vanity-url-for-your-facebook-page/474147772600069/>`; `<https://www.facebook.com/help/121237621291199>`; Not `<http://facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376|facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376>...`
257,1500283206.336337,Meg,doesnt apply here exactly; because `/help` is just one resource that takes in one parameter; `/report/number/number` is pretty crappy design
257,1500283240.347867,Suellen,"no, that's way too technical of an explanation"
257,1500283255.352998,Meg,doesn't tell me anything abut what `report` is to take; <http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#advanced-queries>
257,1500283294.3659,Suellen,once you visit literally one report page you'll know exactly how to use it
257,1500283333.378966,Meg,and then looking through a list of URL endpoints; where `report` can have multiple filters
257,1500283399.401724,Suellen,&gt; An API is the user interface for a developer; you kinda forgot about the users here; doing things by the book will only make other developers pat you on the back
257,1500283442.416803,Meg,so?; `/reports` is a good identifier; leaving everything else after that in slashes is crappy design; especially when the purpose is to _filter_
257,1500283522.444359,Suellen,so what happens if a person DOES implement it that way?; what's the penalty for crappy design
257,1500283548.453236,Meg,give someone else the project
257,1500283552.454846,Suellen,developers are angry and users are a tiny bit less confused %)
257,1500283554.455206,Meg,with crappy URL structure; then you get a high WTF count and swear plenty at the idiot who came up with the URLs :slightly_smiling_face:
257,1500283594.469284,Suellen,but no complaints from users?
257,1500283601.471548,Meg,users don't give a shit
257,1500283610.47468,Suellen,I could theoretically recite this URL to my mum over the phone; the one with `?stuff=thing&amp;other=dunno`? not so much
257,1500283713.510501,Meg,"thing about this, you can do what you want; there's just convention, not hard rules; your method to me, is confusing; as a developer and a user; because all it does is tell me this is a report link; with some numbers; nothing about _what_ those numbers are and do"
257,1500283796.539302,Suellen,"you are trying to know what an URL is before visiting it; just open the page and it will be clear as day, you'll never forget those two numbers"
257,1500283872.566242,Meg,never forget two eight digit numbers?  got photographic memory? :slightly_smiling_face:; so your argument is that its easier to describe over the phone; where theres no copying and pasting involved; and that you're willing to accept the consequences of developer confusion and bad practices for that
257,1500284342.727902,Gabriele,"Just to add my $0.02; I also prefer the explicit lat/lng arguments, and dislike having things in the main URI path if they don't follow some sort of hierarchy; It does make the URIs a bit uglier but I don't think that matters in this context"
258,1500279701.13749,Coretta,"hi I have a doubt what is the difference between json.loads(b’byte_string_from_outside’) and b’byte_string_from_outside’.decode(‘utf-8’) because I read docs and experiment a little bit but is confusing because but seem to work, which one should  go ?"
258,1500279854.187058,Carri,The former will return a `dict` representation of the JSON. The latter just returns a `str`.
258,1500280055.253412,Luana,"in the first case may be returned any type that can be represented in json, not only dict; ```

260,1500297666.179251,Meg,"yeah, good idea; ""is there anything already done for this?"" is a good question to ask; saves _a lot_ of work"
261,1500292562.175639,Patty,"+1 on using query parameters. in addition to what was mentioned, doing `/lat/lon` also makes it more confusing as it makes it appear to be a parent/child relationship almost. the other form makes for sense for say, a user photo, where you end up with `/user/123456/photos/1241241`"
262,1500295855.338133,Thomasina,"Thank you all for the input! I really appreciate it. I will be implementing lat/long as query params. On a side note, with SQLAlchemy, what would be the best data type for storing a lat or long? I was going to use a float but I'm not sure if that's overkill.; <@Meg> Oh, I was weighing the pros and cons of float vs. decimal. With `asdecimal=True` does this mean I'm using a decimal, or is this some kind of float/decimal hybrid?; Ah, ok, I got it. Thanks!! Is your recommendation of decimal due to its accuracy?; <@Gabriele> Oh wow! I was doing all the geo stuff from scratch, not realizing there could be something like PostGIS! I was still figuring out an efficient method for finding records with locations within a certain distance of a specific lat/long, but I guess PostGIS can already do that.; <@Ciera> Yep, not sure why it didn't even occur to me. I gotta make that my motto. :joy:"
262,1500300648.843957,Willena,"<@Thomasina> you should also consider limiting the precision of your lat/lng coordinates to something like `decimal(9, 6)`.  More precision than that often leads to misrepresented accuracy.  6 decimal places is accurate to about 4 inches..."

263,1500315283.65991,Kandis,why cant i  get the absolute value of the number i input based on this code?

264,1500316849.561837,Thomasina,I've seen plenty of tacos in various commercials and whatnot and to be frank they do look appetizing.

264,1500317116.713754,Thomasina,Imagining having a taco outdoors after a nice bike ride...ah now I'm hungry!
264,1500317177.749427,Patty,<@Coretta> what is slow about it?; and what are you trying to get to in terms of speed?; rabbitmq is already very fast
264,1500317290.813186,Coretta,<@Patty> something between the answer and the response I’m getting above 2 second time; so yeah Im wonder what Im doing wrong; :disappointed:
264,1500317400.875403,Patty,Is this specifically with the part of the tutorial?
264,1500317468.914497,Coretta,I use the same code of the tutorial just change the finnocci funtion for a bot; that i have; I only want liitle tips like what is faster no_ack=True or no_ack=False; how to config the options
264,1500317535.952162,Patty,"it’s faster without acking, and with prefetching generally"
264,1500317685.039,Luana,I’d recommend to choose no_ack not by speed but by your use case
264,1500317714.055279,Patty,also is the function on the bot is running taking that long time? or is that from after the function is completely to sending back to the response? that should only be milliseconds
264,1500318167.316882,Kandis,the specific ‘i’ i wanna get in that range
264,1500318227.34906,Beula,"you can return from within the `for` if you want, no reason to keep iterating (otherwise you will *always* get the last `i` value)"
264,1500318409.447753,Kandis,but the problem of my code is not this; i couldnt get output with the code i pasted; oh i got 24 but its the wrong answer.; it should be 6; after i changed the thing i return to this:; then it worked and got 6; <@Shelly>
264,1500318592.542038,Beula,"because in Python variables are scoped for the function in this case. So `i` keeps getting re-assigned as it loops over the `range`; If you want to use the `i` without an intermediate variable, either return the `i` directly (as I demonstrated), or use the `break` statement"
264,1500318978.739968,Kandis,<@Beula>  what is the code look like when you return the i directly
264,1500318997.749064,Beula,Basically drop in my code snippet!; Those should be equivalent
264,1500319129.816024,Kandis,"i appreciate it but they dont work; i got this:; if x % i == 0 and y % i == 0:

264,1500319214.859664,Thomasina,"Oh sorry, just caught that"
264,1500319220.86259,Beula,"Looks like what you posed used tabs <@Kandis>  - the python standard is to use 4 spaces instead; So my stuff is configured different, if you re-do the indentation to match that visually, you will be good"
264,1500319238.871851,Kandis,yea i copied and pasted; oh
264,1500319243.874507,Meg,"if you're using ipython, just do `%paste`"
264,1500319254.880481,Thomasina,Is it the standard? :open_mouth: I've been using tabs from day 1.

264,1500319371.940745,Thomasina,"Oh, shoot! My bad. Although I'm curious why spaces are the standard. I think it seems so much easier to press tab once for every indent than space four times for every indent."
264,1500319382.946266,Kandis,omg i still get this: IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level; my 4 spaces is the same as 1 tab

264,1500319416.963835,Kandis,ah yes; well idk i tried both spaces and tabs
264,1500319445.978976,Beula,<@Thomasina> - you should make your editor insert 4 spaces when the tab key is hit. You don't literally type `&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;...`

264,1500320150.342958,Levi,"forgive me if I am wrong, but if you are looking for highest shouldn't you set your loop down the integers, rather than loop up?"
264,1500320191.363558,Beula,"Oh, maybe that is what I missed in the original intention - I thought it was the LCF"
264,1500320199.367982,Levi,"yes, they ask for HCF, not LCF; this is what I always told my students: read the question carefully - at least half of wrong answers are because the question was not properly parsed"
264,1500320308.423369,Kandis,6 is indeed the highest no?
264,1500320326.432412,Beula,"Sorry <@Kandis> - my bad; Yes, <@Levi> is right - it's best to walk DOWN instead of up this one"

264,1500320380.460344,Kandis,yea the standard answer i saw is:; it indeed gets the right answer for num1 and num2's HCF which is 6
264,1500320452.49694,Levi,"I think that this loop will work, but it might be suboptimal for large numbers.; but that is a topic for discussion; because you have no way of softcoding a break point in the if-then clause. Whereas if you start high you can jump out as soon as the clause is fulfilled"
264,1500320590.565724,Kandis,may i ask how did you determine when to loop up or down
264,1500320602.571943,Levi,"it just ""made sense"""
264,1500320626.584473,Beula,"If you want it a little more terse, combining what I had earlier and what you have:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):

        if x % 1 == 0 and y % i == 0:
            hcf = i

But this can be simplified even more going backwards instead of brute forcing it:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):
    smaller = min(x, y)

264,1500320698.620693,Levi,simplification means reducing the time complexity. Because those two snippets contain basically identical code structures.

264,1500320765.654576,Levi,"it is always `O(n)` in version one, where v. 2 is `O(n)` in the worst case"
264,1500320768.655903,Beula,"But for v2 the complexity could be at the best case `O(1)` (for any size of the range, only 1 operation is needed) and at the worst case `O(n)`"

264,1500321051.799523,Levi,<@Kandis> I think the best way to do these things is to experiment. You get intuition that way.

264,1500321187.870438,Levi,"it's a bit like math: a technical skill rather than a pure talent. That is, until you get to the higher levels. But looping limits, aligning indices, all that painful stuff has to be done a few dozen times before you stop thinking about it."
264,1500321278.917861,Cleta,<@Kandis> You should also checkout Asymptotic Notations and complexity.
264,1500321299.928869,Levi,great point. This is a fundamental theme in programming

270,1500324498.606636,Fleta,"hi, all! I have dict with oldstring as key and newstring as value. I need replace strings in file according to that dict. What is the best way to do that?"
270,1500324535.6262,Beula,What have you tried <@Fleta> ?
270,1500324918.82486,Fleta,"<@Beula> Well, I think to do it like this:
```
for key, value in dict.items():
    with open(filename, 'r+'):
        for line in f:
            line = re.sub(key,value, line)

     f.close()
```"
270,1500325000.867492,Beula,Does that work?; you could probably simplify it a little for yourself if you can fit the whole file in memory and then re-write it
270,1500325222.984296,Fleta,I thought there is more simple way...
270,1500325226.986654,Patty,"Also, if you use `with open` it handles closing the file for you. For those newer pythonistas, these are called context managers and are awesome"
270,1500325254.001525,Fleta,<@Patty> cool)
270,1500325347.050835,Beula,"Yeah, the simplest:

```
with open(my_file) as f:
    content = f.read()

for k, v in dict.items():
    content = re.sub(k, v, content)

with open(my_file, 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

Though there probably is a ""better"" way."
270,1500325749.247659,Fleta,"<@Beula> oh! that's really simple) thanks a lot, forget that it's possible to replace in the whole text not just in line"
270,1500325783.263228,Beula,"It saves a few iterations, but it will load the whole file in - so be aware of how large the file is!"
270,1500325903.319264,Fleta,"Oh, it's just hundreds of lines, it will be ok."

271,1500329332.766985,Johana,so has anyone tried to setup travis with a public python repository that has a private repository as a dependency? From what I can tell I need to have a private travis accnt to even do this =(.
271,1500329388.786598,Ciera,well it make sense
271,1500329429.801278,Johana,this wouldn’t be an issue except that my org has run out of private repos.; i think if i used a dependency link in my setup.py with the env_var of a user token that has access and format the dependency link url with the token it should be able to pull the dependency down.; a lil hacky.
271,1500329638.873366,Ciera,well if the repo is public people would have access; not sure if that's ok for you
271,1500329660.880881,Johana,not with the env var
271,1500329723.902114,Ciera,oh sorry I miss env var; yeah it could work
271,1500329757.913907,Johana,"yea, i’ll have to create a new user and give them read access but it sounds feasible. something for the morning!; ok, i found a good resource. i think this will do the trick. <https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth>; <@Beula> travis isn’t letting me put in an ssh key.; it shows me where i can in the docs but it looks like that’s the spot for a travis pro account."
271,1500331187.36665,Beula,"Oh yeah I'm thinking of your hack, make it an envvar, echo it to a file and then clone ; Travis is pricey"
271,1500331202.3714,Johana,oh ok.
271,1500331234.381222,Beula,Maybe make a basic auth user and use https ; Then in the before process stripe in the creds

274,1500338172.130497,Kiersten,"Hmmm... I have a list of dictionaries that I need to merge but sum one of the keys. Need some direction. My Monday brain is not working efficiently.
Something like this
```
# start with

    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3},

]
```"
274,1500339003.298264,Beula,<@Kiersten> - is the merge based on the `id` field (or a grouping of the values)? Also does order matter?
274,1500339215.340314,Kiersten,"order does not matter, i just need to sum the ""val"", every other piece of data is the same, the id will always be the same; so yes, on the `id` field; With my real data, I am merging on a unique string code"
274,1500339597.419776,Beula,"I would probably use a dict if the dataset is small enough:

```
cache = {}

        cache[item['id']] = item
    else:
        cache[item['id']]['val'] += item['val']

277,1500392067.608399,Johana,not sure this will work but if you used a jupyter notebook they would have something essentially like a gui. they could run your code and get ouput and it be relatively easy.

277,1500392118.642422,Myong,"Haha, well they already get insights. It just gets tedious for the guys to hand type in all the updated info for each week for the last 12 weeks; and it has to be redone each time cause each week the analytics change of course for the weeks before also so they can spend an hour updating the thing; When python can do it in a few seconds :slightly_smiling_face:"

277,1500392360.800799,In,plus it can be put on github and look cool
277,1500392377.811763,Myong,Sort of like a prelim thing I can show them when I'm done and they can decide if they want a GUI or not
277,1500392409.832985,Johana,you might have to setup your own jupyterhub server but it is relatively easy to do. the jupyterhub server can be setup to require username and password.; then no one needs to install anything.; they simply go to your page: <http://jupyter.kbman.com|jupyter.kbman.com> and login; i have an ansible playbook if needed :wink:; more info here: <https://jupyter.org/>
277,1500392592.953028,Myong,Once I get this setup I'll definitely get that setup
277,1500392608.963634,In,"if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file"
277,1500392771.071652,Johana,"since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.; the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.; so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that."
277,1500393726.703134,Myong,That might actually be super convenient; Oh man this should be fun. The documentation for this API is leading me to 404 errors.
278,1500397073.705173,Beula,TIL ipython does input; <@Johana> can you show live terminal output in there?
278,1500397101.72168,Johana,what do you mean live?
278,1500397111.727827,Beula,Say I run a long-running subprocess
278,1500397132.740515,Johana,hmmm… idk. i would have to try it. you can run pip commands and they scroll out. that’s what is happening at the top.
278,1500397135.742371,Beula,"Or can you only spawn one and print the data; Oh, I guess I didn't think about how they have the syntax to run straight shell commands; <@Johana> :taco:; I totally spaced the `!shell command`"

278,1500399318.021327,Liliana,"so i'm working on a small web app that will allow users to search instagram for two hashtags at the same time.  

the route of the app the user is given this form 

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Enter two comma separated tags (no hashtag symbol!!!)&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

Which is processed by this route

```
@app.route('/results/', methods=['GET', 'POST'], defaults={'token': None})
@app.route('/results/&lt;token&gt;', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def results(token):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        tags = request.form['text'].replace(' ', '').split(',')
        data = fetch_data(tags=tags, next_page_token=token)
        processed_data, token = process_data(data=data, tags=tags)

    if request.method == 'GET':
        <http://logging.info|logging.info>('REQUEST ARGS: {}'.format(request.args))

    return render_template('results.html', data=processed_data[:1], token=token)

and the results are displayed via this template

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body style=""background-color:powderblue;""&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;{{ data }}&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""More results plz"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

my issue is that i'm trying to pass the next page token to the results page through the URL, so that when the user push the button for more results, ti gets sent back to the `/results` route.  right now when i load the ""more results"" i get a `500` error and it doesn't look like the token is being passed in the url properly because it is before the question mark

```

278,1500399796.298089,Gabriele,"What does the HTML of the page look like? That `{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}` bit should be expanded out, so you can verify what it's passing in; Oh, wait, the token does come through - I had to scroll down to see your Log line. But it's not in 'args', perhaps, and that's okay"
278,1500399867.340277,Liliana,hm; kk
278,1500399907.363882,Gabriele,"Also, if you get a 500 error, normally that would give you a traceback, no? So you could see exactly where it breaks"
278,1500400036.439586,Liliana,"ah, so it is coming though as the variable token, but it's not something i can parse from the url because it's not an actual arg; is there a better way to pass data from page to page? maybe with query params?"
278,1500400102.478011,Gabriele,"Maybe, but I don't see how that's relevant here - if you are getting 'token' correctly, it implies the problem is in your `fetch_data` call and how you pass token in is working"
278,1500400154.508418,Myong,Working with .csv/excel stuff should I be using just the `csv` module or `pandas/openpyxl`

I know thought that I can convert the python 2 to 3 and find some hacky ways how to do it still but I wonder if it's worth the effort. Maybe there are some better ways I can do with python 3.

283,1500407109.502072,Levi,<@Sharlene> that is a cool project idea; Yahoo finance is the best *free* source of financial data out there. Google isn't as good given the constraints they place on how much data you can pull from their servers

285,1500422092.687331,Alvin,"<@Thomasina> I see.  Do you have a py script anywhere where you imports ""backend"" first?; <@Thomasina> To asnwer your question: Yes.  It's hard to guess without the full code but pay close attention to __init__.py and your initial app import.  The folder structure needs to be what Flask expects or at least direct it to it if you're going the unconventional way.; <@Thomasina> Once you need to deploy this to a server, you ll need a wsgi script that would declare all the pathes as well. Otherwise you'll be banging your head trying to figure out why an ""moduleName importError"" is popping everywhere."

285,1500423724.090845,Thomasina,<@Alvin> in `__init__.py` is the snippet :slightly_smiling_face:

288,1500440321.212122,Katheryn,What is the strategy to decide limit for number of processes when working with `multiprocessing`?
288,1500440365.219875,Beula,"I'd favor `concurrent.futures` (or the `futures` backport if you are on python2).; Basically you can define a pool with the max workers; ```
import concurrent.futures

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as pool:
    pool.submit(print, 'Hello World')
```; (untested and from memory <@Katheryn> :point_up::skin-tone-4:)"
288,1500440476.240428,Katheryn,"Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I’ll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?"
288,1500440528.249425,Beula,"Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive; Especially resource sharing"

Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
293,1500474283.78258,Gabriele,How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?; I didn't think Heroku had a local option

293,1500474870.17666,Thomasina,Ya I have no idea. I just want to get PostGIS running on Heroku. But I guess I'll need Postgres anyway if I intend to test my app locally. Currently I just plug it into an SQLite DB to test it.

293,1500475367.504552,Thomasina,"I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well."
293,1500475440.553419,Gabriele,That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.; If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
293,1500475531.614085,Thomasina,That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...
293,1500483648.840446,Suellen,<@Gabriele> what; &gt; That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.; SQLite's Full-text search was blazing fast before Postgres had a reasonable FTS at all.

301,1500523111.551238,Katheryn,"Hello, a design question for a slackbot. I’m using slack’s RTM APIs to establish a websocket connection with slack. Code is deployed on a single instance/machine and everything is working well. Now, I want one more production instance to ensure availability in case one is down. How can I replicate the deployment on two machines?"
301,1500523219.571001,Beula,You really can't with a slackbot <@Katheryn> - otherwise what would happen is you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. You may need a fail-over instead where another machine starts up and starts the bot if the main machine fails (of course you would likely have a period of downtime during that failover)
301,1500523272.580523,Katheryn,"&gt; you’d have two bots listening and responding to all events.
Yeah, that was the problem even I had in mind. Should I explore on message queues?"
301,1500523390.602122,Beula,"I guess you could, I haven't checked for any that de-duplicate repeat messages though"
301,1500523637.644338,Katheryn,"I have never worked with message queues before. Can we have a configuration where event is consumed only by _one_ consumer at a time? Or, is it replicated to all of them?; But all this sounds too complicated, I think. We only have about 800 users using out bot"
301,1500523767.666992,Beula,"I am not aware of a way to only have one consumer listening at a time, but you could use a distributed lock for who is the ""active"" listener - but those are somewhat complicated.; consul has a mechanism to do this"
301,1500523905.689274,Marcie,i'd just keep all the state in a database; messaging queues and consul in this would make things overly complicated in what's basically a feed consumption mechanism
301,1500523999.704726,Katheryn,"&gt; `i'd just keep all the state in a database`
Could you please elaborate more on this?"
301,1500524463.78089,Marcie,"<@Katheryn> you have two services:
  service a: talks to Slack RTM, receives messages and puts them in incoming database, reads outgoing database, sends event to slack
  service b: consumes messages from incoming database, does logic to generate response, puts outgoing message onto database"
301,1500524571.798452,Beula,"That doesn't really solve the issue of service a going down though, which is the desire, from my understanding; e.g. HA consumer"
301,1500524603.803873,Marcie,service b can run as many instances as you'd like; and you could run multiple service a as well if you wanted; you'd just have a constraint on message ID uniqueness in the DB
301,1500524723.823681,Katheryn,"so, basically, we are using database as an alternative to a message queue here?"
301,1500524762.830032,Beula,<@Katheryn> the difference with a DB is the unique constraint if you get message IDs; so you could have any number of consumers from the RTM api
301,1500524779.833157,Marcie,alternative isn't quite the right phrase i think
301,1500524785.834128,Katheryn,I see
301,1500524812.83858,Beula,"But depending on your load, you may get some DB locking issues. With 800 users, you are probably OK; even our chat at its busiest wouldn't cause any trouble (that I can think of)"
301,1500524840.84329,Marcie,message queues are really good for service discovery but not as good for reliable storage
301,1500524932.857968,Beula,"If you wanted the distributed systems approach for load:

1. N consumers -&gt; Rabbitmq Excahnge
2. RabbitMQ Exchange to any bound queues
  *  One queue subscribed for saving to a DB
  * Another for processing

You can do different routing mechanisms so the same work goes to the same worker, but instead just allow dupes and test for dupes on the consumer side; But that's way overly complicated for the current need, it sounds"
301,1500525153.894629,Katheryn,"Yes, I would agree. I am more inclined towards <@Marcie> suggestion.
One more question, I am using `crontab` as a kind of “automated restart” setup for my bot’s running service and other scheduled events. Few days ago, there was a problem with `crontab`. Not sure about the cause. Any suggestions on improving this setup? Alternatives to `crontab`?; Can we have notifications setup to know if `cron` didn’t run?"
301,1500525233.908366,Beula,"Are you polling for it to be up or something?; A `systemd` service would be better, IMO"
301,1500525333.924905,Katheryn,"Well, I’m using `cron` to poll and monitor for my bot’s running process. So, to poll cron, we need another monitor?"
301,1500525347.927229,Beula,"No, systemd would replace that need"
301,1500525363.929826,Collette,RabbitMQ with HA queues and publisher confirms is a pretty good reliable storage for temporary data
301,1500525364.930032,Beula,"basically the OS has a construct to ensure a process is always running at a certain ""runlevel""; Look into `systemctl` or `systemd` <@Katheryn>; they should be synonymous"

By `statement 2` I think it's actually referring to `ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)`. This is a valid lat/long though and looking at the documentation it appears `ST_MakePoint` does in fact accept a lat/long. :thinking_face:; <@Meg> Oh, not sure why census data never occurred to me. Nice!"

304,1500551601.476776,Meg,and regarding your query; what is `geom`
304,1500551636.487739,Gabriele,To get all locations within a radius of somewhere is exactly the right sort of problem for PostGIS
304,1500551642.489495,Meg,yeah; because you're working with spatial data
304,1500551653.492812,Gabriele,The only simpler solution is to call someone else's API to perform the same operation on their database
304,1500551661.49551,Meg,and postgis is highly optimized; you could do a naive solution; but it would be significantly less performant
304,1500551680.501642,Thomasina,`geom` is a column containing geometry data (in this case it's the boundaries of towns in a small section of the US).

304,1500559563.216304,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> So I took a very large dataset of world cities in .csv and imported them into my database, then I added a `geog` column and used `UPDATE cities SET geog = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326);` which ran without errors. Did I perhaps miss something in that command?"
304,1500559619.250968,Kandis,how does one “executes this code”
304,1500559631.258664,Gabriele,"Probably not, but that's beyond my knowledge"
304,1500559632.259019,Thomasina,`python myscript.py`
304,1500559642.265561,Kandis,how does one “executes this script”***; oh!
304,1500559653.272836,Beula,<@Thomasina> :taco: 
304,1500559662.278264,Thomasina,vs. running `python myotherscript.py` - on a script containing `import myscript`; <@Beula> :fork_and_knife:
304,1500559732.32134,Gabriele,Although it looks like you're assigning geometry to a geography column... not sure if that's okay or not
304,1500559737.3245,Thomasina,"There aren't all that many times when I have enough knowledge to help around here, so I try to do it when I can.; Maybe I should have ran `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)::geography`?"
304,1500559842.389366,Winnifred,Nice!
304,1500559872.407518,Gabriele,ST_SetSRID returns geometry
304,1500560003.488094,Thomasina,Oh does it? I used the command because I think it was in a solution on StackOverflow...now I can't seem to find the page so maybe I just got mixed up. :joy:
304,1500560031.505696,Gabriele,Those commands look fine - but if you try to assign a geometry to a geography column I don't know what will happen
304,1500560086.539421,Thomasina,"I see... Well, I'm having a lot of difficulty finding a way of populating a geography column from lat/long coordinates :confused:"
304,1500560219.623296,Gabriele,you probably just want a geometry column
304,1500560222.625065,Thomasina,"Ok so I found the StackOverflow post. I see that it was recommended to run `ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(long, lat), 4326)::geography`. I omitted casting completely.; After reading it doesn't sound like geometry would be a good fit as my use case involves locations on a global scale; Unless I misunderstand the pros/cons which is certainly possible"
304,1500560331.693768,Gabriele,Usually it'll depend on what sort of distances are involved
304,1500560511.806482,Kandis,"i am still trying to figure it out lol; The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won’t run on import); this script here means this chuck of code?; chunk*; this code means:
import pandas as pd
def test_run():
    df=pd.read_csv(‘/Users/elaineyang/Desktop/Programming/AAPL.csv’)
    print(df); ?; and can i say, whenever i import something i have to have “if __name__==‘__main__‘:”; or else the imported code cant be run?; <@Thomasina>"
304,1500561010.129885,Beula,"So for example, I have this script:

```
# cat.py
class Cat:
    def say(self):
        print(""meow"")


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    Cat().say()
```

I can either call it directly: `python cat.py` and it will meow.

But say I have another module that wants to use this class:

```
from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass
```

I wouldn't want it to meow until I tell it to
"
304,1500561022.138388,Thomasina,"<@Kandis>
So everything...oh wait he beat me to it :joy:; <@Beula> :lightning: :runner:"
304,1500561074.172514,Kandis,lol
304,1500561095.18688,Beula,"The background on this is that `__name__` is a build in dunder (double underscore). It is set to the name of the module running - if the module is executed directly it's ""__main__"", otherwise I think it defaults to the file name (I don't recall ATM); Tldr you only need the if name/main if you want to be able to execute some code when the script is directly invoked"
304,1500561202.258095,Kandis,"so accordin to what you said, how do you let it say meow on the second code; from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass"
304,1500561373.3701,Beula,"That class inherited the meow method, so make an instance and call say on it!

Sorry, a class may have been a bad example"
304,1500561730.602973,Kandis,<@Beula> <@Thomasina> <@Winnifred> :taco: thanks so much!
304,1500561772.630326,Thomasina,<@Kandis> :knife_fork_plate: Thanks! I was actually pretty hungry.

304,1500561903.717338,Thomasina,"Oh, cool! Didn't notice the time zone. Actually I had a small breakfast but I woke up at 1AM, so I haven't eaten in 8 or 9 hours. :dizzy_face:"
304,1500561950.748483,Kandis,:fearful: hope your bed time is not usually like this lol it doesnt sound good
304,1500562058.819959,Thomasina,"Haha, I don't really have a bedtime. Sometimes I'm going to sleep at 10PM, other times 6AM, other times 2PM. It seems to change every day too. I can't hold a schedule. Today maybe I'll sleep around...I'm not even sure...8PM? I was a night owl but now I'm a cuckoo bird it seems. :joy:; <@Kandis> By the way, if you don't mind me asking, I'm just really curious; are you learning Python for school?"
304,1500562278.967535,Kandis,"haha! i learn it for my career :joy: i wanna be able to build a trading program and things like that; i am studying finance at school; python is kinda cool. i was thinking of learning SQL or R after it, but woah, python seems deep enough for me to learn quite a while <@Thomasina>"
304,1500562482.103732,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> Oh, niiiice! That's really cool. Yes, I'm not sure whether R would be all that helpful if you learn Python, although learning at least basic SQL could come in handy sometimes. I suppose you'll be doing a lot of data science in your field? Perhaps machine learning?; I've been doing web and software dev for a long time but started learning Python more recently as it was required for a project involving machine learning."
304,1500562564.15926,Kandis,"see. i found something online, here:; Banks use Python for pricing, risk management and trade management platforms. More recently, they’ve been reprogramming their trading systems to run off Python rather than other, clunkier languages."
304,1500562568.162048,Beula,I was a finance person <@Kandis> - started with python too :smile:
304,1500562632.205666,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Oh that's right! Then did you work with pandas, numpy, scikit or similar tech?; I'm not sure how long ML has played a big role in finances but would be interested in knowing."
304,1500562713.260175,Kandis,<@Beula> so cool. was python helpful to you during work?
304,1500562714.261269,Beula,"No, I was more in the retail side (to clients directly, vs in a bank) and at the time I didn't know how much was out there!; Yeah <@Kandis> , I wasn't doing a ton of high intensity stuff with it - but I was able to remove about 10-12hours of work/week by automating silly tasks"
304,1500562754.287294,Kandis,so cooooooool; were you in a retail bank you said?; what kind of bank; <@Beula>
304,1500562891.383008,Beula,"No, the retail side (not a bank). I was a financial advisor; and stock trader for clients"
304,1500563107.53023,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> I believe there's a ton of opportunity in this space, and it also allows you to branch in different directions should the economy change. Not only a lot of jobs but a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities as well. It's a smart choice."
304,1500563136.550271,Kandis,<@Beula> SO COOL what do you do now then; <@Thomasina> :+1::skin-tone-3:
304,1500564639.548937,Beula,That's a good idea! Do you ever use doctest too? It's excellent for simple functions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>
304,1500566372.693269,Kandis,plt.grid(True); what does this mean
304,1500566591.83804,Helene,I want to learn python . What is the best resource to refer for object oriented python ?
304,1500566653.878101,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> I'm not entirely sure what library `plt` is referring to but if I'm correct I think it simply enables the display on a grid in any charts you generate.; Oh ya, probably pltlib"
304,1500566680.895808,Beula,"<@Helene> Do you know any other programming languages, or are you just starting out?"
304,1500566791.96507,Meg,"<@Kandis> might mean the matplotlib library, since `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is common convention; and for future reference, when you ask these kind of questions (what does this variable do, etc), its best to add some more information; and in this case, if you had the code in front of you, you could search for instances of `plt` in the code; which would have brought you to the import statement, among others"
304,1500566896.029732,Kandis,yea i just didnt know the grid(True) part and kai_m answered me ;D
304,1500566906.035169,Helene,yup . I know basic programming .
304,1500566911.038331,Meg,understood
304,1500566928.048837,Helene,but my concepts of object oriented programming are not so cool .
305,1500550833.242022,Meg,"and furthermore, regarding docker

so, docker basically puts a bare bones VM in which you specify containers for parts of your application stack.; so, if you're on windows and another dev is on mac; you can ensure that whatever issues you have are code related and not OS related; furthermore, bringing in a new dev and getting them integrated with the projects is much simpler, because you already hhave the environment and code _right there_"
306,1500558997.852226,Thomasina,"So I've loaded a table with a list of world cities but I'm not getting the expected results. For example I can run `SELECT * FROM cities WHERE ST_DWithin(geog, ST_MakePoint(45.4215,75.6972)::geography, 470000)` which _should_ return Toronto and a number of other surrounding cities. I've confirmed that Toronto exists in the database with the expected lat/long. However 0 rows are returned. :disappointed:"
306,1500559229.002518,Gabriele,"<@Thomasina> Do you ever get any results? e.g. if you increase the distance to a very large number?; <@Thomasina> _""the source geometries must both be of the same coordinate projection""_... are you sure the data is all correct?"

I wouldn't suggest this for a larger project though, but for something simple or just to test in development it works."
308,1500568128.763606,Helene,can you suggest some good resources ?
308,1500568311.873261,Beula,Hoping others come along that are newer than I am with their resources they used :smile:
308,1500569149.360914,Helene,and can you share some advanced resources you use ?; May be something may help
308,1500569680.666871,Beula,"You can go through the python tutorial, otherwise I just look at stuff as they come up. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>

that worked :slightly_smiling_face:

311,1500636759.180965,Gabriele,sqlite is great; But I do think Python would be better if there was more effort spent on getting good packages into the standard library
311,1500636821.196982,Suellen,yeah.. maybe.. but it's not that easy; say you want a better datetime. what do you pick?; Arrow? Why not Delorean?
311,1500636872.211009,Gabriele,"That's not the sort of thing you need to answer immediately in a chat... you'd get a few knowledgeable people, they'd discuss it for a bit, find use cases, check code quality, etc"

311,1500636975.238709,Suellen,"But PyPI provides an illusion of a democracy, where you can chose whatever you want.; Python and PEPs isn't a democracy at all; so maybe it's a calculated decision -- to not introduce some things into stdlib"

315,1500646983.461371,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> I use it declutter my source code. Basically it is a `dict` like object where you don't have to type `[""` and `""]` all the time. So I can write:```; ```for r in bunched(recordset): # Where recordset is fetch_all() of DictCursor

315,1500647312.653471,Gabriele,"In the general case, yes. It's not exactly a great hardship. In a database context, it might be nice to have a type that directly reflects the DB schema - which is what we have ORM for"
315,1500647373.689487,Ruben,"btw, the `NamedTupleCursor` gets its attribute names from the fields behind the *SELECT*. I.e. `select name, salary from Employees` would result in *.name* and *.salary* attributes on the tuples in the resultset."
315,1500647425.720812,Gabriele,"I just really dislike things that attempt to cut down on a bit of typing by ruining the interface. Several parsers do it, like BeautifulSoup. lxml.objectify is even worse"
315,1500647494.762088,Ruben,I wouldn't call it ruining. It makes the code more readable to me. I prefer dot notation over index lookup with a string.
315,1500647587.816673,Gabriele,"The dot notation and the index lookup carry different information. `x.y` implies that `y` _must_ exist. `x[""y""]` implies that a value for ""y"" might exist, if someone added it earlier."

315,1500647682.873174,Ruben,"Ah, we have a different view on that too. When I see `x[""y""]` in code, I assume the programmer knows that an *y* value is present, or should be present (punishable by KeyError). When I see `x.get(y)`, then I know the programmer is trying to communicate to me that *y* perhaps does not exist in *x*."
315,1500647697.881984,Gabriele,"it's an object that contains an arbitrary number of other objects; <@Ruben>  But the point is that you see it's a dict, and that the contents vary; Obviously you can make assumptions if you know what's been added, but the syntax tells you the nature of the structure you're working with"
315,1500647779.931514,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> Yeah there you have a point, `x[""y""]` certainly conveys that *x* is a dict.; ...or at least a mapping type on which you can do indexed lookups.; Now wouldn't it be fun to override `__getitem__()` to call a memberfunction instead of looking up a value, and have `__call__()` lookup an indexed item?; You could write `a[""save""]` to call functions and `a(""age"")` to lookup values.; :joy:"

322,1500715752.971477,Thomasina,I'm trying to wrap my head around GeoAlchemy but I'm having a really hard time. I have a lat and lon column in my table...should I be using a geometry column instead?
322,1500715778.972867,Gabriele,yes
322,1500715859.977988,Thomasina,"Ok...but I'm not sure if I should be using geography or geometry...If I wanted to show points over the size of, say, the continental US, would that be a problem with geometry?"
322,1500715879.979154,Gabriele,"Are you showing points over that sort of area within a single query? And what are your accuracy requirements?; PostGIS is definitely awkward to work with, I'll give you that. And understanding the geom/geog stuff, and converting between them, is fiddly. But stick at it.; I have a geography column in my DB (specifically, `geography(Point,4326) NOT NULL`), and it works for me. I only need to find places near other places, and each place is represented with a point, so I don't have rigorous requirements on accuracy, or the need for it to be correct over long distances; So I could probably have been okay with a geometry object"
322,1500716248.001376,Thomasina,"The accuracy doesn't have to be particularly high at that distance, just good enough that if the user zooms in on that point on the map it doesn't drift so much that it appears to be flying across the map. Haha
Thank you for your encouragement! I am determined to figure it out. :slightly_smiling_face:
I suppose that the important part is showing points within a much smaller scale (say a few city blocks in each direction) within about 5 meters of accuracy. I'm just thinking though that even if the large scale stuff isn't important, why not use geography anyway?"
322,1500716305.004638,Gabriele,"Geography has fewer functions available on it, so you need to convert to geometry to perform various tasks; I mostly just compare distances, so geography is fine. The geography type basically exists to allow for accurate distance comparisons; But trying to perform complex perimeter or area calculations on the surface of a not-quite-sphere is complex, so for that sort of thing, I think that is where they require you to project to geometry and suck up some error"
322,1500717089.050327,Thomasina,"Ah I see. Makes sense. The only thing that's important is that I'm able to get everything within a box (which will be the area the user is viewing in the app). Distance between points, perimeters, and areas, aren't important"
322,1500717462.072149,Gabriele,"Sounds like you want the ST_Contains test. It operates on geometry. Make a polygon of your box, test it against the points.; There's also ST_Covers for geography, but it appears less used."
323,1500709937.637778,Suellen,"`map` returns an iterator (lazily); i.e. if you have a million objects and apply a function with `map`, the `map object` will be returned right away and the actual result of a function will be applied when you iterate over the values; `my_list3 = list(map(lambda n: n*n, nums))` is one way to ""fix"" this"

328,1500756240.077574,Suellen,"`sed -r` is an extended mode, so that `+` is enabled (matches one or more characters, unlike `*` that matches zero or more); `s///g` or `s|||g` or any symbol instead of `|` is how a basic replacing expression is constructed.
The first field is what to match, the second is what to replace it with.; `(.+)/[^/]+/([^/]+)/.+`
`(.+)/` matches anything from the start until the first `/` and puts found characters in the first group (`\1`); `[^/]+/` matches anything that is not a slash, and then a slash (`vag/` or `home/`); `([^/]+)/` matches the same thing, but puts the stuff found in-between slashes in the second group `\2`; and then `.+` matches whatever comes next to the end of line; and the second field tells sed to replace the line with `\1\2`, so our saved groups side-by-side: the first group was everything before the first slash, and the second group was the stuff between 2nd and 3rd slashes"

335,1500902845.173078,Gabriele,"""socket"" is lower-case, by the way... it's not a package, it's just a low-level networking concept. Error 54 / ""connection reset"" is just an obscure way of the operating system telling you that the connection was closed.; It is usually helpful to know which line the error came from (it'll be in the traceback).

If so - you may not want regex; My guess is one of your issues will be the backslashes from the windows path, which are ""escape sequences"" in regex, so `C:\0.\d`, `\0.` probably isn't what you want, `\0` is escaping ""0"" and then `.` is any char, I think a starting point may be: `C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`"

343,1500948942.209059,Beula,"It actually does need the escapes in the regex string, it gets compiled and `\d` is a ""digit"", and `\0` isn't anything, so your regex needs to escape; If you read the docs for the `re` package - you'll see the same behavior I describe, all the raw strings still escape the special chars"
343,1500949068.232771,Collette,<@Jame> what google says: <http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/>
343,1500949250.266769,Beula,"<@Christa> Here is a snippet from the official docs:

&gt; Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal.
&gt; 
&gt; *The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r""\n"" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while ""\n"" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation."
343,1500949367.28816,Christa,"I'm sort of confused.  Do I have to prefix the string with a function 

 re(`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`); re(`""C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe""`); or re(r`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`)"

343,1500949473.308362,Christa,Any suggestions to the correct approach?; Or at least a working one
343,1500949510.315561,Beula,"If it's always an incrementing number, the easy solution is list the directory (`os.listdir`), convert them into floats, and take the highest"

I am not familiar with the os library and I was familiar with regex so I wouldnt have thought of that solution without you!; As a follow up, as a beginner python programmer, how was I supposed to know that os.listdir was a valid path to take without asking someone else for their sage advice"
343,1500949807.371701,Beula,"You did the right thing, you asked for help! That's a good way to find other solutions.; What you had is called an X-Y problem, you wanted to get the next file - and thought regex was the answer so you asked how to do the regex; Those of us that have been around the block once or twice try to understand the actual problem, to make sure we answer the right question"
343,1500950012.411399,Christa,"You're right.  I shouldve just asked how to do it, at first. I still want to learn how to use regex tho :stuck_out_tongue:; Oh well, hopefully another time. Thanks, again!"
343,1500950050.418754,Beula,"If you want to do the regex way you'd do something similar, you'd use a ""capture group"", convert them to floats, then compare. Much more involved and harder to maintain :smile:; it probably still requires listing the dir too"

What's le difference?"
345,1500962164.450205,Willena,<@Thomasina> the first example sets an SRID of 4386 (WGS84).  the second example doesn't set an SRID and should get the default for geometry which is 0

345,1500963120.638348,Willena,"Depends what your doing.  When SRID is 0, the data gets treated like it's on a Cartesian plane (flat).  Using 4326 allows for a round earth.  If you're trying to do things like get the distance between two points, it can make a difference."

347,1500975133.469262,Ciera,Maybe because the default software for it is `excel` and windows do some tricks; is it doing the same with an existing file ?
347,1500975265.519169,Gabriele,"Looks like it uses registry settings, and doesn't examine actual files, just filenames"

347,1500976070.817853,Meg,"so, if you use something like pgadmin; and open up the tree down to your new database; so postgis is in your db extensions?; also, what is your query you're running; usually when you get this issue with postgis, it means you're inputing invalid types in the function"

347,1500976599.013084,Ciera,postgres might need a restart when you install postgis
347,1500976764.073951,Meg,especially on windows; because you can't update certain files when the system is running; so you ether need to restart the service or reboot

356,1501002378.988679,Beula,`datetime.now()` against a timefield will be date/time; `date.now()` may work; I think you may need a between query for start/end of the day

359,1501007286.9432,Celine,"Hello,

I would like to test a system with several AMQP consumer/producers that are exchanging messages with each other.
I would like to have unit-testing with those consumers. Is there a commonly used design pattern for doing so in Python? (I'm using pytest at the moment with a fixture that look like this:; At the moment my set-up is this:
My consumers inherit from multiprocessing.Process and when started set-up their AMQP environment.
When the test is finished, the terminate closes the connection and cancel everything.
The problem that I get is that even when a test completed, the Process of the consumers seems to continue running in the background even after I called terminate.

How could I have a nice clean-up when the test is over? Would it change something to have BlockingConnection instead of a SelectConnection ?

Here is the current version of my base class for those components: <https://gist.github.com/sieben/caf39e04a83c812550d967a22b9d8584> is an obvious flaw in it? Is there an alternative from inheriting from Thread or Process ?"

360,1501012854.090145,Ciera,well the stacktraces is pretty explicit; python as a recursion limit that you reached
360,1501012888.108771,Myong,"Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't actually setup the module properly; But it's odd that it goes between the two over and over I'm trying to get to it in debug"
360,1501012935.136511,Ciera,well in fact the `__getattr__` func call `setup` and `setup` call `__getattr__` so it's endless
360,1501013003.174341,Myong,cant even debug to where it breaks
360,1501013058.204835,Ciera,well it breaks as soon as the class is init or called; as `__getattr__` is used quite a lot
360,1501013218.291672,Myong,"Yeah, looking at some stuff now it basically says if `__getattrb__` can access a variable which does not yet exist it will go into infinite recursion; alright got rid of the module, not sure what was happening, figured out a different way"

364,1501056629.030438,Marcie,in both cases i would say to freeze all dependencies with `pip freeze` anyways and then put `pip list --outdated` as part of your continuous integration process to let you know about newer versions
364,1501056863.115494,Junita,"I think it’s problematic for a library to specifically require a version of its dependencies, since unlike say npm Python dependencies are global; I’m pretty sure if I have two dependencies, A and B, which both depend on C, and they specify different versions of C, there is going to be a problem, right?"

I want to write a program to get the MySQL status through the command line.
E.g The command what I am doing is 
`msqladmin -u username -p password status`
(there is no space between -p and password.)
But I don't want to provide password through the command line. But give the input as password to the command line on asking password. Like 
```
msqladmin -u username -p status

password ******

Maybe it's something stupid, but I'm not too sure.; I need to attach a command to a button in tkinter, and it has to be able to attach to another widget/Frame which does not yet exist. So without using `lambda` I get an error because the key does not exist within the dictionary; But I also need to run more than one single expression; How can I reference something that does not exist?; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked."
385,1501169531.707725,Beula,Look at `functools.partial`
385,1501169608.760751,Myong,Well here's what happens; So I have a main root for my application
385,1501169628.774151,Suellen,&gt; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
385,1501169631.776292,Myong,"and I have 3 classes, one for each different ""page"" which are all `Tk.Frame` objects"

385,1501169731.842272,Myong,"Now in order to show the next frame after a submit button I have to have the next Frame available and already initialized. However in order to initialize the Frame which I want to show I have to also create that function that runs on click which requires the next Frame to also be initializied, but it hasn't been initialized yet because the first one is still being initializied lol; Slightly confusing I will show code"
385,1501169758.860346,Suellen,"wait, lambdas ""execute"" when you access them; i.e. `lambda: func(x)` - `func` won't be called until you click the button"
385,1501169798.886822,Myong,"There is basically a `dict` with `Frame: Frame obj`; When it hit's the Repos Frame, it gets to this function; `self.submit = Button(self, text=""Submit"", command=submit(self, controller))`"

385,1501170412.296761,Myong,It works

I'm trying to grab a selection and place it inside a label to show a user what they selected, but in the same way as before it places the default value into the label instead of grabbing the updated one."
385,1501171377.941753,Beula,If `lambda: func()` works just `func` should also work...
385,1501171386.947853,Myong,But it doesn't that's the thing lol
385,1501171412.964659,Beula,"Lambda is just a function reference, without a name. so setting `lambda: func()` is the same as `func`; Sounds like some other error, but if it works that's good :smile: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
385,1501171582.075041,Myong,"It's because it, for whatever reason attempts to access a key in a dict that doesn't exist and it steps into the function i attach to `command` if I just do `lambda: func()` it doesn't actually go into the function til it's finally clicked"
385,1501171604.089417,Collette,"<@Beula> `func` and `lambda: func(foo, bar)` are different :wink:"

385,1501172057.369673,Suellen,"<@Myong> can you show a bit of code? maybe it's something obvious; nooo waaay; you, mister, should have a cup of coffee :coffee:"
385,1501172371.559267,Myong,"I actually got it; I just pass the controller in, grab the dictionary of frames and get the variable from the corresponding frame; But this is quite annoying :slightly_smiling_face:"

385,1501172500.636904,Myong,I just need 4 screens; that's it
385,1501172503.638884,Suellen,there's a good side though: you better understand what happens under the wraps in other GUI frameworks
385,1501172506.640666,Myong,"god is this bad; Should have just made a frontend, honestly; just attempting to format this is so bad."
385,1501172667.735698,Beula,"That's a bit rude, but I challenge you to show me how this case above is not the same, vs just saying it's not. Here is proof it is:

```

...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: print(""bar"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo

You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case); ```

&lt;class 'function'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(bar)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;

385,1501173033.952986,Suellen,therefore it's a common pattern to hide the stuff that you actually need to do behind a simple unassuming lambda

391,1501193563.915936,Thelma,make it more efficient
391,1501193566.917207,Jed,"basically there are 3-5 files in each zipped folder: file_a, file_b, file_c, file_d

I wanted to make it so that the filename would increment, file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2"
391,1501194058.082451,Deedee,"so there is a conflict w/ i here.; on line 12 you initialize it to 0.

391,1501195667.581328,Deedee,"yeah. So basically what you are trying to do is change the name of the file inside the zip and then unzip, right?"

393,1501194460.211472,Deedee,"just to be clear, this happens automatically when you `for i, f in enumerate(pet_list):`; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD."
394,1501196370.785133,Jed,yeap!
394,1501196905.940916,Deedee,"Check this out: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982034/how-can-i-extract-files-using-custom-names-with-zipfile-module-from-python>; looks like unziping to a tmp folder might be the way to go.; &gt; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD.
What I said here, is wrong. Zip file is one that is getting overwritten. NOT the files inside the zip.; so if there are existing files of `file_a`, it should create `file_a_0` and then `file_a_1`, and so on? It just keeps adding to file_a_watever-count and file_b_whatever-count, depending on the files that have already been extracted?"
394,1501197366.065457,Johana,anytime i open a file in pycharm it says loading … arggg. why does this happen when i have something really important to fix.
394,1501197867.194293,Jed,"file_a_0, file_a_1
or file_a, file_a_1

are all acceptable!"

If you get file_a_1, file_a_4, file_a_7 then just play w/ this. Also, had line 11 one indentation back so it was trying to unzip/extract file from previous iteration, that were the file not found error coming from"

My api gets some data from somewhere else and sends it to my website upon request.; when I hit the api directly, like through a valid route, I get the data and no error; but when I go through my website, which will eventually generate the same url and send a request to my api, I get a broken pipe.; both of the services are running on my computer; when I use the deployed version of the website (AWS), I get no error; only get broken pipe locally"

400,1501249146.2935,Ray,"hi guys. anyone here know any solutions to having a python script create a list of objects parallel to another script consuming those objects as they are created?; i’ve got some test automation where each test requires a brand new account, but the accounts take anywhere between 30s-2min to create. i’d like to create the accounts parallel to the tests running to speed up execution time. i’ve found a way using `multiprocessing.Process` and continuously adding accounts to a `multiprocessing.Queue`, but this only works if that process is started from within the same script that executes the tests. i have a use case that requires the test execution to be able to consume a pre-made account as soon as the test starts executing, so `multiprocessing.Process` does not fully solve my problem, since the first test to execute still has to wait for the first account to be created and added to the queue; what would be ideal is a way to create a queue of accounts from a `create_accounts.py` script that i can execute at any time, and then be able to consume that queue at any arbitrary point in time _during_ or _after_ `create_accounts.py`"

405,1501264469.882847,Myong,"gotcha; bunch of missing modules also; Seems like the main error are two of my module missing due to `invalid module`; Okay so inspecting the archive of my imported modules it does seem that I do not have the two modules; Im quite lost here. There's not much documentation on how to force a module import; And I can't figure out why the two modules are invalid; I get a bunch of `Missing Module` warning s, but only two `Invalid Module` warnings for two of my modules imported in `main.py` and I'm not sure why they're invalid"
406,1501267515.488497,Suellen,is this pyinstaller-related?
406,1501267525.494299,Myong,Yes; I've renamed them
406,1501267748.612839,Suellen,"oh, I've never seen an invalid module thing; but for missing modules there's a `hidden_imports` directive; pyinstaller isn't very good at detecting what modules are used by a program :confused:"
406,1501268066.777442,Myong,I've even got it as a hidden import; Yeah I have no clue what the invalid module is; There is nothing about it; I can't find anything online
406,1501268132.811292,Suellen,What's the module in question?
406,1501268180.835686,Myong,"Two modules, one uses `openpyxl` and populates an excel workbook with some data, another is just a single popup window for a notification that the file has finished being generated"
406,1501268278.886577,Suellen,"oh damn, openpyxl"
406,1501268286.89071,Myong,Is that why?
406,1501268291.893256,Suellen,"yeah, I spent a couple of hours fighting it"

406,1501268328.913071,Suellen,"wait, does it compile OK and then the program doesn't work, or it doesn't compile altogether?; don't lose hope just yet :slightly_smiling_face:"
406,1501268368.933261,Myong,"Like the raw code? It all works, but of course without those two modules, or at least the openpyxl module it wont; Im gonna comment them out; only two lines in my project; and see what happens; building it now in pyinstaller; won't even run at all actually, just opens and closes"
406,1501268551.02841,Suellen,run it from cmd.exe to see the error
406,1501268558.031745,Myong,okay; `Error loading Python DLL: C:\...\main\python35.dll`
406,1501268780.142606,Suellen,welllllll that's something else entirely :x
406,1501268848.175455,Myong,oh wait was it this; Cause I saw something about this earlier; `_MEIPASS2 is NULL`
406,1501268898.199802,Suellen,I remember there was some entity called `_MEIPASS2` but I didn't mess with it at all; <https://pastebin.com/Xihf4DdV>; My build.spec for pyinstaller
406,1501269692.573689,Myong,I believe it's for `--onefile` flag; let me link to my python dir in `pathex`...; It's trying to pull python 3.5 dll from my build directory.; <@Suellen> should the python35.dll be in that build directory?; why is my specfile being overwritten every single time
406,1501271184.259666,Suellen,there should be a single exe file

407,1501269543.503778,Suellen,why is this needed at all? :confused:
408,1501269922.680268,Susie,thank you <@Johana>
409,1501272855.011467,Suellen,the specfile is generated for you to edit and use instead of passing parameters to pyinstaller
409,1501272865.016065,Meghan,It creates a spec unless you run it from a spec.
409,1501272872.019031,Suellen,i.e. you create a spec and then do `pyinstaller main.spec`
409,1501272879.021935,Meghan,Instead of specifying the .py file specify .spec
409,1501273077.109172,Myong,gotcha; Trying to add `python35.dll` to the dir; no luck; Just another one of those days
409,1501273454.273899,Meghan,Why would you need to do that? I didn't have to do anything along those lines to distribute Windows compiled scripts.
409,1501273498.293181,Myong,I have absolutely no clue; Not sure what else needs to go in there to not get missing Python35.dll; The dll is literally in there with the `.exe` and it's attempting to pull it from somewhere else; Found a google group post regarding `vcredist`
409,1501274003.516553,Meghan,Are you compiling on Windows?
409,1501274055.539001,Myong,Yeah; I'm still wondering about the MEI thing because what happens is when I run it it says the DLL can't be found in c:/.../temp/pyinstaller/_MEIxxxx/python35.dll; No I am not at all; I have no clue where it gets that path from
409,1501274618.77836,Meghan,"pyinstaller with the onefile flag should really be including that with it.; That path is where your files are extracted to.; ```
def resource_path(relative_path):

     This is used to find included data files in pyinstaller version
    pyinstaller makes an environment variable? that has path to the included data files

This is what I've used to access included files, such as textfsm templates."
409,1501274692.810172,Myong,Where should this go?; Top of main file?; Or hook
409,1501274727.825146,Meghan,"No, you use that in your open lines.; Example:
```
        with open(resource_path('templates/jinja2/evc-map.jinja')) as f:
            template = f.read()
            jinja = Template(template)
```; But, with your missing dll, something else is going wrong.; Have you tried to compile something simple to see if that works?"
409,1501274853.878635,Myong,Yes I'm using a simple helloworld.py script it works fine
409,1501274995.937523,Meghan,"That's really weird. The only issues I ran into with pyinstaller were that it wasn't ready for 3.6 and I had to use the dev version, and with one of my tools for some reason it couldn't figure out the imports so I had to manually specify every single import."
409,1501275006.941895,Myong,"Yeah I had to downgrade to 3.5.3; Okay so given the code to grab the _MEIPASS envar, where exactly do I need to be putting the code within open lines"
409,1501275152.001479,Meghan,"The function I gave you is if you need to open an included file. For example if you have templates or html you include in the package.; You can't use that for the python dll, because nothing is going to happen without that dll."
409,1501275228.031647,Myong,Yeah makes sense. But I just dont get this error at all. I've found so many posts on it in 2 hours and I'm just lost
409,1501275250.040532,Meghan,How do you have pyinstaller installed?
409,1501275263.046326,Myong,through pip
409,1501275296.060414,Meghan,In a virtual environment?
409,1501275325.072428,Myong,Yes
409,1501275387.09873,Meghan,"Well, you could make a short script that prints the location of the MEIPASS directory then pauses for input, then go there and see what is extracted. I don't know if it extracts the dll file and libraries there or not though."
409,1501275479.137878,Myong,"something like print(sys.MEIPASS); oh man i might have got it. closing my eyes one sec; NOPE. sweet; Well I think i give up for now before I go crazy; <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1566>

417,1501358509.383749,Susanne,Well I just sent you the relevant code for the problem; I was having

and use `main()` to start you off and maintain control of flow/logic, and when to quit."
417,1501359598.468932,Susanne,Ok I'll try that

417,1501364893.844812,Susanne,so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?
417,1501365073.856278,Deedee,no. scroll up to 11:30am. and read my reply to your previous msg; Also read this
417,1501368776.090628,Susanne,Here is the revised code; <@Deedee>
417,1501368938.100755,Deedee,remove line 167; did you look at the link I sent you to the 'example'?
417,1501369053.107835,Susanne,Yes I did? so how are you able to call main then?
417,1501369064.108488,Deedee,"it just does.; so this way, main() runs if this is run as a script... a stand-alone script.; like, you create a hello world and run it from terminal by `python helloworld.py`
```
def main():
    print ""Hello World""

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```"
417,1501369190.116479,Susanne,but I dont have scripts on my function Im using that function to call functions; but in raelity main is kinda of a useless function tbh; would you suggest getting rid of hte main functino?
417,1501369493.138195,Deedee,"no; find a way to make it work, not just w/ the `main()` function, but through it."
417,1501369843.16033,Susanne,yea its not working ill just stick to calling the main function normally; I really do not how you’re running it and its working? lol
417,1501370231.184329,Deedee,careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'; I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.; You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.; Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
417,1501370373.192858,Susanne,Are you sure you are using the code I just posted on here?; 30 mins ago?; cuz idk man it aint clicking
417,1501370551.204007,Deedee,"And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?"
417,1501370608.207439,Susanne,It doesnt even run I get nothing; I run and then it stops
417,1501370677.212098,Deedee,"yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all"
417,1501370689.212963,Susanne,I wasn’t at all
417,1501370700.213614,Deedee,had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
417,1501370720.215026,Susanne,maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn’t run if __name statement
417,1501371170.243514,Deedee,"hahaha maybe. I can't confirm or deny. But if it doesn't work, then so be it... change 158 and 159 to just call main(). And ask someone why it doesn't work the way we're talking about here. Now, back to your original question... It's obvious that lines 50 and 51 are not the correct spots to declare the lists. Did you look into passing lists to functions?"
417,1501371373.25547,Susanne,No I haven't; Well I believe i have been this entire time; Where would you recommend calling the lists?
417,1501371906.286355,Deedee,"where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?"
417,1501372074.296459,Susanne,No I didn't ; I was thinking about putting it after menu but before the books function and then returning those values; That's pretty much the one problem I've been having this whole time lol
417,1501372517.322615,Deedee,"no. that's the only thing you asked about. There are multiple probs :joy:; like, line 129, type 'one' instead of '1'; lines 12 and 13 in register() don't make sense.; and much more. but one thing at a time."
417,1501372615.328535,Susanne,Well 129 is just a print statement; So I can make it a little more clear if anything
417,1501372643.330278,Deedee,109*
417,1501372709.33432,Susanne,Again it's still a print statement; I'm deleting the list item by the index
417,1501372743.336437,Deedee,"Line 109 says: `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to find?""))`; Line 129 says `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to sell?""))`; that's user input, not a print statement."
417,1501372962.351498,Susanne,Oh my bad; Well that would work
417,1501373032.355714,Deedee,"Lines 52 and 53:
```
  for i in range(0, len(inventory)):
    print(inventory[i])
```
should be
```
for i in inventory:
    print(inventory)
```
but `i` should be more describptive, like `movie_title` or whatever.; anyway... let's look at where you said you'd post the list; &gt;  after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
What would that look like?; Since you mention 'returning values', how does register and login work? In your own words.; how do you see that code happening? can you type it up here?; okay.. so I asked about this b/c that's not how `return` works; let's start building this bad boy.
I'm guessing the first step is that the user has to register, right?; so we'll start w/; we'll move this into comments under that code snipet"
418,1501375026.472072,Susanne,"It would allow me to use this values into another function when I call a specific using the return values as parameters; yea; they create a username and a password; the password has to be 6 characters or more; I need a register and login; Ok and I'm assuming we'll use it in a little bit, right?; ok; Im just trying to figure out which extensions to download for sublime; <@Deedee> You wanna move this over to the dm?; how to do you access the key of a specific dictionary?; how do you*"
418,1501424902.245703,Beula,"<@Susanne> Can you show what you're trying to get data out of? Normally it's just `dictionary['key_to_get']` to get the value out; There's also the view method if you want to see the available keys: `dictionary.keys()`; Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?; First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there; But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`"
418,1501425269.273977,Susanne,"but i isn’t going to print out; I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer"
418,1501425541.293643,Beula,"Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict; If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with"
418,1501425591.297261,Susanne,Thats im trying to do by converting it into a tuple; but i guess that doesnt work
418,1501425657.302534,Beula,"Dictionaries don't keep order until python 3.6, just an FYI - so that could work if you save it to a variable first, then ask for input; So maybe something like: 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = list(enumerate(d.items()))
&gt;&gt;&gt; options
[(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, (k, v) in options:
...   print(""select"", i,"" for "", k)
...
select 0  for  Game of Thrones
&gt;&gt;&gt; options[0]
(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))
```; Actually in that case, probably better to just do `options = list(d.items())` which will give you a list of tuples, then from there the `i` value is the array index"
418,1501426001.327203,Susanne,‘float’ object is not iterable; that was the error I got
418,1501426274.347653,Beula,Looking <@Susanne>; just a minute
418,1501426279.34803,Susanne,ok
418,1501426387.356179,Beula,What line is the error in the stacktrace <@Susanne>; `enumerate(options)`; sorry
418,1501426783.386,Susanne,ok then what would I put if I wanted to print out he key and value?
418,1501426812.389009,Beula,How about you tell me on that one :slightly_smiling_face: Try it a bit and then report back if you are stuck; I don't want to give you too many answers to prohibit you learning it :slightly_smiling_face:
418,1501426836.391411,Susanne,I would continue using options correct?
418,1501426890.396097,Beula,"Yep; You can grab it from options, which is a list of tuples `[(key, value)] -&gt; [(""Movie Name"", float_val)]`; So `options[i][0]` and `options[i][1]`"
418,1501427357.434719,Susanne,"It says “list indices must be integers or slices, not str”; thats the snippet I ran"
418,1501427435.4411,Beula,The question you need to ask yourself is which thing in that snippet can give you a string that is used in `options`?
418,1501427468.443686,Susanne,the str function
418,1501427477.444371,Beula,You aren't using the `str` function; The issue is that you are passing a `str` as an index
418,1501427508.446596,Susanne,can you use int?
418,1501427529.44817,Beula,"That's what you want to use in a list :slightly_smiling_face:; Check this doc on `input` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input>; &gt; The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string"
418,1501427745.464749,Susanne,ok; Now how would validate the input?; at least what would be the thing I am looking for in the while statement?
418,1501427838.472247,Beula,"I'll leave that to you for a little to try out, let me know if you hit your head on it too long"
418,1501427879.475252,Susanne,hint at least? pretty please with sprinkles on top :smile:
418,1501428479.523512,Beula,"You have a list of things, you need to make sure the input is in that list :wink:"

418,1501428570.530833,Beula,Test it out; the nice thing about programming is you can test theories pretty easily :smile:
418,1501428595.532759,Susanne,that is true; I got this “‘list’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer”
418,1501428997.56725,Beula,And which thing in that is a `list`?

432,1501568063.783116,Beula,sure thing
433,1501577699.732191,Lanita,"So, I've been using `__all__` for some time now to quickly declare to the programmer which functions of a module is to be used by other modules (more or less, when you open a file, the ""entry point(s)"" that other files that import this file uses can be found by reading `__all__`). It's quite helpful, but the problem is that e.g. sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions. This makes sense if I'm writing API docs, but not so much if I want to cover all functions.

How would you handle this issue?"
433,1501577778.763161,Ciera,`sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions` there should be an option to activate it for all functions
433,1501577848.791161,Lanita,Is that reasonable though? Maybe it's me who should rethink what the documentation should be used for.
433,1501577903.812615,Collette,<@Lanita> it's unusual to write a non-api documentation in the source code
433,1501578008.855122,Lanita,"<@Collette> Why? If I write valid rst docstrings for private functions they can be used by other tools; I suppose that one of the reasons I care about this is that sphinx won't pass over my private functions by default, and thus I won't get any indication of rst syntax warnings/errors in my private functions, so they'll likely be broken and not noticed"
433,1501578217.938602,Ciera,well in this case they shouldn't be private
433,1501578272.959714,Lanita,"But sometimes the gritty details needs an explanation/overview, and that might as well be in rst, right? That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be private. Equating private with ""doesn't need docstring"" seems weird to me"
433,1501578303.971881,Gabriele,"I agree with <@Lanita> . Documentation isn't just for end-users; it's for coworkers. Or myself, in future."
433,1501578369.99772,Lanita,"In my case, my sphinx documentation is 100% for co-workers that can code, and that will probably continue to be the case for some time.; But the thing is, my coworker might as well read the code to begin with, so maybe it makes sense to only declare the interfaces, given how readable raw rst is and python's readability in general..."
433,1501578466.034474,Gabriele,"I disagree; ""read the source"" is a poor substitute for good documentation"
433,1501578501.047436,Ciera,I don't understand what do you want <@Lanita> ? sphinx to generate doc for private method that have docstrings ?
433,1501578530.05845,Lanita,"That is what people *say*, but in reality, do people work like that? It's one thing to use a library, but when you're adding functionality to a codebase?; The reason I'm saying this is that my coworkers seem to be the people that prefers to read the source code directly, but maybe they're just used to an environment without documentation... sigh.; <@Ciera> I suppose I want a general discussion on how documentation is to be used, which I suppose would fit better in random. Oh well."
433,1501578677.114038,Collette,"<@Lanita> because api changes, but general ideas and core functionality often doesn't change"
433,1501578683.11627,Gabriele,"Source code and documentation go hand in hand. If I have documentation, I'll go there first. It also helps to communicate intent _far_ quicker than reading code does."
433,1501578699.122142,Collette,"Because when you try to express everything in __doc__, `help(obj)` becomes unreadable"
433,1501578739.137319,Lanita,"<@Collette> , so you leave off private functions entirely in your fancy-looking documentation? (e.g. sphinx)"
433,1501578750.141558,Collette,"Yes. That's why they're private; I can include them into a ""how to read the source code"" guide though"
433,1501578954.218304,Lanita,"<@Collette> that certainly seems like a sensible approach, and probably the most applicable to my use case. But it does push other developers towards ""read the source"" fairly quickly. Which I suppose is what is happening in my organization anyways.; So, defining __all__ in every python file is a reasonable idea, I presume? Any places where I shouldn't be doing that?"
433,1501579033.2488,Collette,"Well, you can't cover everything with docs. Sometimes you have to hijack the library and do dirty stuff. That's why I often write ""how to read the source code"" guides; But still, `__all__` is a must"
433,1501579080.266512,Lanita,"Seems reasonable. Any pointers (blog posts, whatever) on how to write such guides? At what level should they be?; I usually use the top-level docstring to explain intent, and that usually includes mentions of both public and private functions. Though should I consider the top-level docstring to be public or private?"
433,1501579552.448023,Collette,"I put them in docs, not in `__doc__`. I try to explain the flow of a single successful request, how it goes from the entry point to the handler. And how you can hijack various parts of the handler if they aren't specified as the public api; If the intent of the library isn't clear, or the module names aren't obvious for a novice reader, I often document where's the entry point and if there is some private stuff that gets overridden by children classes"
434,1501582606.571186,Cassaundra,Hi; Could anyone advise me how to scrape the data from the Javascript Webpages?; I'm trying to scrape the data from from this website but im unable to scrape any field:unamused:; The website i'm trying to scrape the data is <https://munchery.com/menus/sf/#/0/dinner>; Thanks for the advise:slightly_smiling_face:

434,1501583382.820669,Cassaundra,Sorry couldn't get you; i have no idea about JS
434,1501583470.849889,Gabriele,"If the data is all being served up by Javascript then you can't scrape it. You'll want to watch which calls are being made to get the JSON data (or equivalent), and replicate those to get the data; Or ask Munchery if they have an API you can use"
434,1501587177.991037,Patty,"<@Cassaundra> also please check the terms of service of a site before asking questions about things that could violate TOS like scraping. The sites TOS is pretty clear on that, so your questions are better in <#C68GBADG8|etc_greyhat>"
434,1501587380.054096,Cassaundra,<@Patty> Ok:+1:
435,1501595710.747442,Zaida,"Simple one off question that I’ve thought too much about:
I made a website in Django that does a whole bunch of different things for me as a teacher, like gradebooks, assigning math problems to specific students, doling out digital awards, scraping the sites we use, sending parent letters, etc. When I describe it quickly to actual developers/programmers, what’s the easiest way to describe something like that?
Website? App? Program? What’s the usual term for a django site?"
435,1501595879.856427,Beula,"You're bordering on a ""LMS"" (Learning Management System) - but I usually just say ""site"".

In my anecdotal experience:

1. site/website -&gt; normal web application
2. webapp -&gt; borders on 1, but usually this gets more into more client side stuff, or an SPA type setup with an API and more functionality than the standard forms of a site
3. program -&gt; pretty vague, could be website, desktop app, etc.
4. app -&gt; often mobile specific

But given a little context anyone will catch your drift"
435,1501595918.881913,Zaida,"Interesting, so teaching websites like mine have their own acronym? Good to know; Webapp is what I’ve been shooting for. Thanks! After making it for a year, I’ve only just started talking about it with people who know any coding and quickly realized I don’t know how to describe it to anyone who knows their stuff."
435,1501596415.209746,Beula,"LMS is a bit more, but sounds like you have a lot of one. Blackboard, Desire2Learn, Instructure Canvas, Moodle, all examples of LMS related sites"
435,1501598386.499653,Zaida,"Yeah, I checked out a few and it’s definitely not at the level of most of those, but seems to have some overlap. :taco: to you, <@Beula>; Well I screwed that up."
435,1501599284.104145,Beula,<@Zaida> :taco: for solving a need for your work! Do you come from programming or pick it up for this project?
435,1501602984.620243,Zaida,"<@Beula> Picked it up last summer to make my teaching more efficient/effective. But now I’m looking to learn enough to become a professional developer and hopefully work for an education based company, ala Khan Academy or the like.; Spent 4 years in the classroom, and a few in Graphic design before that, so the tech/design + education is something that I’m really interested in."

435,1501604588.646278,Johana,<@Zaida> i would def. try to integrate with some LMS. for some reason it’s something that comes up last i don’t know why. we are currently making an integration with canvas.; yea we’re pretty cool. especially the fact that we make free textbooks.; we’ll be launching our first paid product this fall. <https://tutor.openstax.org/>; we’re a bit different than khan academy. i’ve met with those folks before :wink:. we actually publish research vs khan academy who doesn’t.

435,1501604715.722834,Beula,Is that the flask app mike?
435,1501604732.733528,Johana,well i’ve blown up the flask app now but yea it was the personalized learning part <@Beula>
435,1501604750.744511,Beula,What is it now?
435,1501604755.747366,Zaida,Do you see yourself as a ‘disruptive’ service? I know the price of textbooks has been a massive issue for years now.
435,1501604760.750393,Beula,"and Canvas is the best LMS from what I hear, but moodle is FOSS"
435,1501604762.751542,Johana,just pure python and api post requests.; yea we have been disrupted the market really good lately.
435,1501604780.762816,Zaida,"Way to go, man."
435,1501604784.765105,Johana,"several big book publishers have partnered with us.; which is basically saying, “since they can’t beat us they’ve joined us.” lol"

435,1501604844.802557,Johana,yea we tried to do k-12
435,1501604851.806687,Zaida,And the user interface I make for Kindergarten-4th grade (that’s all my school covers at the moment) can’t be as complicated as a blackboard or a canvas.
435,1501604855.809314,Johana,we had another product called concept coach but the grant money didn’t come in; we had to pivot to college students.
435,1501604870.818949,Zaida,Great demo to start with.
435,1501604890.831083,Johana,spaced practice is where its at.; and of course we have our own algorithms with academic papers written to compute the topic mastery of students.
435,1501604965.877908,Zaida,"Oh! Do you know of any open-source algorithms for spaced practice? I’d love to incorporate something like what Anki uses into my app, but couldn’t find anything that I thought I could use."
435,1501604976.885111,Johana,i only know of anki.; i love it; especially since it is python
435,1501604985.890985,Zaida,It’s fantastic. Is it open source?
435,1501604992.895014,Johana,ya; it uses a modified supermemo algorithm which is really good.
435,1501605018.911634,Zaida,"Interesting… I doubt I can crack it open and make sense of it, but I’ll give it a shot.; Never heard of supermemo before."
435,1501605029.918123,Johana,i’m currently experimenting with spaced practice and unstructured information.

468,1502071955.039422,Tameika,let me check; is it python-devel for mac?
468,1502072076.057021,Collette,How did you install python on your mac? Are you using built-in one?
468,1502072125.064593,Tameika,i have both python2 and python3; i am using the built in one for python2 (currently working on that for boost python); i also did: `brew reinstall python`
468,1502072187.073933,Collette,"Okay, then you need to run `xcode-select --install` to install the development headers"
468,1502072219.078479,Tameika,thats the whole command?
468,1502072222.078943,Collette,Yes

468,1502072295.089927,Tameika,"oh, how do i find if it is pre-installed or from brew?; actually i am not quite sure"

468,1502072465.115588,Collette,Then you're using the pre-installed python

468,1502072600.135422,Collette,Don't mess with your system; Also you probably haven't read the question carefully - it's about pythons installed neither by brew or system
468,1502072682.147425,Tameika,"oh ok; so, what is the best way to resolve this and make my Sunday fruitful :neutral_face: ?"
468,1502072878.177234,Collette,Start from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7375583>; Then try to include paths to the brew's python headers for cmake explicitly
468,1502073165.223078,Tameika,"ok, I ran `which -a python` and understood that there is only one version of python at `/usr/bin/python`; so, either 1. i did not use brew to install python; or 2. brew installed python at `/usr/bin`"
468,1502073289.242407,Collette,What `brew ls -v python` says?
468,1502073353.25235,Tameika,many files in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/`
468,1502073437.265192,Collette,"Do you have `/usr/local/bin` in your PATH, as SO answer suggests? Have you read that answer?"

          ^```; any thoughts on why this is the case?"
468,1502074215.382087,Marcie,"it's confusing as to why `/usr/local/bin/python` is not showing up for `which python`; though both the system and brew python should be able to find `pyconfig.h`; `/usr/bin/python-config` and `/usr/local/bin/python-config` should both return valid include directories that have `pyconfig.h` in them; like so:
```find $(/usr/bin/python-config --includes | sed ""s/-I//g"") | grep ""pyconfig.h""
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h

468,1502074465.419656,Tameika,"Yes, I have the same output; ```/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```; not for the second one; ```zsh: no such file or directory: /usr/local/bin/python-config

       find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]```; why is there no file : `/usr/local/bin/python-config` ?"
468,1502074575.437009,Marcie,weird
468,1502074598.440432,Tameika,can I just modify PYTHONPATH somehow?; that was my first question; but was told to not touch it
468,1502074667.451673,Collette,PYTHONPATH has nothing to do with your issue
468,1502074701.457037,Tameika,ok
468,1502074716.459473,Marcie,"yeah, it's the path for finding imports, your issue is finding headers for boost's C++ compilation; how are you installing boost.python domarps?"
468,1502074826.477803,Tameika,"`brew install boost-python`; i went ahead and ran this command : ```export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=""$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7""```; and when I run make now, it gives me the following error; ```[ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/hello.dir/hello.o

473,1502119203.493272,Suellen,"specific formulas are no-go, alright, but what about suggestions?"
473,1502119209.497323,Kenna,"I'm leery of the whole emojis in passwords thing, but maybe I'm just old and emoji newfangled :wink:"
473,1502119233.511117,Suellen,"like, ""your password is rated 0.38 (or just ""weak""), and most common ways to impove it are: ...""; and make a suggestion to add numbers, symbols, increase length. But no checking for specifics, just for a resulting entropy"
473,1502119285.54317,Kenna,"<@Suellen> I think the observation was that if you specify a formula, you're telling crackers the formula too. And since humans tend to work similarly it actually gives them a leg up. People tend to put capitals at the start. They tend to put ""special symbols"" and numbers at the end. Etc. If you just leave it free form then it is less likely those predictable patterns emerge"
473,1502119315.560516,Suellen,oh
473,1502119336.572975,Beula,And they swap in numerals for letters sometimes -&gt; `Password1` -&gt; `P4ssword1`
473,1502119345.578361,Suellen,"yeah, that makes sense, and that's exactly what I've been doing before keepass"
473,1502119347.579221,Beula,"The lookups are simple, lots of rainbow tables do that; But basically, require a length. For normal users discourse does 10char, for admins 15char"
473,1502119387.602967,Kenna,"Where if you make the length arbitrary and encourage longer passwords, it adds a lot of cracking time. The NIST recommendation was to support up to either 128 or 256 char passwords I believe. It specified a minimum of 8, which IMO is probably low, but it's aimed at the average user, so..."
473,1502119391.605155,Beula,"and checking agains the 100,000 most common password"
473,1502119435.632145,Suellen,"damn, 128"
473,1502119445.637735,Gabriele,"It's weird that anyone thought it was a good idea to start demanding special characters, because most people are just going to add 1 of them to meet the requirement, whereas simply making the password longer by a few characters would have a stronger benefit with no effect on how easy it is to remember"
473,1502119447.639258,Suellen,holy guacamole
473,1502119488.66334,Ciera,256 char passwords ? that require a password manager
473,1502119490.664622,Beula,If you want Jeff's suggestions (not the angry rant) -&gt; start here: <https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/#1passwordrulesarebullshit>
473,1502119495.668084,Ciera,which is by itself a security risk
473,1502119554.703409,Gabriele,I think the idea is _up to_ 256 characters. With most online web apps you can just use a varchar or equivalent
473,1502119569.712175,Suellen,good thing postgres doesn't enforce length on varchars
473,1502119577.717072,Beula,"Basically:

1. Rules are dumb
2. Enforce a minimum unicode length (emoji -&gt; 1 ""character"" in many length checkers... is the example)
3. Check against the common password (approx 30% of people have a password from the top 10,000)
4. Check of entropy 
5. Check special cases (containing username, first, or last); Just use TEXT with postgres :stuck_out_tongue:"
473,1502119605.735029,Kenna,"<@Suellen> You hash the password so it gets down to a predictable, probably fixed, length anyway"

473,1502119610.737882,Suellen,`varchar` without `max_length` is a `text` as far as pg is concerned; so that's good
473,1502119656.765864,Beula,"&gt; To sum it all up:
&gt; 
&gt; char(n) – takes too much space when dealing with values shorter than n, and can lead to subtle errors because of adding trailing spaces, plus it is problematic to change the limit
&gt; varchar(n) – it's problematic to change the limit in live environment
&gt; varchar – just like text
&gt; text – for me a winner – over (n) data types because it lacks their problems, and over varchar – because it has distinct name"

473,1502119716.802703,Kenna,"<@Ciera> NSCS/GCHQ (UK) is officially recommending password managers now, also mentioned in Troy's post"

473,1502120590.333444,Beula,I was just looking through the django docs on what they use by default - and they suggest argon2 as well

475,1502132531.920167,Meghan,"Saw the password stuff from earlier. So much of the web, and business, is doing passwords so wrong. If there is a length limitation it is scary, because length doesn't matter much if it is hashed anyway."

475,1502132680.99938,Beula,"Length does matter with hashing, each additional character increases the hash entropy significantly - as far as I understand it; Sure the end hash is the same length"

479,1502193534.870513,Tandra,"all models require one field to be a primary key, how exactly are you trying to use the autofield?; is this going to be your primary key because if so then it should be set as true not false; if it's not going to be your primary key then set another field as the primary_key=True but remove the false from autofield; the error is just saying it cannot be false; which is correct; read the link i pasted, it explains it much clearer tbh"

483,1502211852.399424,Beula,Agreed with <@Collette> . PyCharm is the most feature filled - but that may hinder learning
483,1502211874.412569,Ela,best place to start learning the python language is <http://python.org|python.org>?
483,1502211883.417908,Johana,i think the way it helps enforce styles and auto-completion is useful.; i started with an IDE and i’ve done a number of other things w/o it and have been fine.; “best” is a rather subjective term but i really liked the google 2 day class.; you might also like codeacademy. it’s interactive and in the browser.; the only thing about the google 2 day class is they use 2 spaces instead of 4. I didn’t follow that but as long as you’re consistent your fine.; <https://developers.google.com/edu/python/>
483,1502212302.661359,Ela,<@Johana> Thanks. Should I get the  Learn Python the Hard way book ?
483,1502212310.665984,Beula,Nope
483,1502212324.673999,Johana,we don’t recommend zed shaw’s stuff here
483,1502212325.674777,Beula,The author is pretty hostile toward the Python community
483,1502212347.687364,Johana,automate the boring stuff is one i can’t stop hearing good things about; <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>
483,1502212380.706195,Beula,It's free online!
483,1502212436.738858,Johana,you could also ask <@Collette> to be your personal mentor but i’ve tried and he told me to gtfo.
483,1502212459.752404,Orpha,<http://pythonlearn.com/>
483,1502212474.761001,Johana,have we covered this in the learning resources?
483,1502212481.765293,Orpha,idk
483,1502212506.780234,Johana,yup; <https://github.com/pyslackers/learning-resources/blob/master/topics/essentials.md>; <@Ela> :point_up:
483,1502212523.790332,Collette,<@Johana> I can be your personal mentor only if we talk in russian :slightly_smiling_face:
483,1502212534.797114,Johana,i need to learn russian quick.
483,1502212595.833115,Ela,Thank you guys
483,1502212642.860276,Orpha,learning-resources seems a little light
483,1502212656.868366,Johana,what’s interesting is the tutorials out there from ppl who have not ever held a python job. that’s kinda interesting.
483,1502212659.870093,Beula,It's not been prioritized much recently
483,1502212667.874568,Orpha,ah ok
483,1502212676.879691,Johana,well the community should be helping fill that stuff up. lol; one day
483,1502212682.883677,Orpha,lol
483,1502212686.885664,Beula,Ideally!
483,1502212706.897329,Johana,did you use that site <@Orpha> ?
483,1502212716.902982,Orpha,<http://pythonlearn.com/> ?
483,1502212721.906022,Johana,ya
483,1502212729.911235,Beula,So far only a few of us have been pretty active on the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - others come and go and add a little bit as they have time
483,1502212742.918829,Orpha,its the site for a coursera class; python for everyone
483,1502212756.9268,Johana,ah i see the MOOC link
483,1502212758.927969,Orpha,or something like that; but he updated it from py2 to py3
483,1502212785.943455,Johana,i think this is what a couple ppl from work are doing.
483,1502212785.943525,Orpha,"and i added foundation to his site, it looks bad now, but it was way worse haha; i haven’t actually taken the course; i took a different one"
483,1502212872.995402,Johana,"nice license on his stuff too:

&gt; Note to people teaching Python: These materials are Copyright Creattive Commons Attribution 2.5. You are welcome to use these in your courses any way you like. You can make copies and host them yourselves if you like."
483,1502212872.995699,Orpha,"but… hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken it; yea, and his book has been translated to many other languages from what i remember"
483,1502212972.054591,Johana,i like the intro to his book. i have an interest in this so its cool to see the different ways ppl start out their “why you should learn programming” introductions.
483,1502212981.060052,Winnifred,The Coursera Rice Sponsored Python track was good.; If that hasn’t been mentioned already.
483,1502212994.067852,Johana,o wait.. that’s probably the one ppl are doing at work.; i know it’s on coursera.; our director has a course on there too for signal processing.
483,1502213048.099532,Winnifred,I took that track 4 years ago and it was great if you dedicate the time.
483,1502213059.105718,Johana,i know b/c we use a lot of his seed data for experiments :wink:.; i did the edx MIT 6.0.0.1 and 2 course.
483,1502213087.122829,Orpha,<https://github.com/csev/py4e>; ^ the repo for everything related to that course
483,1502213272.233309,Johana,"this one starts in AUG <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11?utm_source=OCW&amp;utm_medium=CHP&amp;utm_campaign=OCW>; the instructor is awesome. he also has a python textbook.; however, i like the coursera interface more than edx.; SO MANY CHOICES !!!"
483,1502213392.305219,Tandra,the edx interface reminds me of them clickbait links with 30 pictures each on seperate pages :neutral_face:
483,1502213410.316718,Orpha,lol
483,1502213414.319002,Beula,Looks like we have some new ideas for our learning-resources repo
484,1502211759.343496,Ela,"Hi, what's the best python IDE for a newbie?"
485,1502212204.60444,Danille,<@Suellen> thank u!
486,1502215874.834249,Johana,"yea, i’ll PR a few of these in."
486,1502216351.116813,Orpha,I'm also hoping to finish writing this book on flask. <#C3GFPUBGF|shameless_plug> 
486,1502216486.197593,Johana,nice you have a flask book? you going to compete with the good ol’ miguel grinberg.
486,1502216503.20712,Orpha,Likely not. lol; My book is pretty niche ; Sort of a how to put flask into production 
486,1502216559.241175,Johana,yea i had my own ideas in that area too. we’ll have stuff for the community at some point.
486,1502216570.247632,Orpha,Nice 
486,1502217439.780743,Johana,i got an email about this today. it seems pretty good.; <http://python101.pythonlibrary.org/>
486,1502217483.807914,Meghan,"That book does look good. I got a free copy when he gave it away on Reddit last year, and have bookmarked the link since he posted it online for free now."
486,1502217496.815761,Johana,haha i did the free copy thing too.
486,1502217521.830734,Meghan,"That may have been how I ended up using ConfigObj for everything, I think."
486,1502217563.855371,Johana,soooo many free resources. that’s why i’m shocked when ppl pay for classes and they are learning on their own.
486,1502217579.865236,Meghan,I know. And so many of the classes are outdated or poorly done.
486,1502217599.876558,Johana,for work i can see being sent to some training.
486,1502217601.877983,Meghan,"I've been doing this for 18 months, I think, and that book still has things I've not done."
486,1502217894.052986,Tandra,"humblebookbundle recently did a bunch of python books, can't wait to get stuck into them. the resources for learning are pretty awesome"
486,1502218150.206347,Orpha,"i really liked violent python, but it was in python-2.x"
486,1502218298.295695,Tandra,"i have that but haven't read it yet, does it matter if it's py2 specific?"
486,1502218305.299294,Johana,these days it isn’t a stretch to go py2 to py3
486,1502218315.305233,Tandra,thats what i was thinking too
487,1502225331.257858,Bruno,anyone here deploying docker containers on aws in production? curious how you're doing it. theres different ways.
488,1502226007.627008,Orpha,"its not too bad. it would just be nice to copy code directly and see it work.; its actually not a problem for me at all; ill still code in 2.x; im slowly starting to write more 3.x now; but every time i tell <@Bruno> i got a new book, the first thing he asks is if its py2 or py3"
488,1502226159.710246,Bruno,lol. mostly because of how stubborn you used to be on using 2. so now its more habit and amusing.
488,1502226183.722823,Orpha,lol; back when i was mostly webscraping using urllib.. i didn’t like that i had to decode it in 3
488,1502226225.745778,Bruno,you should just write your own version of that book in python 3 (with async of course) and make it forward compatible with python 4
488,1502226241.75421,Orpha,no; lol; im gonna be just as stubborn about py4 (wtf is that) and async as i was about py2; lol
488,1502226293.781156,Tandra,is there a big thing between py2 and 3 still?
488,1502226333.802188,Orpha,"as far as i know, just a differences in the imports / things being bytes instead of strings"
488,1502226335.802997,Bruno,not as much anymore.; theres more differences underneath. but most arent too much of an issue. unless you are Zed Shaw
488,1502226371.821545,Orpha,"also, isn’t 3.6 when lists and dicts were ordered?"
488,1502226378.825113,Bruno,yes
488,1502226394.833329,Tandra,"i read the zed shaw stuff, he sounds a bit crazy imo tbh"
488,1502226398.835681,Beula,"dicts, lists are always ordered"
488,1502226400.836193,Bruno,there were _technically_ ordered before. it just wasnt garanteed
488,1502226404.838188,Ciera,yeah but better not based your code on that
488,1502226419.846612,Orpha,^ thats what i meant
488,1502226423.848336,Ciera,it's now garanteed but subject to change as it's an implementation detail
488,1502226423.848515,Bruno,yea you shouldnt; yea
488,1502226435.854443,Ciera,i don't know if they are in PyPi
488,1502226441.857222,Bruno,yes they are; thats where they got the new code from
488,1502226450.861945,Tandra,would there ever be a reason for it to be unordered ?
488,1502226460.866323,Bruno,they stoled it
488,1502226460.866703,Tandra,seems like a step backwards if that ever happens
488,1502226460.866728,Ciera,speed I guess
488,1502226476.874407,Tandra,speed should never matter though surly?
488,1502226479.875791,Bruno,i think it was still an improvement if I recall
488,1502226497.884848,Ciera,dict speed is pretty important as almost everything is a dict in python
488,1502226510.890891,Orpha,it was always weird when id pull a random out of a list
488,1502226512.892043,Bruno,since they changed other things or how part of the algorithm worked. i think.
488,1502226518.89535,Ciera,it was an improvement but I'm talking about the future
488,1502226538.905115,Bruno,yea
488,1502226539.905468,Ciera,maybe someone will find a new algorithm much faster but that isn't ordered
488,1502226540.905532,Beula,3.6 has a ton of dict improvements!
488,1502226560.915335,Bruno,yup.
488,1502226560.915453,Ciera,yeah there are great talks from raymond hettinger about them
488,1502226578.923988,Bruno,"they got a lot from pypy too. so hopefully, it will help them catch up faster"
488,1502226583.926419,Ciera,if you are on 3.5 no reason to not use 3.6
488,1502226598.933591,Bruno,hettinger has a lot of good talks anyways
488,1502226612.939977,Ciera,with their funding pypi is improving a lot their python 3 support
488,1502226622.945275,Bruno,yea. thanks to Mozilla.; they got intitial 3.5 support super fast
488,1502226639.953601,Beula,That's a company I would love to work with
488,1502226644.955814,Bruno,same.
488,1502226659.963204,Ciera,yeah but not sure it's financially stable enough
488,1502226679.973188,Bruno,"i have heard redhat is nice to work for too. i technically applied recently, but never heard anything.; i dont think it is yet"
488,1502226697.981596,Ciera,working on ansible :smile:
488,1502226697.981755,Beula,Mozilla has millions annually just for featuring Yahoo as the default search engine
488,1502226711.988414,Bruno,heh
488,1502226718.991398,Ciera,yeah but it's all based on donation. It can stop at any time
488,1502226725.994816,Bruno,what % of yahoos income is that. lol
488,1502226741.002495,Beula,I think that one is contractually obligated for 7 years
488,1502226753.008092,Bruno,its been a few years already
488,1502226824.04134,Elanor,this in C I need for Pyhton
488,1502226889.072276,Bruno,i have no clue. im not a C guy.
488,1502226927.090913,Tandra,i could guess but i won't
488,1502226995.123211,Orpha,<https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html>; ^ you could always just use the c code
488,1502227160.200731,Beula,"You need to provide more context <@Elanor> , with what you've shown there is next to no context"
488,1502227209.223391,Elanor,"I don't have any headers imported in Python , I only import shared libraries"
488,1502227243.238966,Beula,That's context :wink:
488,1502227243.238976,Elanor,"In C++ the headers name is SDK; I'm calling function from this shared library; The Share Library is already done by another person I Import it in Python and I need to use some function calls; he told me to use extern , but I don't know what that mean in Python"
488,1502227375.300476,Bruno,can you point to the source of the library so we know what sdk is?; i think thats what he needs
488,1502227606.405633,Orpha,this sounds like you need to import the .so into python and call a function right?
488,1502227772.484025,Elanor,If I can get the source I will provide it to you
488,1502227868.531182,Beula,<https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>
488,1502227885.538634,Bruno,"well, the name doesnt mean much. we need to know what it does in C in order to do similar in python."
488,1502227934.561674,Beula,"I don't think they are trying to recreate it in Python, I think they want to use the shared lib from python"
488,1502227988.586159,Elanor,No what I'm going to do in Python just Functuon Calls
488,1502229595.289567,Beula,"We did Mesos, so using an orchestration system"
488,1502229608.295668,Bruno,"ah. yea, rancher came to mind too.; i havent touched mesos"
488,1502229684.328742,Beula,"Kubernetes, Mesos, Rancher, Swarm - take your pick :slightly_smiling_face:"
488,1502229697.334118,Bruno,the place im trying to get an interview with i guess is using docker with aws.
488,1502229713.340634,Beula,Everywhere seems to say that these days :wink:
488,1502229733.348875,Bruno,or they want to. or something.; yea

extern Sdk*  Sdk_new2(const char * ip);; what you mean in that?"
489,1502227175.207288,Beula,"Depending on what headers are imported, Sdk could be anything"
489,1502227210.22387,Elanor,.so
489,1502227240.237529,Beula,"Okay, so what shared object libraries?"
489,1502227280.256602,Elanor,in Linxu
489,1502227282.257793,Beula,"Is this python C-extension specific, or something else?"
489,1502227753.475073,Elanor,yes; but the function Name is Sdk_new2; and SDK is the Main class name; in C++
489,1502227867.53076,Beula,Sounds like you could benefit from CFFI; CFFI is the easiest way IIRC
489,1502227965.575659,Elanor,I will take a look
489,1502227967.576917,Bruno,ah yea. i was thinking wrong.; may have gotten lost above. but looking to see how others may be deploying docker on aws. either their container service or beanstalk or something else.

491,1502245565.441689,Steve,should I only ask questions in here if I have them?
491,1502245908.50629,Marcie,"<@Steve> this is typically a place for generic python questions or if there isnt a more specific place to ask your question if it's about a particular library or topic (such as <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, <#C07EYDP25|webdev>, <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning>, etc.)"
491,1502246200.559996,Steve,cool thanks
492,1502256984.926101,Tameika,if you have 3 files as follows : `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py27.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py34.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.so`; How do I link the `libboost_python-py34.so`to `-lboost_python`?
493,1502281757.544801,Lanita,"Hm, how terrible of an idea is it to use classes as a sort of symbol, instead of using an enum?

Something like this:

```

    class State(Symbol): pass
    class FireTheMissiles(State): pass
    class WaitAround(State): pass

493,1502282533.85341,Lanita,"ah, after looking at it, Enum seems like a much better choice; malinoff, having one auto() for every new possible value is really ugly; The syntax is clearly a compromise for python not having proper enums to begin with; maybe something like...

sym FIRE_THE_MISSILES
sym WAIT_AROUND
StateEnum = SymbolCollection(""StateEnum"", FIRE_THE_MISSILES, WAIT_AROUND)

(assuming that this was implemented way earlier, of course). This would allow symbols ""on their own"" as well as a collection of symbols. Perhaps that might as well be a list though, it really depends on how you're using enums to begin with"

502,1502390634.339132,Antionette,I think the main thing is whether or not you would use the migration features of the ORM; but usually that's fairly separate anyway; for instance you should have no problem using sql-alchemy or pony with an existing database; even if you had been using that database with an existing codebase in a different language previously
502,1502390809.438842,Jesusa,hmmm; I have never done a migration and I always fear it; I always prefer to just delete the database; :confused:; it's a scary habit when something I make would hit production; I'd have no experience doing a migration
502,1502390880.480934,Beula,<@Jesusa> I have CI always run all migrations to make sure they are compatible
502,1502390916.501982,Jesusa,like just simply changing an existing column name or something
502,1502390978.538053,Beula,"You can use a number of technologies to do it, liquibase (java based), flyway (java based), alembic (python based), django ORM; <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/blob/2bca4b29be32f51cd4c8b7663d757670be9cde65/.travis.yml#L18>"

504,1502389669.769898,Antionette,for example in mysql if the table is already created you could use (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-index.html>) and if you are making the table then with the unique constraint (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table.html>)

505,1502398057.399837,Beula,What have you tried <@Tameika> ? You can get pretty close without deleting any files to prove out your idea!

505,1502399253.037814,Leonie,"if you want to find files matching a wildcard in Python, you could use the glob module. ```for path in glob.glob('foo_bar_cat_*_dog'):

511,1502440378.156456,Gertude,Is there something built in pycharm that builds requirements.txt for pip? Also how do I call pip install requirements from within my code?

I never used microsoft windows so I don't know how my code would run there..
511,1502440455.181355,Carri,windows installations of python includes `pip` these days by default; You can use Inno Setup to create an exe installer for windows <http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>
511,1502440594.225361,Gertude,Thank you <@Carri>; What about pycharm and `pip` Requirements.txt?
511,1502440872.31471,Carri,<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-requirement-files.html>
512,1502444128.386786,Meg,or use the command line `pip freeze &gt; /path/to/requirements.txt`
512,1502444847.620859,Collette,"Ideally `requirements.txt` should be populated manually, using top-level requirements such as `django`, `requests` and `djangorestframework`. After you have all of that in place, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` once. Then do `pip freeze &gt; requirements.lock.txt`; Then always use `requirements.lock.txt` to install dependencies"
512,1502444940.650243,Junita,"I do a `<http://requirements.in|requirements.in>` where I just list the requirements without versions, then `pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt <http://requirements.in|requirements.in>`; and that maintains the exact versions."
512,1502444956.655465,Collette,"Or that, yes, using `pip-compile` flow"
512,1502444966.65873,Junita,"i then use a service called PyUp I think it is to submit PRs when my stuff needs to be updated.; It’s a pretty nice workflow, but yup, just one of a couple possibilities"
512,1502444996.668108,Collette,"But `requirements.txt` contains not only exact versions of dependencies, but exact versions of dependencies' dependencies"
512,1502445015.674262,Junita,oh right good point
512,1502445016.674772,Collette,"That's the point of having two different requirements files; In that case, the file with exact versions is often called a ""lock"" file"
512,1502445066.690998,Junita,"a nice thing about the `pip-compile` (not sure if others offer this as well) is it adds comments about where the dependencies come from; yeah I guess that’s a good point, it might be better to use that naming scheme"
512,1502445160.720942,Collette,"&gt; it might be better to use that naming scheme
Unless there's a tool that requires a specific naming, like `pbr` which expects `requirements.txt` file in the root of the repository; (I personally don't like it, I'd rather have a way to explicitly specify the path to requirements in the `setup.cfg`, but I've managed to overcome this by symlinking `requirements/runtime.txt` to `requirements.txt`)"

529,1502729843.868328,Beverley,"it's a simple issue though, the rendered image has pixels offset seen on the image; <@Meg> you'll see there's a grayscale image above the one in full color, it shouldn't have the lines and I believe it's because of the way I create and edit positions in javascript then render it in PIL that's bringing black boxes lines"
529,1502730587.291938,Ciera,I would use nested `with`; maybe as ugly but more readable imo
529,1502730618.309243,Sade,i figured i must be missing some better option
529,1502730656.330034,Ciera,you can look at `contexlib.Exitstack`; but if you only have two it might not be worth it; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>
529,1502730794.40476,Sade,that does look promising although it looks like i’ll have to depend on the python2 backport
529,1502730796.406102,Beula,"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>; Oh, that's 3.3"
529,1502730833.42578,Ciera,<@Beula> :face_with_rolling_eyes:
529,1502730848.434072,Beula,"Oh, wow; yep - my slack client didn't refresh yet; <@Ciera> :taco:"
529,1502730869.44645,Sade,mmm that might work.  i’m not that accustomed to using the patch decorators so i didn’t think of it :slightly_smiling_face:
529,1502730888.45656,Ciera,haha yeah it happens sometimes :pacman:
529,1502730909.46882,Beula,"I use it for 2 levels or more, primarily because flat is generally better than nested"
529,1502730954.494544,Cherly,"One disadvantage of this usage, is that mocked method will be patched for all test function, but this leads to make them smaller ==&gt; smaller unit test"
529,1502730968.502359,Ciera,I agree but for only two levels it might make things a bit too complex
529,1502730995.517336,Sade,yeah that seems like an advantage :slightly_smiling_face:
529,1502731006.523883,Ciera,I like when you have multiple nested context managers with `if` for the one you want to enter
530,1502730337.15539,Meg,"not sure, what are you looking for?"
531,1502730532.261927,Sade,"hello there, style question:
```
    with patch(""core.http.requests.request"") as mocked_request, \
         patch(""core.http.time.sleep"") as mocked_sleep:
```
what’s the best way to avoid using a line continuation there?; i can only think to use nested `with` statements which seems similarly ugly; if those are the only two choices i would definitely go with the next `with`, anyway :slightly_smiling_face:"
531,1502730775.394934,Cherly,Why not set patch as decorator to test function?
531,1502730778.39638,Beula,I would use `contextlib.ExitStack`
532,1502764959.000084,Hermina,"Hi folks, It might a bit unrelated here. But i’m trying to use an api from other service. They give apikey, password, shared secret. apikey and password alone can help me get access to the api. So why we need an shared secret. I’m working with shopify api. Thanks!"
532,1502765033.000004,Beula,<@Hermina> - Usually when they give something like a shared secret it's either so your application can validate incoming requests (aka webhooks) or you can sign a payload before sending it to them (so they can validate similarly)
532,1502765428.000107,Hermina,thanks. Google got a bunch of crypto info but not helped :slightly_smiling_face:. It clearer for me now

534,1502789459.000101,Meredith,hi anyone here have experience with react native

534,1502789515.000259,Meredith,i can't get a way to handle csrftoken from the cookies
534,1502793442.000099,Suellen,"<@Georgetta>

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dict(data))
{'two': 2, 'one': 1, 'three': 3}
```; not the best demonstration of order, but the idea is to convert it to a normal dict; you lose the benefit of Ordering, but depending on why you need to print it - you might not need it"
535,1502793533.000026,Collette,Or use python 3.6+ :slightly_smiling_face:
536,1502805331.000131,Ok,"Hi All, am trying to trigger a python script using jenkins.. am not able to understand where am going wrong but the build is not getting successful or failure.. it was just keeping on blinking the blue ball saying build in progress.. i kept waiting hours but no response.. where the script am able to execute from command prompt.. having anyone faced kind of problem or any suggestions would be appreciated "
536,1502805477.000184,Collette,<@Ok> show us your script
536,1502805581.000148,Beula,And how you're calling it. Be sure to add logging to your script to know when/where it hangs (sounds like it's in a queue and never gets to an executor)
536,1502805623.000187,Ok,U mean python script <@Collette> 
536,1502805631.000263,Collette,Yep
536,1502805659.000433,Ok,I will try it <@Beula> but am able to execute other python scripts in jenkins
536,1502805669.000319,Collette,<@Beula> more like the python script is waiting for some input
536,1502805683.00033,Beula,Or that
536,1502805712.000161,Ok,Sorry <@Collette>  its too big script.. ; But its a unit testing kind off
536,1502805748.000352,Collette,"<@Ok> click on the plus sign to the left from the slack input field, and choose ""Add code or text snippet"""
536,1502805790.000491,Ok,<@Collette> its actually from my office server so i can take that script out
536,1502805812.000293,Collette,What?
536,1502805842.000258,Ok,Is cant take that script out to here
536,1502805861.000375,Beula,"In that case, you need to add logging to find where in the script the execution gets to - but beyond that I am not sure we can do much"
536,1502805920.00042,Ok,I will try as u said <@Beula> by logging to script
536,1502805956.000084,Beula,"It's a pretty common way to debug, it should often be one of your first actions when you hit an issue"
536,1502806047.000296,Ciera,first question is. does the scrip try to run ?
536,1502806057.000247,Ok,Yeah since am just new to this world of python and Jenkins thing learning <@Beula> 
536,1502806073.000451,Beula,Then add logging/print statements pretty judiciously :slightly_smiling_face:
536,1502806134.000421,Ok,"Script is trying to run, it not throwing any error but just running <@Ciera> "
536,1502806203.000203,Beula,"As <@Collette> mentioned, are you waiting for an `input` (or `raw_input` in py2) in the code? Any `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`? etc"
536,1502806228.000314,Collette,Or contains an infinite loop
536,1502806272.000118,Ok,No there is no input needed.. as i said its running fine in command prompt without error; Only when i integrate in Jenkins causing this error
536,1502806312.00014,Collette,<@Ok> do you have *any* output?
536,1502806329.000293,Ok,Yeah the out should be an html file
537,1502807497.000345,Meghan,"Speaking of logging. Is there a good best practice article on how to configure it? I'm getting double messages, but have been too busy dealing with functionality to try to figure out where I went wrong."
537,1502807807.000286,Beula,<@Meghan> You probably just have `propagate` set to true: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate> That will have anything handled by a nested logger bubble up to the ancestors
537,1502808045.000628,Meghan,"Thanks, I'll take a look."
538,1502810175.000685,Juli,Hi Everyone Really need your <#C07EFMZ1N|help> I have deadline coming up for my project demo So can anyone provide with some knowledge on how to go on to build these interactive message buttons for a bot response in slack?; I am using Python for my development
538,1502810258.000056,Beula,"<@Juli> You usually get the best responses here when you have *specific* questions, where are you actually stuck?"
538,1502810512.00004,Juli,Yes so what I have till now is a bot in slack that uses Slackclient/RTM API/Flask for fetching a message in real time from a channel and only if it has certain keywords in the message then the bot responds with a ok message for now!; But what I want to do know is instead of replying with an ok message reply with these interactive message that does some particular action based on the button the user selects; But I am firstly not able to find a good documentation or a step by step guide for going with building this in python; So if anyone can provide me with a good tutorial or documenation or can point me to the right resource for building these in python then it would be a great help! Thanks !
538,1502810928.000242,Beula,Are you new to Python and http?
538,1502811187.000405,Juli,"Not new to python can write code with python and dealing with data, pandas, os, sys, functions, lists, etc! But not great with web and python so yes struggling with http and web related stuff!"
538,1502811290.000015,Beula,"I am just trying to gauge what kind of resources to send over, have you started with <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments> ?; calling <@Ciera> - is your sansio lib ready for prime time?"
538,1502811495.000264,Ciera,no not yet :confused:
538,1502811850.000024,Juli,Yes <@Beula> I was reading through these yesterday but due to time constraints I was looking for something more narrower that gives an example of how to build one of these with python; There are examples of how to build one with node
538,1502811925.000035,Johana,doesn’t sirbot currently do this?
538,1502811950.000424,Beula,Yeah; But that's asyncio based - I wasn't sure if it would be a confusing resource
538,1502811978.000304,Juli,But I have not worked with node and was not finding a good documentation with python
538,1502811985.000023,Johana,<@Juli> go take a look at the sirbot source code.. it might be async but the process between your app and slack should be similar.
538,1502812002.000247,Beula,Let me find a direct link
538,1502812039.000132,Johana,yea that will probably be easier.
538,1502812047.000271,Beula,"hmm, well there is the giphy code... but not the router for the events; <@Ciera> - can you point a good link for responding to message buttons from the sirbot repos?"
538,1502812110.000339,Juli,Thanks will have a look! That would be very helpful
538,1502812183.000169,Johana,yea i haven’t had time to continue the bot tutorial but i’ve noted slack buttons :wink:.
538,1502812262.000406,Ciera,<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-slack/blob/master/sirbot/slack/dispatcher/action.py#L34>; this is the coroutine that handle incoming `action`; like press on a button; it is then routed based on the `callback_id`; for giphy it is routed to this:<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/pythondev/slack.py#L341>
538,1502812409.000321,Beula,<@Ciera> :taco:
538,1502812426.000078,Juli,<@Johana> that would be an awesome tutorial! Also I don't think there are many available already. Hopefully even I can contribute to it in a while
538,1502812440.000065,Ciera,you can then respond with a new message or update the original
538,1502812455.000094,Juli,Thanks <@Ciera> Will look into these; Thanks <@Beula> and <@Johana> as well! Really appreciate that!
538,1502820972.000215,Johana,yea i used that originally for the bot_tutorial but i had to hack it too much to get it to run in a jupyter notebook.
539,1502819848.000494,Meghan,"I'm late to this, but this library makes working with Slack easy: <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot> <@Juli>"
540,1502821039.000072,Johana,it expects a settings.py file in the root of the dir which is a little outdated nowadays.; if anything the config should look for it and offer another method or use env vars.
540,1502821104.000326,Meghan,"For the bot I wrote with it I did have to go around one of the recommended methods with the decorator and grab the data dictionary. But, otherwise worked fine.; Environment variables are an option.; I agree with the settings.py though, that part should be fixed."

540,1502821171.000406,Johana,oh i guess it does have it.. opened my mouth again.; lol; still kinda not a fan of what was done there.
540,1502821404.000394,Meghan,"I wrote a bot with it that may be fun, after a discussion in here on Friday. A bot that executes python code from the chat if the tag is included. Of course, it will need a lot of safety checks before it runs the code."
540,1502821811.000196,Johana,"<@Meghan>, <@Beula> mentioned having some code that does that. it will setup a docker container and execute. perhaps something like that would work for you. i’m thinking the benefits are you can remove networking, volumes, etc."
540,1502821830.000403,Beula,"yeah, I should pull that code out of the other project; Can you define ""BBD""?"
540,1502823095.000535,Bronwyn,lol; BDD; had to quick scroll away from that link
540,1502823209.000043,Ciera,ah sorry
540,1502823210.000491,Winnifred,Lol

540,1502823295.000013,Bronwyn,saw a bunch of libs but most dont look like they have much of a community
540,1502823702.000052,Beula,"BDD doesn't seem to be huge in python, the only place I have seen it really big is node and ruby"

544,1502870004.000165,Kiersten,<@Jeanette> I use django-debug-toolbar for debugging any django app

544,1502870479.00016,Collette,"<@Florene> easy suggestion: run it in foreground; Or use a remote debugger, for example <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/remote-pdb/>"
544,1502870532.00038,Florene,that is not possible for the service which i want to debug; would remote-pdb work for Containers too?
544,1502870577.000322,Collette,Yes. Just make sure you have its port published to the host

will try it
thanks <@Collette> :slightly_smiling_face:; Hi guys

546,1502873170.000324,Gisela,"Hey guys. Newbie here! (just posted in the introduction channel!)
I'm building my first web app where the user logs in using his twitch account. I implemented python social auth for django (<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django> ) and it works fine.

Now I want to add custom attributes to the SocialAuthUser model. I want to get the values for these attributes from the user's social account (twitch), so I'm gonna do a get request to twitch API using the access token I got on login/registration.
My question is, how do I extend the SocialAuthUser model and add the get request to twitch in the pipeline? 
more specifically:
1. How do I add custom fields to the SocialAuthUser model
2. In what .py file and in what class, method or function do I do the get request to get the data to populate the custom fields? 

Hope the question makes sense. :slightly_smiling_face: 
Thanks!"
546,1502873317.000419,Ciera,Hi <@Gisela> we have a dedicated <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel. Question regarding <#C0LMFRMB5|django> should go there :slightly_smiling_face:
547,1502875395.00031,Lanita,"For a string `s`, is there something equivalent to the POSIX tool tr's `tr -s ""  "" "" ""`?

SPACE = "" ""
while 2*SPACE in s:
    s = s.replace(2*SPACE, SPACE)
```
is OK for my use cases I guess, though re-creating strings all the times is slow"
547,1502875556.0001,Ciera,you shouldn't need a while loop
547,1502875606.00024,Vada,`s = ' '.join(part for part in s.split(' ') if part)` should work; <@Lanita> ^^
547,1502876038.000104,Desire,Please recommend me some good resources on `Design Patterns with Python`
547,1502876117.000256,Vada,"the coding blocks podcast has done a series on design patterns - mainly specific to C#, VB and Java, but a lot of it still applies"

547,1502876224.000156,Vada,Yeah that works - although I tend to avoid regex; I tend to listen to them on commutes or when I'm at the gym; or washingup/cooking; times when I'm doing something manual and can't actively use my brain

Thank you"

550,1502897193.000668,Assunta,"on how it work together, Imean the concept or architecture. because I don’t have yet experience in Python, and my team whole department is planning to move to python; for instance is that possible to use apache spark with django with python. and if that possible to rid the cron and just use rest api using python; I am quite straggle on how I can align my team for this. and we have facing problem with PHP which is not valuable for big data analytics"
550,1502897461.0003,Beula,I'm not sure the tech from the client to the database matters here - normally with spark wouldn't you stream off a read-replica and process the data?

I'm doing image recognition, and I've seen in different examples that I have to use `tf.gfile.FastGFile(image_path, 'rb').read()` as my image data.

552,1502930857.000187,Meg,"check whether that tensorflow method takes in a file like object; if so, you can create a temp file, read the image into memory and pass it in"

I think if we have 4 core, we can create 4 processes with might better than 4 threads using one process right? I’m writing script to migrate data from db postgres to other db (elasticsearch)"
553,1502940178.000163,Johana,is what you have currently going super slow?

553,1502940244.000144,Beula,"In python we have the gil, which only lets a single thread run at a time. Given that, the only way threads help you in python is io bound things (waiting on network requests). Processes help for cpu bound work, but sharing data is expensive as it makes entire copies to share (since memory space isn't shared in python)."
553,1502940260.000074,Johana,i’ve never filled elastic search with tons of data but i have done so with postgres. typically in these situations you gotta be careful about your database sessions and want to use a connection pool.
553,1502940346.00006,Beula,"Agreed, I'm not sure how much perf you can really squeze out of a database migration (but since it should be 1 time, that's probably ok "
553,1502940395.000073,Johana,"yea… i agree there sometimes its ok to ensure all the data goes in properly.; i know i’ve done well over 10,000 transactions a second with postgresql. i’m not sure about elastic search."

555,1502961265.000026,Lanita,"If we want to build a dictionary like this:
```
d = {
    ""hello"": world,

Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?


I very often find myself repeating this pattern:


```
d = { ""some_preknown_key"": ""some_preknown_value"", }
if cond1:
    d[cond1_key] = cond1_value
    
if cond2:

```
d = cond_build_dict({
    ""some_preknown_key"": some_preknown_value"",
    when(cond1, cond1_key, cond1_value),
    when(cond2, cond2_key, cond2_value),
})
```

which would return a regular dict, with the `cond1_key` and `cond2_key` keys only
present if the first argument of their respective `when` function call is `True`.; when could return the equivalent of `cond1_key : cond1_value`  if the first argument is True, else puts some key: value token of some kind that will be filtered out by cond_build_dict (which is a function that takes a dict and remove all keys containing this token)"
555,1502961507.000337,Suellen,"&gt; Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?
Kinda.; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def conditional_data():
...     if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
...         return {'condition_is_met': '1234'}

... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'hello': 'world', **conditional_data()}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'hello': 'world'}

{'hello': 'world'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'hello': 'world', **conditional_data()}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'hello': 'world', 'condition_is_met': '1234'}
```; so your original example can be written like this:
```
d = {
    ""hello"": world,
    **f(),
}
```"
555,1502961556.00003,Lanita,"<@Suellen> yup, that's how I've been doing before; but I'd like to have everything be in one place, to make it visually easier to parse; since it looks and feels more declerative; one built-in option that works if you're okay with keeping the key is simply doing
```
d = {
   ""some_key"": some_value if cond else None

555,1502961698.000242,Gabriele,Personally I like the explicit `if` statements. If the dict really does have a variety of different permutations I like that to be explicit in the code
555,1502961742.00006,Lanita,"short, declarative code in one place is typically easier to read than slowly mutating an object to get to where we want to be"

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(**user_data() if store_user else {})

559,1502986807.000274,Juli,Because in this blog also the author said it did'nt work for her without authentication so i thought its necessary <https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8>; Yaa I got that but then do I not have to write a code to handle those parameters/tokens in the request/response to that Url?; Or is it done by itself?
559,1502987115.000655,Ciera,for action I don't think you need to perform any authentification on your side; you can check with the verification token if the request is coming from slack but it's not mandatory
559,1502987259.000407,Juli,I think this is the part where I am stucked/not able to understand properly. Any python/flask example to handle request response to these request URL without Oauth?; I went to <@Alesia> but still not able to understand it from there
559,1502987489.000526,Chantell,where is the best book about design patterns and algorithms (in python?)
559,1502987539.000479,Ciera,you need to put an url in the interactive message setting and have a flask app listening on this url; and you should be good
559,1502987555.000203,Gabriele,"<@Chantell>  To be honest, I don't find design patterns are as important in Python as they are in Java or C++. A lot of the big problems that the traditional design patterns solve don't really exist to the same degree with Python"
559,1502987556.000418,Ciera,I don't really have a python example on hand :confused:
559,1502987629.000029,Gabriele,"<@Chantell> The Python Cookbook used to be a good collection of algorithms and snippets, but I've not read the Python 3 edition"
559,1502987655.000445,Liberty,and it has some design pattern implentations there
559,1502987705.000266,Chantell,okay.. I own an older edition of the python cookbook..  I was looking at it last night.. Maybe I just need to buy the new one.; o gosh.. the older edition i have from 2013  is the newest one.  Okay
559,1502987905.000356,Liberty,"oh…just remembered there is <https://github.com/faif/python-patterns>

559,1502987934.000005,Chantell,yeah.. this is mostly to advance my perspective.. not for a specific work project.

559,1502988004.000663,Ciera,post only I think. Not sure; should be in the doc
559,1502988031.000052,Juli,So I already try with post; let me try it again

There is some code that is shared between them that I want to pull of into its own project.  What is the most common way of managing dependencies between projects/repos?   This is not code that I can upload to pypy."
562,1503000956.000061,Meghan,You can still pip install it without using pypi.
562,1503000994.000311,Gustavo,so a virtual env for each project and then pip install the other projects for them?
562,1503001006.00037,Meghan,"If they are libraries, yeah.; You can even pip install it as development, so it won't be copied to site-packages."
562,1503001046.000415,Gustavo,right now they are just packages
562,1503001068.000302,Meghan,"Yeah, probably just pip install each library as a development.; At least for people who are working on the code rather than just using it.; from pip install

563,1503021502.000011,Jeanett,"hello
I am totally new to python, I just installed it now on my windows 8.1 system
when i went to my git bash and ran ""python -v"" it gave off a kind of a long list of gibberish rather than the version of python"
563,1503021680.000028,Marcie,"<@Jeanett> lowercase `-v` is ""verbose"", capital `-V` is version"
563,1503021757.000147,Jeanett,:grinning:; It worked. thanks mate
564,1503027277.000192,Margaretta,help with code; `code`; i get this error
564,1503028493.000051,Marcie,<@Margaretta> the `set` object in python doesn't support indexing because they're unordered collections of items; as soon as you convert a list to a set you lose the ordering of any items inside; you can optionally cast back to a list and then sort again; `topdata = sorted(list(data))[0:3]`
565,1503034325.00011,Margaretta,<@Marcie> :taco:; <@Marcie>  - This works; `data=sorted(set([sanitize(t) for t in data]))`
565,1503034441.000047,Marcie,oh nice; passing a set to sorted directly is definitely gonna come in handy for some code golf
566,1503030289.000049,Latrina,"tl;dr I want to create multiple record of a Model based on a variable which sits pn the webpage(fron-end); i would request you all , if you have a look to my problem. I need some advice with that ^^"
567,1503036083.000158,Marcie,<@Latrina> what's stopping you from just creating three instances?
567,1503036222.000139,Latrina,"its not only 3 , it depends , For example : If anyone wants to add 6 items, then they will add the items on the frontend variable(var item= 6) ,now  its 6 items; so the no of forms to be generated  depends on the value of a variable in Javascript; <@Marcie>  do i have to use a for loop for this or is there any other way ?"
567,1503036465.000145,Marcie,a for loop is fine if you need X instances of something to be created
567,1503036597.000028,Latrina,so in this case i have to pass the Js variable value(let's say n) to my function which will set the forloop to n.; i was researching on this and found formsets(extras=some value); can i use form sets in my use case?; Anyone ??
567,1503055941.000035,Marcie,"<@Latrina> sorry, i'm not too familiar with formsets, that's a good question for <#C0LMFRMB5|django> though"
568,1503055273.000023,Jeanette,Anyone stumbled upon something like this?
568,1503056467.000043,Rufus,"<@Jeanette> looks like either `parent_url_path` or `slug` are `None`, can you post more of your code that's causing this error?; oh ok, sorry, I didn't realise the exception was coming from library code; either the `wagtail_modeltranslation` package is broken, or it's expecting your model or some other part of your code to behave differently to how it actually is; oh good heavens, they're dynamically attaching methods to classes"
568,1503057144.000088,Jeanette,yes and based on the language that is chosen you get the translated field
568,1503057233.000082,Rufus,"just makes it a lot harder to figure out what's going on without actually attaching a debugger to your code, that's all; maybe file an issue with `wagtail_modeltranslation`? search around first to see if someone else already has, though"
568,1503057351.000203,Jeanette,yep that is true; It's been a couple of hours now ...; Why is it trying to reach the en version? I don't get it; tried: ['en/((?:[\\w\\-]+/)*)$']
568,1503057891.00013,Meg,"I think at this point, you need to attach a debugger and put a breakpoint on that line in wagtail_modeltranslation/patch_wagtailadmin.py; Because that's a wagtail issue, and if it's not reported, then the debugger can help"
568,1503058118.000034,Jeanette,"thanks I didn't think about that; just fyi the regex is matching the english version because of the i18n_patterns in settings.py urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    url(r'', include(wagtail_urls)),
)"
569,1503064324.000244,Lanita,"I have a package that I'm developing. I want to use the package inside of a virtualenv and install it with something like pip... but that's not possible unless I create a setup.py, right? Since pip only works with setup.py?
Setup:
```
mypackage/
    mymodule/
        __init__.py
testcode.py
requirements.txt
```
I can import the function defined in __init__.py to testcode.py by creating a virtualenv then symlinking the `mypackage` folder to my virtualenv"
569,1503064394.00031,Liberty,you can create setup.py and call it directly
569,1503064405.000604,Ciera,exactly. There is some tools that ease that. I heard some good things about Flit but never used it myself; <http://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
569,1503064435.000196,Lanita,I was just thinking that it's be nice to not have to manually symlink or write the setup.py (until it's needed later for packaging purposes)
569,1503064455.000562,Ciera,you can also install your package with the `-e` flags for pip; that allow you to edit the code in place without needing to reinstall each time
569,1503064495.00007,Lanita,"yeah, but I still need a setup.py for that?"
569,1503064501.00034,Ciera,`pip install -e .`; yes
569,1503064596.000123,Lanita,"Hm, I guess I'll just manually symlink to my venv's lib/python3.5/site-packages folder until I've written a setup.py file; Since it's symlinked I can edit the code in place just fine"
569,1503064995.000372,Ciera,you might want to take a look at the tool I linked :point_up: it does almost everything for you for the setup.py
569,1503065335.000353,Lanita,"looking at it, it seems like a way to generate the setup.py and upload it to pypi. But I'm not sure how it helps if I'm not uploading it to pypi"
569,1503065425.000005,Ciera,well generate the setup.py :smile:
569,1503065436.000452,Lanita,"I suppose, but through another, new sytnax; syntax; by the way, I haven't heard much about alternatives to pypi... is there a way to create a custom repository like pypi, or do people usually just install from git repos? (Which pip support); I suppose there's little reason to create a custom pypi repo when serving things from a git repo is simple enough"
569,1503065953.000115,Ciera,usually from git or pypi; there is also <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi> if you want your own pypi; and <https://pypi.org/> that is in the process of replacing PyPi

574,1503112854.000043,Daryl,"Hi all, I am having an issue with sorting nested OrderedDicts..

I  am trying to sort both the outermost dictionary, and the following dictionary by a key value in the innermost dictionary.

Given the attached snippet, this what I am trying to accomplish:

- For all foods, order the food subtypes by highest calorie content (i.e - For Pizza, Pesto should appear first because it has higher calories when compared to cheese.
- Order all foods by highest calorie content (i.e - Pizza should appear first as it has a subtype with more calories than any other food); Before I tacked on the outermost dictionary, I was using this to sort just the food types (red,green,pesto,cheese):   `OrderedDict(sorted(d.iteritems(), key=lambda x: x[1].iteritems()))` .  However, I am not sure how to proceed after having tacked on the outermost dictionary.; Right, I'd like to make the structure into an OrderedDict. Can you point me in the right direction?"
575,1503114427.000047,Levi,"The problem is then how to cast this as an OrderedDict?; If that is the issue, then I can think of many non-pythonic approaches.; why don't you try sorting the 2 groups separately, casting them into OrderedDict type as above. I ran your code and you are sorting operation is just making it alphabetical, ignoring the inner loops; sort Pizza, sort Apple, find Max of the two, append in order.; if you do the following `for item in d.iteritems(): print(type(item))` you will get `&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;`. You then have to unpack it accordingly making note of where your value pops out.; now, if there is a less convoluted way to do this, I am all for it.; the downside to this is that your sorting has to be via if/then type args inside each top level tuple. If there are more than two food subgroups, then you might call sort in the inner loop"

581,1503162978.000077,Prudence,"Hello. I need help with tensorflow. I have a bottle server that sends an image to a tensorflow script which categorizes the image; After I send images around 5 or 10 times, it starts slowing down. The performance decreases a lot. The first time, the script runs in 1 second, and by the fifth or tenth time, it takes almost more than one minute.; This is the code that I use to categorize the images using tensorflow; And that is the code that I use to run the server; This is the line that slows down after many images: `predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data})`; How can I improve performance?"

581,1503164021.000011,Meg,its a code smell; only import modules in a function if you really need it locally and it costs alot to import

581,1503166248.000026,Meg,"eg, bottle/flask dev server; ok, so are you using a dev server for this or guicorn/wsgi?"
582,1503166270.000034,Prudence,I'm using bottle
582,1503166334.000034,Meg,"yes; but the dev server, eg command line start utility, or nginx/apache with gunicorn/wsgi?; becuase if this is on your local machine with zero prduction configuration, its either your machine or a memory leak"

583,1503170375.000001,Meg,"no, it shouldn’t; but would be interesting if you can run this code standalone with an image; take the web server out of the equation and test with just tensorflow; would give clues to which direction you should go into"

591,1503269696.000025,Mariano,On the `__init__` you are handling the exception by just printing it. That will cause that when there is a connection problem your script will just print the error and continue. I think that's not what you want; Don't catch exceptions for just printing; unless you are doing something with value with it. Dont do it.

So i have used remote_pdb like below:

in code, i have added below at the place where i want debugger prompt:

```
        from remote_pdb import RemotePdb
        RemotePdb('127.0.0.1', 4444).set_trace()
```

In my container, there are *5 processes Running* 
and
One of the process is where i have added above snippet to enable remote-pdb.

After running this, i am able to get following message in my logfile, which means the remote pdb is been used and executed.

603,1503348158.000284,Bruno,"what ways would you guys automate adding new users at a company, to remote servers? the most open way i can think of is just a simple bash script for setting up a users local environment, to also add their user/key to a remote server."
604,1503348195.000293,Ciera,ansible ?
604,1503348293.000158,Bruno,yea. we use salt stack at work so i was looking into that too.
604,1503348381.000424,Beula,"I like making them set it up following a guide, myself. Then they actually know what's up"
604,1503348383.000604,Bruno,i already have a bash script made to do the process. part of the process of me moving to ops at work. i think for normal stuff though a bash script is probably going to be my best bet.
604,1503348401.000192,Beula,Then have them enter their stuff in a web-form or whatever for the remote server
604,1503348405.000407,Bruno,yea. they want to make it all automated.; i just ask questions with bash `read` on the cli
604,1503348438.000028,Beula,They are shooting themselves in the foot if the people who know how things really work leave - but aight
604,1503348509.000249,Bruno,"well to be fair, most of the devs dont need to ssh into remote servers. we do use vagrant for local dev. we do have a guide for getting into those and debugging; we can already deploy testing setups based on the current app that are short lived anyways (default 24hrs). mostly just for testing; and we dont allow people into normal staging/prod"
604,1503348647.000424,Johana,what about LDAP?
604,1503348663.000175,Bruno,we dont have an ldap server
604,1503348671.000317,Johana,that’s what i mean. set one up.
604,1503348678.000261,Bruno,would be another way too though.
604,1503348702.00002,Johana,that’s probably more long term.; i’ve had to use a number of approaches at different jobs. the most simple i can think of atm is ansible but saltstack can do the same.
604,1503348848.000254,Bruno,ive never set one up? are they hard?
604,1503348869.000304,Johana,i’ve only setup windows AD before.
604,1503348874.000197,Bruno,ah
604,1503348886.000013,Johana,i should set one up. they can be useful for businesses and all sorts of applications.
604,1503348896.000064,Bruno,im not sure we would need that though. since devs are limited to what they can ssh into remotely anwyas
604,1503349055.000419,Johana,if you are already using saltstack just use that.
604,1503349096.000144,Bruno,yea. that was my thought. i was just trying to think if there was any other methods i should consider or make an example for.
604,1503349168.000508,Johana,"yea, onboarding is always one of those “stop and see how to do this better” things."
604,1503349184.000338,Bruno,im wondering if i should even make an example for that. since i dont think its something we will be using anyways.; our onboarding setup is already pretty good. vagrant and opendns to provide accecss to staging servers.

610,1503413573.000278,Meg,"closed captioning, subtitles; I'm deaf and wear hearing aids; so, while I can hear just about everything in my hearing range (have pretty significant high frequency loss), there's a large gulf between _hearing_ and _understanding_; so, I use lip reading alot to understand speech"

610,1503413668.000152,Meg,"so, for me... if we were talking face to face in English, I wouldn't have any trouble conversing with you.  but if you were to rotate so your back was to me, you'd go from speaking English to Russian.. and I don't speak Russian; lip reading helps me to put values to a series of sounds of speech to understand; and autocaptions have come a long way, and the ones for conference presentations are very good"
610,1503413731.000216,Ciera,yes
610,1503413742.000118,Meg,"but there's a big difference in that quality and what you see in movies, TV and live programs; and that's mainly due to quality of the audio, as well as placement of the microphone; with speech, the closer the microphone, the better."
610,1503414102.000167,Thomasina,"Oh, yes. Actually I have a lot of interest in developing accessibility-related products (primarily for their function and not so much for profit). It's good to hear that - at least for some videos - auto-captioning has gone from laughable to actually helpful. There are so many ways that technology can be used to aid those with various circumstances and conditions, and even those I _think_ it has improved somewhat, I feel like the entire field could use a lot more attention and work."
610,1503414150.00058,Meg,"there actually is alot of work going on now; in fact, microsoft research has shown that their auto transcription error rate is lower than that of professional transcriptionists; <https://qz.com/812317/microsoft-msft-claims-its-speech-transcription-ai-is-now-better-than-human-professionals/>; but again, the primary differentator is quality of the audio combined with background noise"

While (as far as I know) my hearing is alright, even I would appreciate automatic, perfect transcriptions.

612,1503424245.000344,Meg,"well, you can google it yourself and find a number of resources.; but the gist of it is like googlebot crawling websites for indexing; <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>"

612,1503425286.000376,Meg,"actually, you do; because selenium needs something to actually render the page; typically, chromedriver, phantomdriver, etc"
612,1503425322.000301,Ramona,"You're right about that, when I said you don't need a headless browser, I meant you can just use your regular browser"
612,1503425328.000383,Meg,"ah, ok :slightly_smiling_face:; yup, true; but that's also more time-consuming, and not quite what I think <@Bernita> wants in this case"
612,1503425440.000259,Ramona,"I never used the headless chrome, but it looks like it's already capable of creating a simple dump without any other tools! That's actually pretty cool"
612,1503425497.000407,Meg,"yep.  Originally, you had to go through quite a few steps to do it, and so phantom was usually the option of choice; but now that google's made headless chrome much easier to use in testing, usage rates are going up; which makes sense; <http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/>; take alook at the server/runtime part; PJS is PhantomJS, and its pretty incompatible with ES6"
612,1503425577.000368,Ramona,"Since when does it exist? I remember looking for a headless browser last year, but couldn't find anything useful except for phantomjs"
612,1503425604.000407,Meg,"but given that there was only one dev/maintainer, even getting to the feature level it did is a great accomplishment; <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>; its available on linux and osx as of chrome 59, windows as of chrome 60"

    RegistrationNumber = CarBrand = Description = str
    def f(...) -&gt; Dict[RegistrationNumber, Dict[CarBrand, Description]]:
```

Or perhaps something more... GraphQL-y perhaps? Something like

```
{
    reg_number: str {
        car_brand: str = description: str
    }
}
```

This would also give us a recommended variable name for each variable,
which is worthwhile if we want other functions calling this functions
to interact with the dict using the same name."
631,1503566711.000137,Suellen,"<@Merlin> can you try `UUID_TO_BIN`?; `UPDATE tbl SET id = UUID_TO_BIN('6ccd780c-baba-1026-9564-5b8c656024db');`; <@Lanita>
`RegistrationNumber = CarBrand = Description = str`; I feed violated"
631,1503566830.000107,Lanita,<@Suellen> I didn't choose to let str work as both a type annotation and a function :slightly_smiling_face:
631,1503566867.000242,Suellen,Is a docstring on your function not enough?
631,1503566873.000391,Lanita,"yes; but I'm wondering what's the best way to write it; that's most readable; Right now I'm using the first function annotation (with aliases), and the docstring also contains an example of actual data; *without aliases I mean; e.g. no RegistrationNumber... stuff"
631,1503567003.000357,Suellen,I doubt that a good docstring is not enough; you can try showing your function (or only definition) to somebody and let them guess what it does
631,1503567028.00017,Lanita,"Yes, but then how would you write the docstring?; as in, actual ""syntax""; Describing it in words is super verbose and hard to understand; especially with dicts, I've never found a good syntax I like for describing what the key and value represents that isn't overly verbose"
631,1503567070.000294,Suellen,that's one of the hardest things in computer science :slightly_smiling_face:
631,1503567153.000205,Lanita,When I'm sketching out stuff on my own I usually use some type of Hindley–Milner with an Haskell-like syntax for describing these things; but then I convert it to python's typing module annotations (e.g. valid python code/syntax)

```"
631,1503567278.000075,Lanita,"The problem is that there's no key: value pair datatype in python, only unordered sets of key:value pairs, so things quickly get confusing"
631,1503567335.000297,Suellen,What's confusing about a dict?; Every Python programmer knows what to do with a function that outputs a dictionary.
631,1503567378.000128,Lanita,"Ah, sorry, true, a Car object in this case is `Car = Dict[str, str]`"

633,1503573311.000203,Jenee,Is there anyone who is familier with HappyBase for Hbase Connectivity
634,1503579332.000092,Gustavo,"Design question for you guys.  Not sure what is considered the correct way to do this in python

I have 2 types of output files (s3 and fs).  I have created a class for each.

I have a script which actually creates the data and then writes it to the output files (obviously the s3 and fs classes are abstracing out the differences between the two).

I have been debating if it is better to pass the class of the output file in, or pass a generator function in which can create the output format.  At first was leaning towards the class, but the more I think about it, the more I am leaning towards a generator function.  

Multiple output files are created by the script which is why I can't just pass an actual instance of the object."
634,1503579494.000206,Collette,"That sounds like a case for a function; `write_to_s3` and `write_to_fs`, specifically"
634,1503579649.000354,Gustavo,"well the function wouldn't actually do the writing, just generate the ""file"" to write to; I basically just wrapped up the s3 to act like a file object so I could write and read to it like a normal file"
634,1503579746.000577,Collette,ah
634,1503579748.000478,Gustavo,this way the script doesn't care where it is writing
634,1503579803.000187,Collette,Then you just need to accept a file-like object to write into.
634,1503579835.000398,Gustavo,right kinda.  since the script is generating multiple files I can't just pass in the object
634,1503579850.000434,Collette,You'll need an object per file
634,1503579871.000069,Gustavo,"I was initially thinking to just pass in the class, but started to lean more towards passing in a funciton that returns the object"
634,1503579873.000236,Collette,Just like you need a regular file object per file
634,1503579879.000362,Gustavo,"correct; would it be better to pass in an open_s3_file function or just pass in the s3_file class that responds to open (just like a normal file); both will work, just wondering what is considered more pythonic"
634,1503579974.000158,Collette,It would be better to pass a `S3File` instance that acts like a file-like object.
634,1503580011.000288,Gustavo,"I can't pass the instance since I don't have it yet.   The script will need to create a bunch of them; the script/function is basically reading a bunch of tables from a database, doing some transformations and then writing them out to files; the destination could be an s3 or standard filesystem; the way it is currently written it only writes to the standard filesystem, I am trying to abstract out the destination so that it can write to s3 as well"
634,1503580529.000115,Bruno,"Yeah, pluginbase module seems to do what I want"
634,1503580966.000236,Meg,this particular case has to do with looking in solr(pysolr) and S3(boto)  So I need to handle possible throws of `pysolr.SolrError` as well as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError`
634,1503581277.000203,Collette,<@Gustavo> I don't think you're trying to understand what I'm trying to say. Can you look from another point of view?
635,1503580885.000454,Meg,"so, lets say you have a section of code with multiple try-catch blocks.  Which do you prefer: breaking them out to handle specific exceptions, or just have a catch-all for everything?"

635,1503580987.00031,Meg,"right now, I'm doing the former"
636,1503583604.000387,Blanche,"Hello everyone - I'm looking for direction on a work project. I'll put a sample of the information I can get below.  I work in a factory making car parts. There are two plants, about 10 departments in each plant. About 650 machines total. I would like to have something set up that I can see machine downtime by week/month/year, by department/plant/machine. I would like to see the count of breakdown occurrences, and various other information. (I'd love to explain if someone has time to talk to me about it). Anyway, i can export our reports to csv and get the information from there..But not sure what to do with it. Should I be looking into classes, or a database, etc."
636,1503583638.000102,Beula,Are they handled the same or different? 
636,1503583639.00047,Blanche,"Report number | Date | Machine Number | Downtime | Description; There are 10,000 reports for this year alone. I made a massive spreadsheet to break all of this down, but it's soooooo slow; Not sure what direction to go with this"
636,1503583992.000605,Suellen,"If you're familiar with databases, or have someone who is familiar with them, then why not - put stuff there. You basically get aggregations for free, and aggregations are a foundation for all reports.; On the other hand, `pandas` can load CSV data and make reports on the fly as well. No need for a database if it's not a whole lot of data ( &lt;10 GB)"
636,1503584482.000478,Meg,"differently, primarily by setting different variable values"
636,1503584491.000011,Blanche,"It'll all be text, so small... I don't have any familiarity with databases, so I'll check pandas out"
636,1503584492.000538,Meg,which are then later set to a django model field
636,1503584494.000701,Blanche,Thank you very much
636,1503584523.000116,Meg,that was the primary reason I split up into multiple try-except blocks
636,1503584609.000055,Beula,"Yeah, if anything is different I'd have the two separate handlers"
636,1503587665.000231,Winnifred,"<@Blanche>, if the project is very time-sensitive, I agree with <@Suellen> ‘s suggestion, but if you’re going to be doing this sort of thing regularly, it might be good to start learning databases by building out small jobs to extract and store your data."
637,1503587691.000465,Blanche,"It's not urgent, just trying to impress people :slightly_smiling_face:  Any specific place to start with a database?"

637,1503588774.000517,Beula,Postgres for lyfe
637,1503588806.000674,Suellen,it's funny that postgres is more efficient with non-relational data than mongodb...; a cruel joke almost
637,1503588905.000614,Vada,"The answer to most questions which contain the word ""data"" in them is ""postgres""; Not that I can answer the Q"
637,1503589511.000762,Ciera,not that much I think
637,1503589543.000475,Bruno,probably. i havent researched much of the difference between json/jsonb in postgres yet.
637,1503589551.00022,Vada,"`jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.`; from the docs; with indexing it could make a huge difference; 100k is not very big in the db world <@Bruno>; xD"
637,1503589618.000358,Ciera,<https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/jsonb-type-performance-postgresql-9-4/>
637,1503589624.000066,Bruno,oh i know. but if im already filtering by user...; but i suppose there could be 1m after a lot of time. its for personal budgeting. so the the largest table would be all the bank transactions that come in.
637,1503589714.000411,Vada,which could get big very quickly
637,1503589774.000699,Bruno,"yea.; granted, it will be a while before i get there and can come up with a plan later on. but yea.; so, this is what the transaction data coming in would look like <https://plaid.com/docs/api/#transactions>; yea."
637,1503590029.000163,Suellen,because pg can change a strategy for a query depending on quite a few factors
637,1503590039.000012,Bruno,and i plan on doing that. but im no DBA. so still asking for input and advice.
637,1503590058.000502,Suellen,we will help you :heart:
637,1503590095.000613,Bruno,"im trying to get that transactions endpoint working by this evening.; chances are, i will probably be ok storing it in jsonb and just taking a few fields in the json and duping them as normal fields to make it easier to do some math operations.; how much less efficient is it to query records where a field is in a json type, compared to say a standard varchar field (assuming both are indexed)"
638,1503589503.000716,Vada,but it will depend on JSON vs JSONB right?
638,1503589556.000518,Bruno,yea. but what if theres 10k records. or 100k; ah sounds like i would prefer jsonb then.
638,1503589939.000171,Winnifred,couldn’t `EXPLAIN` help you here ?
638,1503590004.000184,Suellen,"only post-factum, when you already have data and indexes; you should use the first one everywhere, even in tests; i.e. absolute import; what's your directory layout? are tests outside your package?"
639,1503604053.000189,Bruno,"<@Signe> i may use waspy. its simple enough. also, when i ran the docker container with composer, it had an error related to rabbitmq; wrong channel anyways... <#C07G5276F|async>"
640,1503603982.000164,Lester,the tests are in a directory along side the ClassUnderTest.py
640,1503604061.000048,Bruno,bleh

640,1503604344.000142,Suellen,"so, generally the easiest layout is like this:; ```

640,1503604415.000127,Suellen,this way you only ever use `from ProjectName.x import y`
640,1503604889.000266,Lester,thanks <@Suellen> that did the trick
640,1503605690.000195,Deedee,"`__init__.py` goes inside of `ProjectName`, right? What is `tactisiege` in your example <@Suellen> ?"
640,1503605725.000354,Suellen,"root project name, but yeah; `ProjectName` is a module so to speak"
640,1503605746.000016,Bruno,__init__.py has to be in a folder in order for the python interpreter to be able to see into that dir and load files from it as modules
640,1503605798.000124,Deedee,that makes sense. thx
640,1503606099.000228,Lester,"fwiw, I was also able to leave tests where they were (under ProjectName/) by adding .. to my env's search path"
640,1503606141.000512,Suellen,that's... not great
640,1503606165.000336,Lester,oh yea? I was afraid you'd say that cause I like it better :-X
640,1503606170.000352,Suellen,"changing system path isn't really a nice solution, only temporarily"
640,1503606265.000415,Lester,"if I understand it correctly, I only changed it in my virtualenv that the unit tests run in not system level, still not the greatest?"
640,1503606325.000024,Suellen,what if you distribute this package to users?
640,1503606329.000229,Lester,I have to cd into the tacticsiege/ directory in my notebooks before I import but that's fine
640,1503606333.000167,Suellen,you can't really expect them to modify their paths
640,1503606371.000155,Lester,"yes, understood, bummer... had a bad smell to it but saves me a project in my larger solution file"

644,1503644252.00006,Dell,":waving_white_flag: I'm confused about something

This app is creating an object which calls another class' _init_ and then later modifies the variables within based on a config file. When a function from that particular class is called, it uses the init values, not the ones assigned outside the class. 

Clearly this is some kind of scoping issue but understand it well enough to explain it to my colleague. :confused:"
644,1503644627.000102,Collette,<@Dell> can you show us the code?
644,1503644736.0001,Dell,"technically no but I kind of boiled it down to the essence here; so where this json is loading and setting it, that works - but when _run_ is called those assignments don't exist; it just goes back to None; ahhh yeah that's much more straightforward"
644,1503645928.000188,Collette,"AFAIK when you edit a message with taco, the tacobot can't notice that"
644,1503645933.000139,Dell,noooo; <@Collette> :taco:

644,1503645967.000046,Ramona,Finally I understand how the taco bot works...

644,1503653364.000189,Leigh,"because i'm installing them on Alpine linux,; pypa's shiny ""manylinux"" wheels does not work; so it builds everything from ground up; I saw there are discussions on adding ""musllinux"" tag but it seems to be taking some time to get agreement"

644,1503653495.000192,Leigh,I tried `MAKEFLAGS` `MAKEOPTS` environment variables but pip seems to just call the C compiler directly without using Makefile

644,1503653755.000065,Suellen,"<@Collette> why unfortunately? :cry:; y u no like tacobot; you know, when the robot / AI apocalypse starts.. I know I'm gonna be their friend; <@Leigh> wheels don't work because Alpine uses a very peculiar C library"
644,1503653919.00019,Junita,"<@Assunta> rubocop is for ruby, you’ll want the python equivalent which will be something like flake8; or maybe someone has something for recent to suggest, it’s been a while since I’ve set up a python project"
644,1503653955.00006,Assunta,ah I can use flake8. I will look on it <@Junita>; thanks; yes please. I need help on how to ensure to align my team in python development; because I am preparing all the process materials we need
644,1503654010.000103,Ramona,<@Junita> isn't the flavor of the month pylint? Is there any significant difference between flake8 and pylint?
644,1503654011.000075,Leigh,"<@Suellen> yeah, i already know -- i'm asking how to build c-based packages faster; (even not on alpine linux); i can bear with that i need to build things from ground up, but i want to make the build processes fast"
644,1503654090.00019,Ciera,wheel are not available ?
644,1503654096.000286,Meg,not on alpine; make a docker image; accept the slow build time; deploy to docker hub
644,1503654124.000206,Assunta,how about unit testing any idea?
644,1503654129.000045,Junita,so it’s been a while since I’ve looked into this stuff.
644,1503654130.000201,Meg,and use that image
644,1503654135.000371,Ciera,hmm. could you built your own wheel and upload on your own devpi or something ?
644,1503654139.000004,Leigh,hmm
644,1503654143.000047,Ciera,but not sure that easier to do
644,1503654153.000302,Leigh,i'm already using multi-staged builds to make it fast
644,1503654170.000048,Ciera,<@Assunta> standard library unittest module or pytest
644,1503654177.000246,Leigh,"then, another way of question: how to determine all the file list that is created by the build process of a wheel?"
644,1503654190.000203,Junita,"yeah I think pytest is the common thing these days.  there again I’m out of date, using nose still"
644,1503654213.000307,Ciera,yeah pytest is the common one
644,1503654226.00011,Assunta,thanks <@Ciera>; I will look on it. since I am not aware in python. I used in Ruby Rspec and TDD. using codeship; but will look fully on it; thanks guys for the details.
644,1503654293.000175,Leigh,"i'm already doing like this:
```
FROM python:3.6-alpine as python-source
RUN cd /; tar czpf python.tar.gz /usr/local/

FROM myimage:latest

RUN cd /; tar xzpf python.tar.gz

644,1503654301.000342,Ciera,pytest might have somehting for TDD (but not sure I don't use it)
644,1503654315.000015,Leigh,"maybe if i can do the same for cython/scipy/pandas/..., it will be great"
644,1503654390.000207,Assunta,"<@Ciera> ok, but is there anyway to have a continuous development that includes unit testing? I found this book: <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html> using django; but I am not sure If I am on the right track"
644,1503654411.000178,Ciera,that depend on your CI
644,1503654421.000057,Junita,yeah that’s more of a process question than a tools question
644,1503654423.000033,Ciera,you might also want to look into `tox`; `Gives boto a facelift` Nice one :smile:
644,1503654464.000086,Junita,heh
644,1503654573.00011,Leigh,"so, would it be sufficient to zip &amp; copy the package directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy`), with some tweaks on pkg-info files"
644,1503654579.000128,Suellen,"<@Leigh> <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/7af5d3e92a59906927a566e5dc4a99eeaca49b96/.travis.yml>

644,1503654658.000106,Leigh,setuptools seems not to use makefile at all
644,1503654659.000267,Suellen,"there's a `--global-option` and `--install-option` for pip, but these options are passed to `setup.py` and it must deal with those -- again not standard"
644,1503654677.000201,Leigh,"tried, but only some packages have their own specific options via that interface; there seems to be no general way; :disappointed:"
644,1503654730.000202,Suellen,yeah :disappointed:
644,1503654730.000266,Leigh,hm; i think i should go for separate image builds (either using multi-staged or different images) to build wheels for alpine linux
644,1503654760.000086,Suellen,"haha, you can override `make` to point to an alias `make -j4`; but that's crazy; but, I mean... if it works.."
644,1503655107.000007,Meg,"<@Leigh> <https://github.com/mzdaniel/alpinewheels>; its a little out of date, but perhaps you can use the context within to make progress?"
644,1503655228.000006,Leigh,oh... thanks for the reference!
644,1503655669.000038,Suellen,<@Leigh> turns out `cython` doesn't use `make` at all

647,1503654055.000366,Ciera,<@Ramona> I don't thing there is. But I'm not a big user of them. I usually just put flake8 with a little bit of options and that's all
647,1503654119.000073,Junita,<@Ramona> quite possible.  once I have that kinda stuff going on a project it tends to stay that way

663,1503841808.000027,Suellen,"if you haven't created an extension, how would you use types from it in your table columns?"
663,1503846180.000018,Thomasina,"<@Suellen> uhhh.....magic, of course.; `return User_Report.query.filter(func.ST_DWithin(geom::geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(lon, lat), 4326)::geography, 50000))`
Why does this keep giving me a syntax error?; Looks perfectly fine to me; Oh wait, is `::geography` an SQL and not a Python thing?"
663,1503847501.000031,Suellen,it is :slightly_smiling_face:; probably even postgres specific
663,1503847524.000066,Thomasina,"Ah, ok, my bad; `cast(geom, Geography)` is supposedly the way to do it but it doesn't work because `name 'cast' is not defined` but I don't know why and there are literally no relevant results when I search. :confused:; I must be missing something but I don't know what"
663,1503850443.000028,Suellen,`func.cast(...)`; I'm not 100% certain
663,1503850527.000025,Meg,You need to work with sql and not python for that 
663,1503850557.000026,Suellen,doesn't GeoAlchemy provide helpers?
663,1503850571.000045,Meg,"I'm on mobile so don't have the links handy, but postgis has exactly the same queries you're looking for; If it's anything like geodjango, it implements some but not the entire feature set"

663,1503850655.000058,Meg,"Sweet!; There's certainly a learning curve to figure what's been implemented in the orm and what hasn't.; For example, geodjango doesn't have any clustering built into it, but you can do it with postgis once you install the nearest neighbor extension "
663,1503851567.000089,Thomasina,Definitely. I figured out how to do what I wanted to do using SQL in the command line but didn't realize it'd be a bit different in Python.
663,1503851586.000019,Meg,It will be; Because geoalchemy has its own interface to use; So you'll have to translate from a working sql call to how geoalchemy does it

I'm using a RecycleView, following the instructions found here: <https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.recycleview.html>

Unfortunately, I don't see a way to get selected items. Rather, I can get a all items, but nothing that says they are selected. There is the callback for when an item is selected, and I could populate my own dictionary as they are selected, but it would be preferable to access a property that returns just the selected.

674,1504034822.000256,Meghan,I'm thinking I'll add a callback to it that updates a dictionary in the rv object then just retrieve from there. Would think that would be something they would have included though.
674,1504034855.000457,Ciera,myabe there is something to get all checkbox and then you can just find the one you want in those ? selected or not
674,1504034940.000394,Meghan,"It's actually a listbox type of interface.; But, I think I'll just add a callback into the RV object and maintain a dictionary there.; As you can see from the screenshot, user interface design is not my specialty."

676,1504046612.000134,Beula,Correct due to scoping rules; baz is defined in a nested scope that's not visible to you after it's returned

Image gallery, with functionality: everyone can see images, admin can see add remove edit. Images/posts contain info, title, image etc

So very simple; what I know I need pretty much is Flask, authentication, somewhere to upload them (?) and fetch them and show them.

So, what I was thinking is using s3, flask with some authentication, any better ideas on the workflow?; Haven't really deployed any python apps so I am a bit confused. Although, I once did deploy one to my on VPS, but it was quite a mess to hassle round with UWSGI + other"
682,1504094501.00022,Ciera,if it's simple flask is a good way to go :slightly_smiling_face:; (and if it's more complex it's also a good way)

682,1504094581.00016,Meg,<@Shirl> can you confirm that keypress events are being received in your code?; <@Sean> that's pretty easy to do!; thats where communities like this are handy
682,1504094637.0002,Junita,<@Sean> one thing to look at - you can pass signed urls to the client and have them upload the images directly to s3 so they don’t have to go through your server
682,1504094667.000194,Sean,"<@Junita> something like this is exactly what I was hoping for - even ignoring the whole server part all in all, but is this possible?"
682,1504094685.00025,Meg,"well, you need some way to have auth, right?"
682,1504094692.000055,Ciera,you would still need a flask + postgres behind
682,1504094693.000111,Sean,for the admin to upload - yes.; <@Ciera> exactly; where do I keep that then? also in AWS?
682,1504094707.000349,Junita,"well, you *can* do auth using lambda and their cognito service"
682,1504094751.000076,Meg,"one downside with direct to s3 upload is you're relying on the client for the upload, and bypassing restrictions can be done"
682,1504094757.000077,Junita,might be easier to start thought just doing a simple flask app
682,1504094779.000081,Meg,"if you do it server side, that's trickier to work around, and you'll be able to store metrics and other info about the uploads/images"
682,1504094796.000277,Junita,<@Meg> when you create the signed url you can restrict it to that specific file upload

Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.

Yes:

def f(x): return 2*x
No:

f = lambda x: 2*x
The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically 'f' instead of the generic '&lt;lambda&gt;'. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression)```"

694,1504195710.000093,Everett,"Hey all. I have a question, and I hope this is the right Slack to ask it in. I am trying to get Molecule to work on Windows 7 to test Ansbile roles. I get everything installed, however, when I try and run Molecule, it tells me that sh 1.12.14 is currently not available on Windows, and to install pbs instead. I used pip install pbs, but now I am not sure how to actually get Molecule to use it instead of sh."

695,1504202480.00012,Suellen,<@Tameika> where does it stop behaving in a predictable manner?
695,1504202618.000167,Tameika,"<@Suellen> : i think the problem is this line :  ` new_rows = delegate(someLib.process(req), req.image_path, image_url)`; when I comment that line, the whole program runs fine"
695,1504202727.000471,Suellen,"so, relevant code is probably there"
695,1504202894.000679,Tameika,"true, i think it has got do with the fact that the `someLib.process(req)` is being called by multiple workers"
695,1504202905.00021,Suellen,"what is that library?; hm.. even if it's not thread-safe, does that mean it's not multiprocess-safe?; I'm honestly not sure"
695,1504202998.000451,Tameika,it is a library which I created myself to wrap C++ code. Didnt take it account thread safety
695,1504203043.0003,Suellen,"in theory it should be ok, since a whole process is launched for the task; a debugger of some kind is your best bet, guessing will only take you so far; One guess left:
&gt; req = someLib.Request(); This is a shared resource that's used between processes; that's not very good; can you refactor it so that each worker gets its own copy?"
695,1504203212.000139,Tameika,sure will do; it still waits; essentially it prints all the 'before' statements and hangs
695,1504203850.000141,Suellen,inside `delegate` too?; up until you call a C function?
695,1504203907.00032,Tameika,"delegate does not call the C function , it is `someLib.process(req)` which does; i even decoupled that line into 2 lines : ```c_resp = someLib.process(req)"
695,1504204035.000177,Suellen,you most definitely need a real debugger then
696,1504203976.000055,Tameika,"` new_rows = delegate(c_resp, req.image_path, image_url)```"

697,1504211977.000302,Suellen,probably not :disappointed:; but it's saved in your current session
697,1504214449.000311,Bruno,"hmm. more efficient way to write this if theres a million `accounts` and you just need to return the first:
```
account = [acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity'][0]

while keeping it in a generator. easy if just using a loop"
697,1504215055.000341,Antionette,<@Bruno> can you do `account = next(acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity')`
697,1504215568.000106,Bruno,"<@Antionette> hmm, ill have to try that."
697,1504215640.000002,Antionette,<@Bruno> afaik it should only run until first is found
697,1504215912.000186,Bruno,no but if it doesnt exist it will throw an exception.; which is fine.
697,1504216321.00005,Antionette,"<@Bruno> I believe it could also take in a default argument like: `account = next((acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity'), false)` if you wanted to do it like that.  I think your original example would have also thrown an error if it was not found (list index out of range)"

698,1504215631.000321,Suellen,don't forget about iter!; doesn't exhaust the generator!
698,1504215929.000352,Bruno,so need try/catch

698,1504218157.000205,Antionette,the comprehension part would return an empty list and then trying to get the first element would raise the exception

702,1504253374.000095,Ciera,I believe it's best to `.gitignore` the `.pyc` files
702,1504253434.000147,Beverley,i did but they were added to the log before I added *.pyc to gitignore actually just did a commit without adding the files and it worked

        yield next(group)

703,1504258251.000036,Ciera,<@Denna> those predifined conditions are string ?
703,1504258251.000075,Gabriele,<@Denna> I think that depends largely on the semantics of those conditions. `eval` is almost certainly not the answer though
703,1504258281.000079,Denna,<@Ciera> they are coming from users of the system; not from a programmer

703,1504258370.000159,Gabriele,How are users able to formulate these conditions when they obviously refer to code details (like the existence of an 'is_admin' property)
703,1504258470.000141,Lanita,"Perhaps this explains it better:

```
from typing import Sequence, TypeVar, Callable, Any, Generator
from itertools import groupby

703,1504258497.000013,Denna,"we're giving a simple doc about available variables to them; in practice, there is no ""user.is_admin"" for them; i mean, the real input is, ""is_admin"", and i change it with ""self.request.user.is_admin"" like thing"
703,1504258567.000107,Gabriele,If you truly do have an arbitrary list of completely unrelated conditions then I fear that there is very little that can be done to improve your situation
703,1504258584.0001,Denna,fair enough; thanks btw
703,1504258624.000259,Gabriele,If you can simplify the conditions in some way - e.g. to make them all into conjunctions (everything must be true) - then you can make it more data-driven
703,1504258635.000372,Lanita,"hm, in this case we're sorting `seq` first so we're not getting the first value of `seq` as much as ""exactly one value from seq"", but it doesn't matter for me at the moment"
703,1504258671.000221,Suellen,I'm really not sure how to change it right now
704,1504276114.00072,Pura,"Hello everyone, i have a question about class initialization

so i have a class that i am importing into a main .py file. Lets call it imp_mod.

i have the init defined so that when i call imp_mod.ClassName() it runs the init. but it also seems to be running the rest of the methods inside of the class. Why would it be doing that?"
704,1504276217.000432,Meg,"so you have something like 

```
class ImpMod:
    def __init__(self):
        # some code here
```; and you’re calling it via `imp_mode.ImpMod()`?"
704,1504276275.000627,Pura,yes
704,1504276418.000248,Meg,what do you have defined in the `__init__`?
704,1504276665.000332,Pura,underneath that i have a function that runs the self.desktop_driver called def search(self) and it runs a loop. When i call imp_mod.ImpBot() it seems like it is running that search function that isnt being called in init
704,1504276795.000078,Gabriele,"You don't seem _sure_ though. Have you tried putting a print statement in that search function to confirm, one way or the other?"
704,1504276844.000222,Pura,"i just did as a sanity check, and my print statement inside search does appear; might it be because in the main function i am assigning it to a variable?"
704,1504276911.000073,Meg,would you mind adding the entire `ImpBot class`?
704,1504276912.000197,Gabriele,You'll have to show the code
704,1504276920.000014,Pura,bot = imp_mod.ImpBot(); sure
704,1504277023.000364,Meg,"does it also happen when you do

```
from imp_mod import ImpBot
bot = ImpBot()

704,1504277085.000587,Pura,ill see; yes it still does it
704,1504277157.000204,Meg,what is `search_terms`; and where are you declaring it
704,1504277199.000394,Pura,search terms is an array of strings that lives outside of the class but in the same file
704,1504277218.000294,Gabriele,Most likely it's the stuff outside the class that is causing this problem
704,1504277223.000571,Pura,ok
704,1504277235.000784,Gabriele,perhaps something is making an instance and calling .search()?
704,1504277257.000663,Pura,"so...i have a tkinter button; ill put that file in; h/o; the command arg is set to call the search; so that may be it, but idk why it is running it before the Tkinter menu even appears"
704,1504277334.000478,Gabriele,perhaps it's set up wrong. sometimes people put in the `()` in the UI code when they shouldn't
704,1504277392.00021,Pura,ohhhh; so im doing .search()
704,1504277400.000498,Gabriele,exactly
704,1504277402.000695,Pura,"when it should just be .search; ohhhhhh; WORKS; thank you, i didnt know that that would make a difference"
704,1504277446.00039,Gabriele,glad we could help
704,1504277491.000321,Pura,<@Gabriele> <@Meg> :+1:; so that is a general python rule then? that if it has the () at the end it will run it regardless?
704,1504277522.000647,Meg,"depends, really; is it being passed as an argument to a method that is expecting a function or method?; or is it to be executed at that point?"
704,1504277569.00043,Gabriele,the `()` means 'call this function immediately'; so you're assigning the result of that function call to `command`
704,1504277591.000266,Pura,ahhhh
704,1504277593.000103,Gabriele,when you really want to assign the _function itself_ to `command`
704,1504277607.000108,Pura,"right, makes sense to me; it shouldnt be called instantly, since it is a button and should only be called when pressed; so no (); got it!"
704,1504277742.000203,Meg,"however, there are places where you do need the function to be called right away; for example, django url definitions with class based views; you have to use the `.as_view()` call when mapping a view class to a URL, or it won’t work"
704,1504277806.000056,Gabriele,"yeah, sometimes you have to call a function which returns the function you want to assign. functions returning functions. :slightly_smiling_face:"

711,1504348256.000018,Ciera,I think people are trying to focus on core first as it's the most important part
711,1504348271.000037,Suellen,"true that, even Core is fantastic"
711,1504348607.000069,Adalberto,I think Core is now async and only ORM is the problem. Also there is a great article by Mike: <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>
711,1504348658.000038,Suellen,"great article, in which he says he doesn't care about async and nobody should :confused:"
711,1504348731.000051,Adalberto,"<@Suellen> yes, it's a bit strange that he says that. But he also recommends gevent to solve the same problems, and some long time Python users told me that using gevent is insane in production."
711,1504348763.00004,Gabriele,It's pretty clear from the Core docs that it's not intrinsically an async API
711,1504348781.000044,Suellen,"gevent isn't really insane, it has a looong history and is stable"
711,1504348785.000056,Adalberto,This reply: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pylons-discuss/hI9zY4JYBU4/yNGGbE-IAgAJ>
711,1504348793.000001,Suellen,but it IS a very non-native approach; funny that he says it's inappropriate to use async with databases; when threads are just async functions from the POV of the OS
711,1504348996.000041,Ciera,fyi this might be more a topic for <#C07G5276F|async> :slightly_smiling_face:
711,1504349030.000009,Suellen,sorry mr admin
711,1504349953.000021,Ciera,haha well it's also that I'm sure some people in <#C07G5276F|async> might have good arguments on this topic and not sure they are all in here
712,1504346720.000046,Adalberto,"Hi, does anyone have any experience in using aiohttp 2.0+ vs. sanic as a HTTP server?"
712,1504346840.00004,Ciera,<@Adalberto> I use aiohttp and it get the job done. didn't try sanic
712,1504346948.000035,Adalberto,<@Ciera> do you use it for a full webserver or only for slower endpoints? Are you using it with an ORM?
712,1504348087.000044,Ciera,Well it's best to use a non blocking one obviously. There is some work on making sqlalchemy work with asyncio; for example this <https://github.com/CanopyTax/asyncpgsa> by <@Signe> but it's only for sqlalchemy core

714,1504368603.000087,Suellen,"what do you mean?; you can't set a transparent pixel on an image that doesn't have a transparency (alpha) channel; you need to convert from RBG to ARBG before you put a tranparent pixel there; and obviously when you save, you should use a format that supports alpha channels. For example png."

714,1504390486.000062,Sidney,"AFAIK, yes, the result of the authorization comes to me as a HTTP request to the callback URL.; There's a chance I misunderstand how OAuth 1.0 works."
714,1504390569.000026,Suellen,"I only ask because, for example, you can auth on Reddit using OAuth without a redirect or a callback"
714,1504390587.000011,Sidney,Is it OAuth 1.0 or 2.0?
714,1504390605.000021,Suellen,2.0
714,1504390614.000022,Sidney,"That might be one of the differences.; Or more likely, I'm completely misunderstanding how this works.; <@Suellen> Thanks for the link. Keeping everything in python and in the same codebase will definitely make this easier to manage. I'll look into that library further."
714,1504396075.000034,Gabriele,"<@Sidney> There are often 2 different authentication flows available - one for clients, and one for servers. Make sure you're using the right one for your situation"
714,1504401423.000015,Sidney,"<@Gabriele> I don't follow. From what I understand all authentication flows require a client **and** a server, each playing a different role in the exchange.; I am writing a Python program part of which authenticates with OAuth 1.0 to access a privileged API. I have figured out how to get the authorization URL. After signing in, the browser redirects to <http://localhost> which I registered as the callback with the provider. How do I get the request to localhost and continue with my bot? I figure I need to have a http server of some sort. I would rather not install a full Apache server. What is a lightweight alternative that can receive the request and forward the token to my bot code to continue with API calls?"

719,1504434747.000052,Ramona,What's up with people not just posting their problems? :grimacing: how is anyone supposed to help that way 
719,1504436012.000034,Suellen,"<@Galen> post in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, they are much more likely to help; <@Augusta> also we have a <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> channel where you can post your problem"
720,1504444696.000061,Monty,"does anybody use PyCharm? When I switch tabs, I want   Run/Debug in the upper right corner to change automatically. Now I have to manually select the file which I want to Run/Debug everytime I switch a tab."
720,1504444770.000052,Meg,"it won’t; pycharm usually has the last run execution as the top option in the dropdown; but you can right click in the file after changing the tab and select Run or Debug; if that’s something that you would find handy to have, you can submit a feature request at <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY>; but a major problem for that is most run configurations are project based, not file based"
720,1504445222.000008,Monty,"yes, but don't you agree that it is silly for PyCharm, which is one of the best Python IDE's, to not have that option?"
720,1504445243.000081,Meg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯; make a feature request
720,1504445266.000044,Monty,How many times have I ran the wrong file :slightly_smiling_face:
720,1504445275.000083,Meg,right click -&gt; run; and then the list will be re-ordered
720,1504445353.000043,Monty,"yeah, I know, I'am using that option...I will submit a request"
720,1504445359.000057,Meg,"for me, it would be an absolutely useless feature; because I’m project-based, not file based"
720,1504445371.00006,Monty,why is that?
720,1504445384.000006,Meg,"so, if I keep changing files and tabs in a project, I don’t want to run the current file; I want to run the entire project; so if I have a django or flask project going on, and I edit the models file.  I don’t want the run configuration to automatically switch to running that file, vs the project run configuration I already have active"
720,1504445486.000024,Monty,"ohh...I am a absolute beginner, so I find that lack of option strange and unintuitive"
720,1504445565.000004,Meg,"ah, ok.  for you, it might make more sense to have that kind of option.  But I would suspect that for the vast majority of pycharm users, that would result in unintended side effects like how I described above; also, consider the fact that each file might have different interpreter and run arguments; so that would require you to create a run configuration for each file; if you switch over to a file that has no configuration set up, how would it behave?"
720,1504445714.000028,Monty,different interpreter? Why would someone want to change the interpreter?
720,1504445725.000006,Meg,one file runs on 3.5; other runs on 3.6.2; or you need to pass in a different argument to the interpreter
720,1504445760.000035,Monty,backward compatible?
720,1504445831.000025,Meg,"so, what pycharm lets you do is define interpreter configurations, where you can define interpeter executable paths or virtualenvs; and then apply in run config; so, for one project, if you need it to be backwards compatible, you can have a run config pointing to your 3.6 environment; named `project 3.6`; and another `project 3.5`; now, if you’re flipping from file to file intending to run it against a specific interpreter version, re-ordering the run configuration options will mess you up; and introduce a non-intuitive UI; so, from a UI experience, think about this; how much extra complexity will implementing your workflow introduce into the UI, and how to handle the edge cases?; compared to how many users this is actually targeted for?"
720,1504446083.000028,Monty,"I cannot fully understand you, but wouldn't it be logical when the file changes, interpreter for that specific file changes too?; In other words, when you change the file, Run configuration for that file changes too"
720,1504446157.000001,Meg,no; because pycharm is intended to be project based run configuration; not file based
720,1504446356.000022,Monty,"ok, I will get that later maybe, when I run into such problems :slightly_smiling_face: Do you have a time to help me with some code. I am building a simple calculator, about 25 lines of code"
720,1504446380.000078,Meg,ask here.  I suspect I’m not the only one around here now :slightly_smiling_face:
720,1504446395.00003,Monty,"I have made it, but I want to make it more efficient....; ok, the question is...how do I print dictionary value, if some variable is the same as dictionary key?; when that variable is found in dictionary, and it matches the dictionary key, I want the program to print the dictionary value that is associated with that key that matches that variable"
720,1504446713.000058,Meg,"you mean something like a dict `{'a'=0, 'b'=1, 'c'=3}` and  a variable `lookup_key = 'a'`?"
720,1504446783.000069,Monty,give me a few minutes to translate the code in english
720,1504446868.00001,Meg,no problem.  What’s your native language?
720,1504447058.000037,Monty,"Serbian; ```while True:
    print(
        ""Welcome to our shitttttty calculator. First, choose two numbers, the choose the operation."")

    first_number = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
    second_number = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))

    dictionary1 = {""addition"": first_number + second_number, ""substraction"": first_number - second_number,
              ""multiplication"": first_number * second_number, ""division"": first_number / second_number }

    user_input= str(input(""Choose your operation: ""))

    if user_input in dictionary1:
        print(dictionary1.items())
        break```"
720,1504447737.000053,Meg,"so, its `user_input` you’re looking for?"
720,1504447837.000011,Monty,"yes; I want to...; when user_input matches a key in dictionary1 (when their values are matched) , then to print the value of that matched key; I don't know how to target that"
720,1504447983.000048,Meg,"so, `dict` has a few methods on it that you would find useful here.  first, `items()` returns a tuple of `key, value`.  Also, `key()` returns a list of the keys, and `values()` does the same for values; so, here, you would want to leverage `keys()` for your `if user_input` conditional; for example, with your dict above, `addition in dictionary1.keys()` returns `True`"
720,1504448049.000032,Monty,"yes, I googled that a little, and I know that it returns the whole list of values and keys, but I want that one specific value from dictionary, not all of them..."
720,1504448075.000066,Meg,"alright; so, if you have `if user_input in dictionary1.keys()`:; and `addition` is user_input; so, you know `addition` is a key in the dict; how do you access keys with a dict?; `dictionary1[user_input]`"
720,1504448258.000076,Nita,"hey all, if anyone has any experience with selenium I've got a quick question I just posted in learning_python"
720,1504448356.000029,Monty,thanks...I did not know that I can target values outside of dictionary...
720,1504448378.000084,Meg,"oh, yes.; but remember, in order to get a value from a dict, you either have to know the key beforehand; eg, `dictionary`[‘addition’]`; or loop through it and doing some comparison"
720,1504448445.00004,Monty,aha...makes sense...
720,1504448605.000012,Meg,"if you want to simplify things, you can use list comprehensions

`[value for key, value in dictionary1.items() if key == user_input]`; which returns a list of matches"
720,1504448668.000049,Monty,"I came from more then a  year discrete math course, and I thought the transition would be much more easier. The most difficult thing in programming so far has been the understanding how the language actually works, quirks, what am I allowed and not allowed to do..."
720,1504448751.000034,Meg,"yup; there are two major difficulties, I feel; one: describe what you want to do in discrete steps; two, use the language syntax and tools to replicate the project steps; first language, you typically struggle with both at the same time, because you need to get the syntax and how to use it to do what you want; but after that, its easier to pick up another one"
720,1504448862.000062,Monty,"yes, exactly, number two is a bigger problem now :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,1504448863.000033,Meg,"like for me, I originally started in java; and there were lots of times where I felt I was paying the university for nothing more than to feel like an idiot; java and python have alot of good things; I’m equally comfortable wokrking in both; but then, I’m a full stack dev in both languages; everything from server configuration all the way to css styling for a web application"
720,1504449537.000016,Collette,"java seems okay to me, but java developers often overcomplicate things"
720,1504449581.000001,Monty,"Do you have Skype, email, facebook, or some other tools of communication where  I can ask you something when I get really stuck? :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,1504449719.000038,Collette,"like when they have a single class (a custom service sdk) with a bunch of methods to test, they're likely to
a) create the sdk interface (even if it's obvious there won't be an other implementation)
b) create the abstract base class implementing the interface (even there won't be more than one subclass, ever)
c) repeat a and b for the testing suite (!)"
720,1504449737.000085,Meg,"yep; all that is implemented ad nauseaum in the spring framework; architecture astronauts :slightly_smiling_face:; just ask here, to be honest"
720,1504449814.000038,Collette,"Oh, if only in the spring framework. Much likely in an in-house, custom framework which won't have many nice integrations and features spring provides"
720,1504449831.000091,Meg,"because I’m not really a mentor, nor do I have the time to be.  Also, being part of the community here means you get to ask questions and then as you get better, contribute back"
720,1504449881.000065,Monty,"sure, I understand"
720,1504449895.000083,Meg,"I’ve only worked on two large java projects.  one was in spring, other was in google web toolkit with a custom in-house library; and honestly, the in-house library was about 100KLOC of some of the best code I’ve ever read.  Sure, there were some warts in it that I was glad I didn’t have to implement, but overall the code quality was extremely high.  Most of the problems came with integrating with GWT.. so glad I don’t have to do that anymore"
720,1504450004.00004,Collette,You're lucky then
720,1504450023.000005,Meg,"I guess what I’m trying to say is in a community like this, you get more resources from multiple people than just relying on one person :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,1504450037.000027,Collette,"I'm definitely fan of a very specific, well-written, tested in-house library that does the thing"
720,1504450039.000069,Beula,"To be fair, originally a lot of that was pretty much required for proper unit test mocking ; In Java/spring"
720,1504450052.000008,Collette,"None of that applies to our current developers, unfortunately"
720,1504450493.000012,Monty,"no, I was not really looking for a mentor, I was looking for someone to answer some  questions when I get stuck,  5-10 minutes max, but as you said, I can get that help on the <#C07EFMZ1N|help> channel...maybe I was thinking that you are the only living person on that channel :smile:"
720,1504450628.00004,Meg,"ah, no worries :slightly_smiling_face:  thanks for understanding!"
721,1504449027.000011,Monty,"I was considering to start in Java, there are more jobs, more mature language, static typing, etc. But as soon as I saw hello world in Java and Python, I made my decision :smile:; np"

print(g)``` but i'd prefer it on one line"
723,1504457387.000017,Beula,"If it's always a similar format you could regex it and get the groups, but that's less obvious and I'd favor a few lines to a single line if it isn't as clean "

There's a good example by them `<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/transcribe_streaming_mic.py#L170>` That deals with streaming from a mic. I've gotten this `transcribe_streaming_mic.py` to work. But I'm a little confused with if I should be using async vs sync.... and how to modify this for my use case. I want to only collect up to five seconds of data at a time with the ability to short circuit the `listen_print_loop` if a certain condition is met. I'm think I can put a timer around the `with MicrophoneStream` and I can have the listen_print_loop(responses) throw an exception when it meets a certain condition (timeout= 5 seconds, or correct response).

730,1504529443.000194,Suellen,"It's useful when you need to test your codebase against a matrix of dependencies; i.e. you webapp supports Django 1.11, 1.10 and 1.9; and it also works with Python 2.7 and 3.3+; just `make test` or `py.test` will only test against your current configuration"
730,1504529515.000232,Ciera,or to run multiple test one after another :slightly_smiling_face:
730,1504529591.000038,Lanita,"Right now, with my django tests, I'm using manage.py test, but that's inside of the env. I guess you'd use tox as an alternative to starting a specific venv and running the tests; What confused me intiially is that I do use a tox.ini file, but only for flake8 ignores and coverage omit's; but I can't seem to use it for mypy, I need a mypy.ini for that"
730,1504529712.000011,Ciera,as tox is widely use some tools allow you to put their configuration inside the `tox.ini` file to limit the number of configuration file; I have no idea if mypy allow that; there might be a command line arg to pass the configuration file
730,1504529737.000434,Lanita,"Mypy could easily add pattern matching for that, but I don't think it does; (hard to prove a negative :))"

731,1504543413.000087,Lana,You think maybe a solution could be setting up a venv?; Or makes no difference :confused:
731,1504543586.000135,Gabriele,Your most immediate solution is just to type that path out correctly.; Your second solution is to work out why you seem to be running the program from somewhere other than where the XML file is.
731,1504543772.000254,Lana,"Ok I found the full path, thanks... Tacos but, still thinking about the venv, maybe that's a better solution (beginner with that stuff, don't know if the venv really matters); :taco: <@Gabriele>; And, if yes, I have a serious problem because I just moved from atom to MacVim :S; And I'm kinda new using it so, I don't know anything about running venv's in vim."
731,1504543852.000115,Gabriele,Virtualenvs wouldn't really change the nature of this problem. Mostly it just ensures that your libraries are exactly what you want them to be.

731,1504545234.000032,Johana,"your class isn’t being created properly. Your `def find()` method has no ‘self’ being passed into it so it would need to be decorated with `@staticmethod`.; i would suggest structuring you class a little differently. I would pass in that full path like so

```
def __init__(self, xml_path=None):

I can't just break through this: 
How can I write test before my code using mocking if I'm not exactly sure what I want to use?
It's nice when You're testing behavior of something but when it comes to use some side-effect generating objects it's unbreakable wall for me.
I know how to write unittest, mock things .etc but I don't really know how to do testing before code when 
I'm not sure what will fit best.
For example when I'm using paramiko to do some sftp staff I simply can't predict every thing I do because I don't really know this lib enough. (Well, I know paramiko, this is just example :D)
When I'm trying stuff and checking how it works... well I'm ending up with already created solution... and then pre-testing is becoming a post-testing which shouldn't be done in TDD

Then you integrate the external lib into those functions (so none of your main app code uses the external lib, since that's an ""implementation detail"") and keep going until it's passing."

735,1504602356.000023,Lanita,"`from typing import Iterable, Iterator, Sequence`

An iterator describes the actual iterator object (e.g. what you get back when you run `iter(some_list)`).
An Iterable is some object `xs` that you can do `for x in xs: ...`
A Sequence describes an object `xs` that is an Iterable that also allows you to grab a specific element, e.g. `xs[4]` (that is, xs has a `__getitem__` method defined). An Iterable MAY have `__getitem__`, but a Sequence MUST have it.

Correct?; So, when I'm annotating a function, I could use Iterable if I want some duck typing and I know that I won't be accessing a specific member of the object, but I have to use Sequence if I ever access a specific member (e.g. I'll run `xs[-1]` at some point, if xs is the object we're annotating)"
735,1504602520.000094,Ciera,seems correct
735,1504602553.000129,Lanita,"This is all in the context of type annotations btw, which is why the official definitions as found in the docs might not match up; I really wish that the Callable type annotation was more advanced... It'd be cool if I could for example create a NewType for a Django view function, being a ""Callable whose first argument is HttpRequest, ignoring all the other aspects"". Right now the annotation is `Callable[[arg1, arg2], return_type]`, but there's no way of doing e.g. `Callable[[HttpRequest, ...], Any]`"
735,1504602918.000362,Collette,<@Lanita> why would you annotate a django's view function?
735,1504603131.000221,Lanita,"<@Collette>, it would make it clearer when writing e.g. decorators"
735,1504605374.000181,Collette,"<@Lanita> this is a very, very specific use-case. I doubt it's worth it to introduce a custom syntax to handle this case (imo, a good type checker should infer all necessary information automatically), but you can always open a feature request"
735,1504608020.000328,Lanita,"<@Collette> No, it's not anywhere near ""very very"" user specific. This is a standard part of python function definition syntax. E.g. doing `def f(some_arg, *rest_of_args)`; Being able to annotate that function as `Callable[[type(some_arg), ...], Any]` would be neat; It's also common when ""overloading"" methods in classes, e.g. class A has `def some_method(arg1)`, class B which inherits from class A has `def some_method(arg1, extra_arg)`; example of similar things proposed: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3157>"
735,1504612030.000032,Collette,"<@Lanita> you're implying that type annotations should be everywhere. No, they don't.
It would be good if `typing` would support that use-case, but to me it doesn't seem so much critical at all."
735,1504612075.000127,Lanita,"Well multiple people clearly think otherwise, as proven by the various issues on mypy with positive response regarding this subject..."
735,1504612339.000006,Collette,"Even more people haven't participated in these issues, who may have another opinion. But let's not discuss that.

Again, I'm not against this feature. I just think that
a) annotating everything will destroy one of the most important features of python (to me) - readability,
b) therefore it would be better to improve static type checkers to infer as much as possible;
c) however, I think we can live without type checking in this specific use-case because we lived without `typing` module for a quite long time and sky didn't fall, but
d) it won't hurt anyone if this feature is supported. Some folks will definitely find it useful.; That's why I proposed you to create a feature request, and looks like it's created already by someone else"

This somewhat works, but is ugly as can be:
```instance.__class__.__dict__[method_name](instance)```
Except, these are inherited objects, and inherited methods aren't accessible.

There must be a better way.; Actually, it looks like ```getattr``` will do that. Slightly less ugly."

737,1504635687.000341,Winnifred,"you’re operating on an instance of a class, why not write a method on instance to take in `self`?"

737,1504637020.000477,Winnifred,"This is what im thinking, but I don’t actually know what your function is doing."
737,1504637898.000348,Meghan,"Sorry, got distracted.

I see what you are saying. I think the getattr fits what I'm doing better.; I realize I didn't describe how I got there, so it makes it difficult. It is just a lot of code across different modules.

But, it's from a modular gui in kivy that is listing a pretty version of a method name, the user selects what objects, and from there what methods to run, and kivy then sends on the list of strings. It's been interesting, for sure."

No shading is happening...; `x2 = array([989971200000000000,` ..... `990057360000000000, 990057480000000000], dtype=int64)`"
744,1504705540.00016,Meg,that's your problem there; because you need to compare on the actual values in `x2`; try `where=numeric_timestamp in x2`
744,1504705656.00042,Jon,So I should make a new list and check if the *numeric* timestamps are in there?
744,1504705692.000663,Meg,"no need.  look at my example above; ah, correction; yes; you can use a list comprehesion for that"
744,1504705846.000663,Jon,"Something like this?
`where=[x for x in x2 if x in list]`"
744,1504706006.000104,Meg,"so, the `where` param uses a comparison to evaulate as true/false to determine where fill happens; if you pass in a list of values, it needs something to compare with; and the `in` keyword does an exact match; <https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between.html>; ah, correction.; pass in the list there; but you'd have to do it with a division and comparison"

744,1504706335.000412,Meg,"<@Jon> correct.  In your code example, `numeric_timestamp = 990014340000000000`"

I did `(x2[0] + x2[-1])/2` and got `9.9001434e+17`

<@Meg>"

```
[log_ID, log_ID, log_ID, log_ID}

744,1504707249.000691,Davida,"<@Lana> not necessarily, according to the docs (<https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#next>) it's callable on any iterator. I am unsure whether a generator is different to an iterator, though - that's where I'm kind of :scream: ing

    )
]`; you don't do anythin g on x or i"
744,1504707467.000026,Davida,"l.list_logs() returns a list of lists. Each nested list contains a field named ""log_identifier"". I'm trying to extract that field, and only that field."
744,1504707624.000666,Ciera,would somehting like that work `[x[2] for x in list_logs(...)]`

744,1504707728.000712,Ciera,fyi you can also put `if` statements inside a list comprehension
744,1504707779.000386,Davida,o.O; so glad I'm here
744,1504707908.000056,Ciera,"like `[x * 2 for x in [1,2,3,4] if x % 2 == 0]` will give you `[4,8]`"

750,1504735027.000026,Junita,"Docker itself is free (the community edition at least, but that’s all you need); Hosting it of course will require you to pay somebody, but docker has some nice tools to get you running with that on AWS or other cloud providers"
750,1504735089.000061,Forrest,We're on a VPS
750,1504735170.000271,Junita,Are you tied to this VPS?
750,1504735212.000236,Forrest,"Hmmm, I wouldn't say so, but to start the project we'll be using it since my friend is already paying it for his (small) WP site"
750,1504735245.000325,Junita,"If you sign up for AWS you get a decent amount of free tier credit.; I’d recommend against sharing the hosting with other things, especially WordPress."
750,1504735299.000358,Forrest,For security?
750,1504735338.00045,Junita,"yeah security, ease of management, etc."
750,1504735385.000137,Forrest,"The issue I ran into when I was checking hosts like Heroku, AWS was that it seems like people ends up paying a ton... So I checked DO, which looked nice but it's not managed. After, I found WebFaction and my friend already had a managed VPS on HostWinds so we thought it would be a good start lol"
750,1504735437.000297,Junita,"A lot can be done on Heroku on the free tier actually; And I mean yeah you can end up paying a ton on AWS as you scale up, but honestly at the kind of scale that becomes an issue it’s not really feasible to be doing this sort of stuff on managed VPS boxes"
750,1504735513.000181,Forrest,"Oh; So it might be possible for me to make the project on free Heroku to showcase it, then move it or scale up"
750,1504735552.00006,Junita,yup
750,1504735571.000423,Forrest,"I will look into this; It's a bit scary though lol, with the Dynos and the Databases and everything seems to be customizable haha..."
750,1504735611.000159,Junita,ha.  it’s not so bad.
750,1504735637.000277,Forrest,Im used to run PHP with MySQL/PHPMyAdmin on a shared hosting :stuck_out_tongue:
750,1504735645.000251,Junita,"it’s mostly a terminology issue, they complicate things with these crazy names like “dyno”; this stuff, in a sense, isn’t much different than what you did.  a “dyno” on heroku is basically just an instance of your application; and you put some files in standardized places so it knows how to run it; the big difference between running a python (or ruby or node) type web app and something like PHP via say Apache is that in Python you’ll usually run the application and have a webserver connect to via its ip address; so the user talks to say, Apache, like normal, and then instead of running mod_php or whatever inside apache, it will run what’s called a reverse proxy and send the connections to your web application’s ip and port"
750,1504735876.000397,Forrest,oh; that sounds weird to me lol
750,1504735944.000389,Junita,"ha.  it does seem kind of weird at first, but it can be beneficial, because for example you can have many workers behind a simple reverse proxy; and it’s also possible to develop locally without needing the whole big heavy apache server"
750,1504735987.000002,Forrest,"well, weird or not, I am very interested in both Python and NodeJS so gotta learn haha; I saw that Django seems to come with a kind of webserver on its own"
750,1504736018.000459,Junita,"yup, so that the reverse proxy can connect to it; and so you can develop locally"
750,1504736192.000007,Forrest,"I see; So, my learning stack would be: Docker -&gt; Heroku -&gt; Python -&gt; Django?"
750,1504736257.000244,Junita,"That’s up to you - you probably could get started with Django on Windows without too much fuss.; But in my experience things like Node or Python projects do tend to be more oriented towards unix like operating systems, so problems can arise.; So yeah, to your original point, putting things in Ubuntu would help there.; But there’s a learning cost, so in my opinion it’s worth it to just learn Docker instead, it’ll give you the same benefits and so many more.; And then too when you go to deploy the site, you can rest easy knowing you are deploying the same thing you developed on."
750,1504736381.000421,Britteny,Docker and Python have some decent courses on Pluralsight if you have a subscription.  The Django course there is kinda old now
750,1504736384.000269,Forrest,"Yeah... I am not very good in the ""sys"" side so the faster I can start coding, the faster I will be comfortable building the site lol xD"
750,1504736416.000051,Junita,"oh that’s a good idea, yeah a course like that might help jumpstart things a bit"
750,1504736430.000135,Forrest,I don't have an inscription but they give a 10 days free trial
750,1504736456.000148,Junita,"and that’s sort of the interesting thing too - Docker seems to many to be “advanced” but I actually think it helps do a good job of obfuscating a lot of the sys admin stuff pretty well; so that in the end that yes, you need to learn this tool, but things overall get a lot simpler."
750,1504736507.000092,Forrest,okay; well I suppose I could deal with Docker at the same time as I learn about Heroku; hum <@Britteny> do you have any specific course for Docker to recommend on pluralsight? There's like 63... xD
750,1504736597.000274,Junita,"yeah, make sure you feel comfortable with a simple hello world django app locally first"
750,1504736647.000216,Britteny,"Getting Started with Docker - was good; Also, for Python “Python Fundamentals” and “Python – Beyond the Basics” really helped me"
750,1504736721.000082,Forrest,oh nice they are much shorter than Udemy too lol
750,1504736782.000351,Britteny,"Beyond the Basics is longer, but in my opinion there is no filler.  It’s all great stuff.  Actually, Beyond the Basics I think is the best screencast I’ve seen"
750,1504736791.000081,Georgiana,Hey guys; Could you list the most typical questions on python interview?
750,1504736930.000142,Eve,Is python pass by reference or value?
750,1504736933.000164,Junita,I think that’d largely depend on the position
750,1504736996.000444,Georgiana,I am applying to back-end role
750,1504737050.000274,Junita,"Junior, or senior?"
750,1504737057.000063,Georgiana,by value;); Middle
750,1504737109.000312,Junita,not all arguments are by value
750,1504737124.000088,Eve,"Explain the HTTP Request/Response process; Describe RESTful APIs, HTTP verbs, idempotent, etc"
750,1504737179.000282,Junita,"actually a common related question is about mutable default arguments, since many people don’t realize that each time a function or method is instantiated, it gets a reference to the same object; so if you have `foo(bar=[])` and modify bar in foo, each run of foo() will be modifyin the same default bar; MVC architecture will often come up, as well as perhaps some questions about [No]SQL or any ORMs you have experience with."
750,1504737383.000339,Eve,"Definitely, also maybe some basic SQL, joins, 3rd normal form, etc"
750,1504737469.000317,Junita,"CORS, CSRF tokens, other security related questions might come up as well.; mid-level is tough for both the interviewer and the interviewee because a mid-level is naturally not going to know certain things"
750,1504737546.000019,Britteny,"I’m finding this kind of interesting.  When I interview these days, which has only really been for seniors recently, I’m generally looking for qualities above and beyond technical skills.  Your CV and Github / provided code should give evidence of that, and then I just want to understand  -how you solve problems, how do you learn something new, how do you work with your colleagues, how curious are you, how enthusiastic are you, when do you ask for help versus research on your own, etc"
750,1504737601.000226,Junita,yeah I certainly have moved away from a focus on very technical interview questions
750,1504737605.000252,Britteny,"I find I ask no more than about 25 mins of tech questions, but then drop in stuff like ‘Have you seen the new feature in Node 8, what’s your opinion of async/await versus promises’; (we are mainly a JS environment)"
750,1504737657.000157,Junita,yeah I think that’s a good approach.  give people a topic and let them run with it and they’ll tell you a lot about themselves
750,1504737679.000226,Eve,"I like the async/await vs promises, basically language features, or differences between languages even and get their opinion"
750,1504737693.000127,Junita,I also like to talk to people about projects they’ve worked on in a very conversational manner.  I find it can tell a lot
750,1504737753.000042,Beula,"I usually ask stuff about what they're into, what excites them, their favorite projects they've been on"
750,1504737785.000087,Britteny,"All of the above, yeah.  If they can’t talk coherently about the design choices and trade-offs they’ve made, then they’re not really fluent enough with the tech; For a senior role; I’ve not interviewed for juniors in 10 years, which is a bit sad really as we need to do more of that"
750,1504737858.000189,Junita,interviewing a junior is basically flipping a coin. lol
750,1504738008.000132,Georgiana,"Looks I am the only ""lucky guy"" with questions about big O; and internals of JVM; I am more a Java-developer but also looking for a python role"
750,1504738060.000268,Britteny,"Haha.. wow.  I think it depends on who you interview with.  We’re not trying to be google and have the best engineering team.  We want to solve our customer’s problems, even those they haven’t been able to explain to us"
750,1504738339.000156,Eve,"Big O, algorithms, traverse a binary search tree in order, post order, pre order, but then your role has very little to do with that.  I mean I understand needing to know fundamentals but those questions have always bothered me.; But Java roles seem to like those types of questions."
750,1504738532.000381,Junita,Yeah agreed.  And honestly an interviewer asking those sorts of questions to me is a huge red flag about a place.
750,1504738769.000208,Georgiana,I am ok with questions about datastructs and access/search time because you use datastructs every day
750,1504738828.000066,Junita,"yeah, that’s true, there are.  and that’s actually an important thing as a job seeker.  don’t settle for a place raising a bunch of red flags if possible."
751,1504738731.000223,Georgiana,But there are many red flags though; But writing an optimal solution having 5 minutes when interviewer is near you - it is weird
752,1504741075.000081,Eve,Weird and just not how you do your day to day job.  I'm not what information interviewers think they gleaning from a candidate in those situations.
752,1504741636.000127,Suellen,"it's neither by value, nor by reference"
752,1504742021.00004,Mallie,"That's always been my issue with smaller companies following suit with the ""Google style"" of interviewing blindly. They fail to realize that these methods are essentially an ongoing experiment executed by organizations that can afford teams the size of companies to crunch the data and adjust processes, and absorb high failure rates (and the corresponding cost) because of their revenue per engineer and never-ending pipeline of candidates due to their size. Google and others are quite open about their attempts to quantify hiring and that it isn't a solved problem. It's all fairly interesting, but many people are too quick to get tunnel vision on the ""best practices"" of hiring and make it awful for the company and the candidate in the process, creating a market for interviewing skills that, like timgraf said, have no direct relation to day-to-day work."
752,1504743002.000166,Eve,"I think this was posted to a channel here not too long ago

753,1504748991.000121,Bruno,"even with all ""blockers"" disabled or whatever."
753,1504754711.000052,Lana,"Is there a way to order words in the terminal? (MacOS/Linux)
```
The words looks li
ke this
```
And..
```
I want them
like this
```"
753,1504754868.000011,Bruno,not simply like that.; you can take a list of words and sort them with `sort`. but it simply sorts lines from stdout
753,1504754926.000076,Lana,I think I didn't explain myself
753,1504754932.000121,Bruno,"❯ echo ""a\nc\nb"" | sort
a
b
c"
753,1504755082.000068,Lana,"I want them not ""sorted"" but without splitting them among lines"
753,1504755092.000015,Bruno,ok; can you paste that text in here?
753,1504755190.000024,Lana,"I'll use a lot of texts (actually, it's for a python project I'm working on), use any Bible verse, for example"
753,1504755325.000113,Bruno,"yea just a sec; <@Charles> 
```
❯ echo ""i am blah bla bla words just fill asdf asdf \ndoo"" | tr "" "" ""\n"" | sort | tr ""\n"" "" ""
 am asdf asdf bla bla blah doo fill i just words
```; the command `tr` replaces text.; so make all spaces new lines. then simply `sort` them. then make new lines spaces; but also note in this case, you will end up with a blank line. so you may want to make sure that may not happen.; if possible"
753,1504755731.000101,Lana,"Nope, not working :confused:"
753,1504755750.000072,Bruno,are you on linux or osx?; whats the error?
753,1504755755.000078,Lana,"OSX; I don't want that split:
```
word 1 word 2 wo
rd 3 # I don't w
ant this
==================
word 1 word 2
word 3 # This one
```"
753,1504755893.00007,Bruno,"ok with the above, what is the expected output; so you also want to remove comments after the hash `#` ?"
753,1504755961.000207,Lana,Nope...
753,1504755969.00018,Bruno,oh i see
753,1504755977.000178,Lana,I just want to NOT split the words; That's frustrating for those (including me) who love to read...
753,1504756024.000108,Bruno,"ok. thats going to be harder to do intelligently. since what if those are actually 2 different words; such as is it a new line, or is it a ""word wrap"" which isnt a true new line. but to bash it looks like one.; joining the lines is easy. with simply `tr ""\n"" "" ""` its just where to do it and make sure the split words are kept whole."
753,1504756479.000042,Lana,I tried with `tput rmam`; But Terminal just gone crazy
753,1504756600.000031,Bruno,yea.
753,1504756655.000019,Lana,"*FINAL*: Just came from MacOS Feedback page, looks like I'm not the only one with this issue (There's no possible solution right now in OSX Terminal or xterm for Linux Users)."
753,1504756656.000027,Bruno,unfortunately doing this is easy until you try to keep the words from being split. sorting is the easy part as is joining lines. even in bash.; this isnt a bash issue really. its kind of a machine learning issue. though simple.; as you are trying to detect whole and real words
753,1504756785.000082,Lana,"I'll develop my code to detect the width of the window (In characters) and do the `""\n""`thing when words cannot fill in the current line; hope that works.; Thanks anyway <@Bruno> You made a great effort; You deserve this... :taco: <@Bruno>"
753,1504756858.000014,Bruno,"when the word is split is there never a space after it and only a new line? and when the word is NOT split, is there always a space PLUS a new line?; lol thanks"
753,1504756939.000006,Lana,I don't get it
753,1504756991.00011,Bruno,"if thats the case, you can change all only new lines with nothing, and space newline with space. so 
```
echo ""..."" | tr "" \n"" "" "" | tr ""\n"" """"
```; so. in your example above.; ```
word 1 word 2 wo
rd 3 # I don't 
want this
```; `wo` is split onto a new line from `rd`. and `don't` is split from another whole word `want` only 1 word is being split there, correct?"
753,1504757146.000242,Lana,I think I'm not getting your explanation
753,1504757153.000018,Bruno,"what i mean, if `wo` has no spaces before `rd`, meaning its the same as `wo\nrd`."
753,1504757157.000129,Lana,I just want to disable text-wrapping
753,1504757186.000009,Bruno,"and `don't` and `want` is split with a space AND a new line. so that its actually `don't \nwant`; then you could work with that.; since `SPACE` + `\n` always means whole words.; and `\n` by itself, is a slit word"

758,1504776913.0004,Jon,"Hi!

I've seen online that just importing seaborn automatically makes matplotlib charts look better
Just importing it did not alter the way my charts look

I manually did sns.set_palette('muted') to get my charts to look different
How do I get that shaded background?"
758,1504779828.000174,Meg,"<@Jon> I think matplotlib is not used by most of the people here; for example, the help yesterday from me was entirely from looking at the documentation and some of stackoverflow; so you may have better results with matplotlib related questions on SO, as you did yesterday; unfortunately, we don’t have a data visualization channel, apparently there hasn’t been a need for it"
758,1504779995.000277,Fabiola,"<@Jon> Try 

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```; I'm not familiar with seaborn, so I'm not sure if that's what you want, but you can modify the style of your matplotlib plots in a notebook like this <http://matplotlib.org/users/style_sheets.html>"

759,1504797675.000493,Johana,use upsert
759,1504797699.000492,Orpha,Thanks I'll check it out
759,1504797731.000315,Johana,<https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py#L42-L94>; <@Orpha> :point_up: i have two examples there.
759,1504797836.000736,Orpha,I was looking for more of an add_all replacement 
759,1504797891.000049,Johana,add_all ?
759,1504797986.000182,Orpha,so right now; i have this in a for loop
759,1504798027.000774,Johana,oh you are using the orm.
759,1504798032.000322,Orpha,yea
759,1504798047.000619,Johana,then you will need to use session.merge()
759,1504798048.000183,Orpha,"i can take it out of the loop and use add_all; ok, yea i was looking at that just now; im moving files to s3 and storing url in db, but i have to handle duplicates; just incase #clients"
759,1504798113.000249,Johana,i wouldn’t consider that a bulk insert but ok.
759,1504798120.00042,Orpha,fair enough
759,1504798163.000887,Johana,through the orm you would have to look through all of them and .merge() them to the system.
759,1504798168.000342,Orpha,"i haven’t actually read into it, but im assuming the current way im doing it is bad performance wise"
759,1504798185.000749,Johana,"yea, the fastest thing you’ll get is using the core."
759,1504798205.000588,Orpha,sort of like doing a raw insert in a for loop 1000x times
759,1504798233.000877,Gabriele,Moving the commit out of the loop will likely help a lot
759,1504798243.000856,Johana,yea; it will commit everything at once.; remember that the session is like a recorder.
759,1504798255.0005,Orpha,"yea, that was my other question"
759,1504798268.000403,Johana,it records everything in order and executes everything in that order when you do `session.commit()`
759,1504798283.000317,Orpha,"is it worth doing a list then add all at once then commit, or just move the commit out"
759,1504798293.000019,Gabriele,<@Chu> Why don't you want to use `loads`?
759,1504798299.00011,Johana,your loop above is doing an insert statement for every iteration.
759,1504798350.000222,Chu,"I'm receiveing string from client side and need to store in database as is. But I need to know that my json is valid. (There is no way to make json field in db, too large db under load)"
759,1504798354.000108,Johana,it depends <@Orpha>. how many inserts do you suspect?
759,1504798359.000565,Gabriele,"<@Orpha> If there's no good reason why you need to commit after each one, then don't do it. Usually you would commit after a coherent block of work has been completed. In this case, finishing inserting everything is a logical block of work, I'd say; That doesn't explain why you don't want to use `loads`"
759,1504798424.00027,Chu,It consumes a lot of memory and CPU time in my scale. Looking for optimization.
759,1504798451.000772,Orpha,anywhere from 1 to 7k
759,1504798542.000631,Gabriele,"I don't know of a faster way than to use `loads`, sorry"
759,1504798661.000458,Orpha,moving the commit out throws the duplicate entry error
759,1504798697.000276,Gabriele,the commit won't affect that
759,1504798718.000892,Orpha,well… it does
759,1504798734.000068,Johana,did you try .merge instead of .add?
759,1504798738.000031,Gabriele,"at some point, a commit will happen, and your duplicates will get found"
759,1504798748.000016,Orpha,not yet; only tried moving the commit out
759,1504798787.000166,Gabriele,"moving the commit is to speed things up, that's all"
759,1504798798.000034,Johana,:point_up:
759,1504798802.000483,Orpha,:thumbsup:
759,1504798821.000301,Johana,for ultimate performance gains i urge using the core.; but if that isn’t of utmost importance … carry on.
759,1504798870.000544,Orpha,"not the most important; so merge needs an existing object?; ah, same duplicate error too"
759,1504798932.00039,Johana,i think so.; yea it will need the id of the entity and it will merge the records.
759,1504799000.000063,Orpha,"ah, forget it… ill just leave it as is… it works, and it’s not slow at all… was just bored seeing what other way i could quickly change it to"
759,1504799002.000206,Bruno,argh. i keep getting slow connection and connection errors to websites. happens both at home and work. both of which are pretty fast connections. at least 100mpbs. even google search stalls. some times i have to hit the search button again. not connected to vpn. even in incognito window. and other browsers.

759,1504799089.000117,Johana,check all your network connections for any outgoing tor nodes
759,1504799103.000036,Orpha,^ oh fun
759,1504799155.000394,Johana,it does sound like a dns related thing. if it keeps happening you may want to flush your dns.; maybe even try changing dns servers
759,1504799192.000148,Bruno,flushed.; yea. i may try using googles.
759,1504799232.0001,Orpha,or opendns
759,1504799283.000525,Johana,you may want to even do a traceroute and see what hops you’re taking.; are you on windows?

759,1504800451.000202,Bruno,cool. i havent used that one. i do like vivaldi but the lack of tab sync across devices is a no go for full time usage for me. for personal use at least
759,1504800853.000492,Johana,brave is more security oriented.

761,1504803683.000533,Glinda,Looks like you want a tuple of tuples.; When you're better off using a list of namedtuple; Or any other object that isn't tuple of tuple

761,1504804412.000002,Meg,"I mean, you can do conversion after import, but I don't think the `read_csv` options allow column name case change; I mean, ther eis a `converters` option, but that's just for you to apply functions to convert values in specific columns"
761,1504804478.000145,Glinda,"<@Adrian> this way works really well if you need to keep your items intact.; You can apply a lambda function for pandas on import; <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15799>; ```skipcols = [...]
userows = [...]
read_csv(..., usecols=lambda x: x not in skipcols,
              skiprows=lambda x: x not in userows])```; <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/anonymous-function>

` double = lambda x: x* 2` is equivalent to :

```def double(x):
   return x * 2```"
761,1504804695.00065,Margrett,"Ohh, okay, I can make that work.  didn't realize usecols was that flexible"
761,1504804721.000028,Glinda,It's really amazing; The reason it's better to use a named tuple is you can preserve your relationship between the first and second item. You don't have to worry about inserting in any order. You can also do things like create a dictionary of named tuples.
761,1504804880.000065,Mallie,"<@Adrian> and are you using this for a ChoiceField by chance? It doesn't _have_ to be a tuple I don't think, it just needs to be iterable, so `l` probably works as is"

761,1504805013.000654,Glinda,"Even if it needs to end up being a tuple. It's better to keep it in an some related object until you need to raw tuple.; That way you can have it throw exceptions when you want do :

a, b = item.var1, item.var2  if it tries to unpack a None or wrong object you can catch that exception to prevent an error.; Yeah I have lots of shitty experience with importing terrible pandas csv; csv with variable header location, first few rows with 1,2 columns and the header being at row 10, but row 11 has len(row_10) &lt; len(row_11) and you only want the data that's in that extra row.; Because the developer didn't think naming that column was important."

761,1504805915.000574,Adrian,"Awesome, thaks for that, gonna look into it, sound definitely better what i used :stuck_out_tongue: <@Glinda> :taco:; yeah I used it for a choicefield that was created through a django widget"

I am writing a script that reads from a csv file and gets only the headers and then I need to insert those headers into a table on SQL, but how do I define the datatypes ?
I can only read the header names from csv and not the datatype of each column."
764,1504809233.000171,Glinda,Are you using a python database orm?; why do you need to define data type?

769,1504866565.000127,Sean,"<@Rosalind> did you try to open it up to a 'normal' for loop?; ```
for word in WORD_TOKENS:

        yield Word

Hope this helps"
769,1504866629.00013,Rosalind,Is it the same thing??
769,1504866638.000069,Sean,"yes; but you can use the one liner to create an array variable, ex: ` NON_STOP_WORDS = [Word for Word in WORD_TOKENS if not Word in STOP_WORDS] `"
769,1504866680.000186,Rosalind,How do you actually break it down?
769,1504866684.000262,Fabiola,It's more like a yield than a return; but otherwise spot on
769,1504866699.000237,Sean,"<@Fabiola> thanks; <@Rosalind> you divide it in 3 parts: the _yielding_ part is the first `Word` , then you have the _loop_ `for Word in WORD_TOKENS` and lastly, you have the _condition_ `if not Word in STOP_WORDS`"
769,1504866797.000076,Rosalind,"Because sometimes, there are cases like (word in word_token if not in word_token etc etc; Ohhh!; Word (Yield) for Word (for loop condition); True??"
769,1504866872.000085,Fabiola,`(yield) (for loop) (condition: if True then yield)` does that make sense?
769,1504866896.000001,Rosalind,"Oh man, this is so helpful ,thank you so much sensai!"
769,1504866967.000213,Fabiola,The regular case is `[x for for x in thing]`. Adding the conditional allows you to drop elements if you don't want them.
769,1504866985.000019,Rosalind,"I see, i see"

773,1504881870.00038,Sean,"yeah, both of the 'tests' work; `uwsgi --socket....` and `python foo.py`; afterwards `curl localhost:5000`"

773,1504882003.000018,Sean,same as in the link
773,1504882095.00013,Junita,and the wsgi.py is in the same folder?
773,1504882107.000018,Sean,yes
773,1504882161.000353,Junita,are the paths in the .service file all correct?

773,1504882456.000275,Junita,and when running `sudo systemctl start myproject` you see no errors?

773,1504882676.000654,Junita,and when doing `grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI` you see your server listed?
773,1504882881.000456,Sean,yup
773,1504882930.000203,Junita,and I’m guessing running the syntax error test returns no errors?; and running `sudo systemctl restart nginx` returns no errors?
773,1504882988.000594,Sean,both no errors; umm now it's saying it's running

773,1504883105.000711,Sean,i might be using some firewall or similar but i cant seem to remember what setup i have; `srw-rw----`
773,1504883134.00024,Junita,"no if you are getting the gateway error it’s connecting to nginx on your machine, it’s something about nginx routing to the uwsgi socket; who owns it?"
773,1504883147.000611,Sean,my username and www-data
773,1504883179.000287,Junita,"and your username is the one in here:

773,1504883203.000442,Sean,yes; exactly
773,1504883461.000047,Junita,what happens if in your ini file you change `chmod-socket = 664` and restart it?
773,1504883527.000728,Sean,which command for restart?
773,1504883580.000447,Junita,`sudo systemctl restart myproject`

773,1504884204.00071,Junita,"the port is just like you use connecting via the internet, sockets is a way for interprocess communication locally; in your nginx config, change `uwsgi_pass unix:/home/sammy/myproject/myproject.sock;` to `uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;`; now restart :allthethings:; first `sudo systemctl start myproject`; then `sudo systemctl restart nginx`"

```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api1(api_session):
    return api1(api_session)

def get_api1(api_session):

vs.:
```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api(api_session, api_name):
    return return globals()[api_name](api_session)
```; benefits of the first approach: don't have to remember the API names and intellisense-type completion works in IDEs; benefits of the second: all you have to add is an import, no getters"
776,1504904740.000247,Ciera,why would you want a function that only init a class ?
776,1504904793.000441,Yesenia,"<@Ciera> so we don't have to import the APIs all individually, we can just import one ""importer"" and tell it what we want and it will find it; this is actually used in a fixture for pytest, so we avoid having to make a fixture for every API, just 1 one fixture that can import them all"
776,1504904936.000102,Ciera,I don't know a lot pytest but if you really need it I would say the first one. I'm not a fan of using `globals`
776,1504904955.000411,Yesenia,"me neither, and i hate breaking code completion; argument against me is ""no one should rely on code completion"" :confused:"
776,1504904977.000022,Ciera,or make an `if` statement for each `api_name`
776,1504905003.000331,Beula,"I am kind of with <@Ciera> though i don't love either, myself. In a rare case I have just had a function to init those kinds of things and auto discover them; but that complexity is isolated elsewhere"
776,1504905021.000183,Ciera,"```
def get_api(api_session, api):
  return api(api_session)
```; I would prefer something like that (doesn't really provide anything here but we could imagine there is other param; but then you still need to import the api modules where you call the function"
776,1504905101.000159,Yesenia,yeah the problem is `api` is what there are a lot of
776,1504905117.000359,Beula,Or a dict of mappings
776,1504905144.000173,Ciera,yeah a big if or a dict would be the best imo
776,1504905158.000082,Yesenia,example? not sure i follow
776,1504905159.000253,Beula,"+1 - it's clearer and more explicit; ```
APIS = {
  'v1': ApiV1,
  'v2': ApiV2,

776,1504905415.000024,Beverley,yes let me push this there
776,1504905457.000014,Yesenia,"<@Beula> it allows us to be able to instantiate all APIs from one place, which for testing is nice; otherwise we need a fixture for every single API"

781,1504982206.000096,Ciera,and I think you need to use `proxy_pass` and not `uwsgi_pass`
781,1504982224.000041,Beula,"&gt; The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character; From <https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html>"
781,1504982240.000006,Ciera,it might be working fine like this. It's just that usually 80 is for http and 443 for https
781,1504982263.000034,Sean,"oh, i wanted everything to be https, i found this from some tutorial"
781,1504982264.000054,Qiana,"When you are working with backslash on print, you have to put a second one print('/\\  /\\')"

781,1504982292.000021,Beula,"The short of it is: certain characters have special meanings when escaped and they are escaped with a backslash, so to print a literal backslash you need `print('/\\/\\')`"

781,1504983325.00004,Sean,nothing

781,1504983435.00011,Sean,"trying both; correct dns; the situtation is, i am using the same vps and nginx configuration to serve static files for different dns"

781,1504983481.000004,Sean,i;m using cloudflare as the middleman (now I for this have toggled the middleman part off); let me see
781,1504983504.000052,Ciera,so you have a working nginx on the vps for other domain ?
781,1504983523.000037,Sean,yes; but they're serving static index.html file(s); `sudo netstat -peanut` doesn't even show usage of the port 5k; should i try to go back to the sock usage?
781,1504983660.000128,Ciera,if the curl to the port work it should be fine
781,1504983677.000019,Sean,what do you mean
781,1504983733.000039,Ciera,you said connecting to the port works ?
781,1504983749.000021,Sean,"yes, if i run it manually; should i keep it running manually? is what i meant; _is there a big difference between socks and ports?_"
781,1504983861.000007,Ciera,yeah keep it running manually for now :slightly_smiling_face:
781,1504983866.00003,Sean,i got it working o_O
781,1504983877.000063,Ciera,no not a big difference; sockets are usually a bit faster I believe
781,1504983908.000089,Sean,"i got it working using sock somehow, but there's no ssl now"
781,1504983971.000022,Ciera,to have ssl you need nginx to listen on 80 and redirect to 433 and listen on 433; you can do that like this
781,1504983989.000063,Sean,"is there a default config for this?; thank you, let me try it out"
781,1504984061.000057,Ciera,obviously you need to adapt a bit :slightly_smiling_face:

786,1505051490.000022,Christin,"Hello, 
I'm trying to run this condition `int(np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))) != y` however I've been getting this error for a while and can't seem to debug. I'm new to Python and Numpy. Here's the error: `ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.`

Code: <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>"
786,1505051999.000104,Gabriele,"Probably best to break it down into individual steps so that you can see from the error line number exactly where the problem lies. e.g.:
```
dot = weights.T.dot(points)
sign = np.sign(dot)
int_sign = int(sign)
if int_sign != y:
    # etc
```"
786,1505052192.000098,Christin,<@Gabriele> I can tell that its `np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))`
786,1505052278.000049,Gabriele,"but is it the np.sign call, or the weights.T.dot call?"
786,1505052316.000008,Christin,"Its the .dot; Here's a sample:
```weights = [[ 0.  0.  0.]]
points =  [(array([ 1.        , -0.18592399, -0.14921323]), 1), (array([ 1.        ,  0.63754454,  0.36669891]), 1)]
```"
786,1505052672.000062,Junita,is it expected that the elements in points are arrays?  how was that constructed?  do you know the expected dimensions?
786,1505052740.000072,Christin,"<@Junita> i constructed points using this function:
```def generate_data(self, N):        
        print(""[+] Generating Data.."")
        data = []
        for i in range(N):
            x, y = [np.random.uniform(-1, 1) for i in range(2)]
            points = np.array([1,x,y])
            data.append((points, int(np.sign(self.V.T.dot(points)))))
        return data```"
786,1505052834.000001,Junita,so points is the return value of `generate_data`?
786,1505052856.000039,Christin,Yup; Full code here <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>
786,1505052990.000079,Junita,"so, take this with a grain of salt as I’m a numpy noob myself - but I think the issue here is that you are trying to use a multidimensional array here instead of a numpy matrix"
786,1505053106.000039,Christin,"If I replace np.array with np.matrix `shapes (3,) and (1,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 0) != 1 (dim 0)`; So I guess my vector V is now the problem but I replaced the np.array with np.matrix as well which yields `only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`"
786,1505053462.000037,Junita,"so, you can give a shape to `np.random.uniform`; although I’m not 100% following what you are trying to do - but yeah, I think trying to construct it the way you are is at fault; also, I seem to recall a tip of avoiding rank 1 arrays like that, where it’s better to use a vector (i.e. something of shape (n, 1) vs (n,)"
786,1505054264.000029,Christin,Can't seem to find any solution :confused: <@Junita> <@Gabriele>
787,1505054354.000028,Gabriele,What does the whole traceback look like?
787,1505054546.000035,Christin,"<@Gabriele> ```Traceback (most recent call last):

787,1505054640.000026,Gabriele,"Not as helpful as I'd hoped. I think you just have to make sure that `points` is the same shape and size as `weights.T`. You might want to print both those values out to see what they are, and try and use that information to make the necessary adjustments"
788,1505059193.000079,Betsy,"I have a `pytest` dilemma. I have a a `conftest.py` that's gotten to be pretty huge, since it contains a lot of fixtures (around 1500) lines.

792,1505081353.000122,Meg,AWS S3?; for storage; or do you mean some sort of streaming addition to a server?
792,1505081423.000014,Martha,no I have it locally - we are importing our next batch of contacts - and thats all set up - but im doing a side analysis for our product manager - its techinically only text processing - but im doing it locally and giving him back a list of all the crappy contacts - I have a class I wrote that I use allt he time that determies likely relation between an entity and a url
792,1505081480.000022,Meg,"ok, by streaming, do you mean chunking with `csv`?"
792,1505081501.000062,Martha,yeah - i just want to read in the data and write it back out after running it through one function - i just dont want to read it all into memory

792,1505082296.000011,Martha,what is a good way to measure/test whether or not its properly running (e.g. using or not using a bunch of memory)
792,1505082313.000084,Beula,"Yep, +1 for the csv.reader:

792,1505082359.000006,Beula,it shouldn't since you only have a row at a time
792,1505082389.000011,Betsy,Are you familiar with the concept of generators in python? 
792,1505082411.000026,Martha,kind of - I havent really used them much yet tbh -i would likely use them for csvs but  i usually throw all my massive csv into gocsv
792,1505082421.000026,Betsy,"Or more accurately, an iterator ; Well, the whole concept of an iterator object is that it doesn't hold the data structure in memory, but iterates over the elements per requests, yielding the relevant part ; In case of the csv module, that means that only one line is read into memory each time, and released when the next one is called "
792,1505082520.000076,Martha,thats exactly what I want

792,1505084401.000222,Betsy,"Well you kinda misused the csv module there. You don't need to implement the iterator yourself, reader is already an iterator ; I'm on the phone so forgive the crude syntax :
"
792,1505084431.000085,Martha,oh its fine - i just kind of mashed 2 different functions together lol - open to suggestions/etc that I can fix; I have one that I usually use the csv with haha so I was trying to add the part of that which I like
792,1505084470.000067,Betsy,Well for off you can use `DictReader`that will return a nice dict object per row ; Ah gotcha 
792,1505084502.00004,Martha,basically i want it to write to file in real time - so i can preview results as it is building if needed (which I do a lot); thats the only requirement really for me
792,1505084536.000043,Betsy,Not sure what you mean by real time... 
792,1505084550.00006,Martha,im prob mixing two concepts together - i imagine thats whats wrong here lol

793,1505099274.000154,Kati,I have a problem when trying to use .update on a dict from a json file; It seems to disregard the dict from the json file and replace it with the dict I want to append
793,1505099376.000024,Marcie,<@Kati> use the `+` button to add a code snippet with the code you're having an issue with
793,1505099450.000101,Kati,"It's a bit messy after all the experimenting, but I'll make a clean example and upload it, 2 sec"
793,1505100471.00013,Marcie,"<@Kati> I get back:
```In [14]: a = Example()
{u'posted': {'new_value': {}}}```; which is the expected behaviour; are you expecting something different?"
793,1505100530.000008,Kati,"I want it to append the new value to the already existing dict from the json file; like this 
```{
  ""posted"": {
    ""112asdfasdfas833434000714_207568954"": {},
    ""new_value"": {}
  }
}
```"
793,1505100762.000116,Marcie,"ahh; so `update` is not a deep update, it only does one level of keys, so that entire `posted` key is getting updated with the one from your new json; if you want to update a key inside the dict, just call update on that key's dict; `get_json_dict['posted'].update(my_sec_dict['posted'])`"
793,1505100837.00001,Kati,Aha! It's that simple; Haha had me stuck for hours

794,1505110218.000074,Collette,<@Niki> could be anything. Can you provide more details?
794,1505110262.000017,Niki,of course. It is supposed to be an encrypted e-mail
794,1505110326.000027,Collette,"Anyone can send anything via an e-mail, that's just text"
794,1505110359.000111,Niki,"i mean, is like a encrypted e-mail address; <mailto:foobar@gmail.com|foobar@gmail.com> for example"
794,1505110412.000101,Collette,"e-mail address is just text, it doesn't differ much from ""foobarbuz""; It really could be anything, unless you know _something_; i.e. which program have been used to encrypt that string"
794,1505110469.000123,Niki,that is what i want to find out; i dont need to know the original string
794,1505110486.000169,Collette,You can't. It doesn't work like that.
794,1505110507.000176,Niki,"i need to know if it is md5, base64, sha256.."
794,1505110537.000034,Collette,These aren't encryption algorithms. These are hashing algorithms.
794,1505110614.000063,Niki,"ok; so, is there how to discover which hashing algorightm?"
794,1505110717.000007,Collette,"Only by hand. You should learn about all these algorithms, how they form a hash and why base64 is actually not a hashing algorithm; I can tell that it looks like a base64-encoded string, although the decoding doesn't give me anything remotely useful"
794,1505110889.000115,Niki,"ok. I will do that; but it is definitely not md5, right?"
794,1505110939.000077,Collette,"Yes. md5 is a hex string, it cannot contain letters except for a-f"

813,1505217472.000404,Vada,<@Amalia> assuming you are just generating a db of hashes than yes they will definitely help as you can hash them independently

814,1505220711.000103,Gwenda,"Hey What's up guys ! I have a question regarding testing that's been on my mind lately and I was hoping you could enlighten me. So here goes: How do you effectively test a function that makes a call to a website and returns a response object ? Like in the case of a web scraper for example ? (code sample below); ```

def make_soup(url):
     response = requests.get(url)
     soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text)

make_soup(""<http://google.co.uk>"")

814,1505221105.000164,Ciera,to make sure `request.get` is called with the correct `url` you should mock request for this test
814,1505221129.000202,Luana,I think this package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-mock> may help

```
@pook.get('<https://myurl>')
def test_my_url():
    my_lib_function()

814,1505221501.000178,Beula,"Doesn't that typically depend if the API provides you a ""sandbox"" or demo env?"
814,1505221539.000017,Gabriele,You tell me. :slightly_smiling_face:  This is not an area I work in much. The APIs I use are public ones and I've not encountered that sort of functionality.
814,1505221566.000346,Beula,"Generally speaking, I don't if I don't have a testing env for them due to rate limits and such; I mock all the major response cases so I know if I can handle the error conditions around their API - generally speaking most places are decent about not breaking existing APIs; Assuming their devs are decent, anyway"
814,1505221623.000421,Fabiola,The people I'm working on this with have made some functional tests. I don't know if it's necessary: <https://github.com/keboola/sapi-python-client/tree/master/tests>

814,1505221793.000405,Gabriele,"yup. Unfortunately I refuse to use Google Maps/Places, and Factual are discontinuing their Javascript API in favour of an app that semi-secretly tracks their users, so my options for a public places database are very limited"

815,1505221231.000114,Fabiola,"I haven't used the library recommended by <@Luana> so I can't compare, but the key thing is to mock one way or another. Without mocking, you're not testing your code so much as testing the API / website itself. It makes your tests fragile and slow to run, as network problems will make your tests fail etc."
816,1505221937.000339,Meg,what about mapbox?

817,1505233723.000302,Mary,<@Gabriele> - what about testability? Classes become harder to test because of composition; The only way I could think of making it easier is passing the class as a param on initialization
817,1505233759.000339,Gabriele,"Why? Mixins are just composition that the compiler does for you.; I guess you can't easily pass several different composed types to the same tests, but if you really want the same interface across them, you can add that"
817,1505233825.000513,Beula,"Mixins aren't composition; You can write them as such, but it's still a  ""is-a"" relationship there"
817,1505233841.000302,Gabriele,"Composition is more about aggregating functionality than about interfaces; Well, I'm thinking on a more abstract level. It's still just taking the bits from one thing and inserting them into another. Is-A and Has-A becomes rather fluid in a dynamically typed language anyway"
817,1505233930.000178,Beula,"Not really, inheritance is always ""is-a""; Dynamic doesn't really impact that at all"
817,1505234020.000256,Gabriele,"But you can have ""is-a"" without inheritance, and you can have mixins with all 'private' members which don't really give you any sort of useful 'is-a' relationship.; As I see it, the only really important thing is, ""does this object support this interface?"""
817,1505234070.000166,Beula,"It's not about whether or not you get anything useful from it though; And you are right, that _can_ happen; But that's digressing from mixin not really being composition"
817,1505234226.000706,Gabriele,I still think it's just a matter of perspective.

826,1505295283.00027,Junita,There’s a module for FTP: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html>; tools like fabric are useful though for automating tasks like that

````
Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree.

The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor

of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the

tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left

child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in

the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function

definition should look like question4(T, r, n1, n2), where Tis the tree

represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer

stored in that node and a 1 represents a child node, r is a non-negative integer

representing the root, and n1 and n2 are non-negative integers representing the

two nodes in no particular order. For example, one test case might be ...

833,1505317679.000437,Mavis,"Hi! 
I've stated using SQLAlchemy in my new project and can not exactly get the relationships part.
I have a method which goes over a list of `Candidate` objects, its model has ` applications = relationship('Application', backref='candidate', )` and in that loop I want to merge the Candidate objects to different session. Problem is that it only merges the `Candidates` not the `Application` objects to the other session. I have a feeling that there is a setting that I'm missing either on the merge or model side that would enable saving all of the related models."

As far as the OOP have the same technical mentality?
847,1505393647.00042,Meg,"well, OOP basics are the same regardless of language; jsut Python doesn’t have interfaces; but there are alot of differences"
847,1505393735.000604,Latarsha,"and supports multiple inheritance, while C# does not"
847,1505393737.000189,Meg,not a whole lot of overlap
847,1505393815.000145,Hyun,C#8 is gonna change to multiple inheritance and it gonna have MI and that was my worst nightmare no MI. But Python so versatile and thats what i love; I want slowly to do besides my work python projects from scratch in OOP so i wanted to know if its easy (OOP is the same as you said) . Cuz its easier for someone who doesnt know OOP to start OOP in a new language rather than one who knows from some other language as far as i am concerned :smile:

850,1505408268.00061,Felicita,quick question. How do you convert a string to a date and then substract dates from each other; so 2/2/17 - 2/7/17 will give me 5 days
850,1505408318.000428,Mallie,"<@Felicita> Don't convert it to a string to do any sort of math, you do that with the datetime/date struct; Convert it to string just for presentation"
850,1505408325.000283,Johana,"timedelta and datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’); i think he’s going from string to datetime obj"
850,1505408367.000398,Mallie,"Oh woops I had it backwards, you're right"
850,1505408408.000218,Johana,i’ve provided some tips. try those out and come back with what you have tried :wink:.
850,1505408425.000525,Felicita,"<@Mallie> <@Johana> Yea I needed to convert it to date because I'm getting the date from the front end as strings; <@Johana> yup will give it a shot thanks; end_date = datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’)

SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier; Are there supposed to be spaces?"
850,1505408570.000396,Johana,you may need to adjust your import statement of datetime.; `from datetime import datetime`; something like that
850,1505408613.00046,Gabriele,"Invalid character in identifier... did you copy and paste that line, perhaps?"
850,1505408651.000063,Johana,actually you don’t need timedelta either. i have some code here where i compare dates. i’m not formatting from a string but it shows the general idea: <https://github.com/openstax/research-p3-experiment-4/blob/master/digital_logic/experiment/service.py#L298-L311>
850,1505408655.000579,Felicita,yea I imported it <@Johana>; <@Gabriele> yea I copied it straight. But then I tried typing it
850,1505408708.000443,Gabriele,"The error just looks like maybe you copied a character that doesn't work in Python, that's all"
850,1505408734.000499,Johana,"yea, i got an error on the quotes.; i’ll adjust it"
850,1505408745.000041,Felicita,"<@Johana> Are those date types?; <@Gabriele> Yea probably, let me try type it manually"
850,1505408816.000711,Johana,it’s the quotes for some reason they are jacked up.
850,1505408872.000121,Felicita,just your right it was the quotes just as I finished typing it out too lol <@Johana>
850,1505408879.000343,Johana,and yes those are datetimes.; sqlalchemy takes the datetime field from the database and converts it to a python datetime obj.
850,1505408988.000236,Felicita,the dates actually subtract without any conversions. I just need to convert the result into a readable date now

851,1505411580.000429,Frieda,what led you to finding it?
851,1505411669.000562,Johana,there are some books out there that try to cover the standard lib.; i think there is one called standard lib by example or something like that.; reading source code from many projects helps you learn those things too.
851,1505411725.000296,Frieda,the standard lib is _huge_ so it's really hard to cover the whole thing

853,1505467860.000238,Colene,"Hello! I'd love some help with a mock.patch issue I am having. I am using Django/DRF to run some integration tests. My test is using the http client to make a request to the DRF API. I use service classes inside my API viewset functions to do the bulk of the logic, e.g. I might have a test method that uses `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService', autospec=True)` to mock the UserService class used by the API and this works great. What I am unable to do however is mock the `SMSService` that the `UserService` uses internally. I cannot come up with a `mock.patch` target string that mocks that class. I've tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.SMSService', autospec=True)` but of course `UserService` is a class not a module. I've also tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.login.SMSService', autospec=True)` to target a class function but that also is not doing it. Is this possible - I want the `UserService` code to run during my test but not the `SMSService`.; OK, so actually I was able to do this with a direct patch to `mock.patch('core.services.user_service.SMSService', autospec=True)`"

858,1505505214.000639,Orpha,"yea, you should keep track of transactions; who paid what when; or who was paid what when; depending on the direction of money flow; there are many ways to do that too… basically, it’s a log of what you need or want to track… with any log, the more information you log, the better, because who knows when you need xyz"

858,1505505399.000181,Orpha,"but its still a log, so dont stress about it, you should at minimum track the who was paid what when stuff; yea, you should keep your own log too though"
858,1505505445.00055,Huey,"But the reason I ask is when customers change plans the easiest way for me to do it was to have them cancel their current subscription and sign up for a different one, rather than use the stripe upgrade/downgrade stuff and deal with changing billing cycles etc"
858,1505505458.000127,Orpha,"maybe your system things someone got paid, and stripe doesnt show a refund… this is why you also need a log"
858,1505505459.000151,Huey,"so when I do that and delete the customer to start fresh it wipes their billing history.; ok, cool; I will probably create a payment history table for each user then"
858,1505505512.000043,Orpha,"ah, you should for sure use stripes (or your own) upgrade/downgrade; dont let users cancel then signup again; you will likely lose people that way"

858,1505505586.000137,Orpha,just doesnt sound like the best UX; im no expert though; so yea haha; do you have a subscriptions table?; could you not just ‘on upgrade’ switch the users subscription_id to whatever they changed to; then in transactions log you can also store what subscription they were on at the time of the transaction
858,1505505739.000605,Huey,Yeah I could do that. I might ... this was just the fastest/easiest way I could think to get it working
858,1505505750.0004,Orpha,for sure
858,1505551649.000065,Cristy,"traditionally, this is done by having one list of transactions, and the expenses having a negative value, this way you can just sum one list, it also makes several other common operations much simpler"

I then have a list containing many subclasses: `Track`, I would like to call a function and give the same input ""an image"" to each subclass `Track` by using multiprocessing. 
Currently it is working using: 
```
for i in range(len(listOfTracks)):
    listOfTracks[i].update(image)
```

And then i can extract the information from each Track using a call to `pos = listOfTracks[i].get_position` 

When I'm trying to add multiprocessing to it, I never receive the updated position, but I can see the image I input is different, but it seems like it's not saving or updating as before, since the `Tracks.get_position` call always return the same position.

procs = []

That would be esp. troublesome in the way I stated because I need to restart the celery services when I deploy code (it is a production Django project). I have hooks to reset the service so it'd be great if the functionality existed so I could just delete the right file or run the right command to run the task on startup but not have the interval locked again to always run 1 hour from when it was originally scheduled.; As it is now it is easily worked around by not updating code related to the task during the interval (:00 - :30) every hour, and if the code isn't related, just restarting the services. So it is managed by controlling releases.; But if I did have to make a critical code update to the task, I wish I could just force it to reset after purging the queue."
880,1505835213.000447,Vada,I see two options; 1) You have a check (e.g. a cache lock or anything else) which the task checks - if the lock is active the task dies; 2) The task calls itself on finish - scheduling the next run that way; neither would use beat; I think beat is wrong for this if you want to schedule it from after it runs on startup; and definitely wrong if it cannot run concurrently
880,1505835484.000273,Mallie,"So (2) is interesting - is there a way to do that in celery? I wasn't aware. Like, I could see the end of the task and say `run again in n minutes`? That'd be fine, I thought `celerybeat` was the only option for scheduling"
880,1505835514.000412,Vada,"I've not done it myself, but considering python supports recursion, you should be able to just call the task again"
880,1505835529.000054,Meg,or call an api endpoint for which generates a new task
880,1505835559.000841,Vada,"e.g.

```
@task
def this_task():
    # do stuff
    this_task.delay()
```"
880,1505835589.000577,Meg,"you could also do something at the end of your run like

```
    task = SomeTask()
    task.apply_async(args = args, queue = 'queue')
```"
880,1505835618.000135,Vada,<@Meg> that means you need another task to call that endpoint to trigger the task though :wink:
880,1505835657.000402,Meg,not always
880,1505835670.000375,Mallie,"So I didn't realize
```eta (datetime) – Absolute time and date of when the task should be executed. May not be specified if countdown is also supplied.```
existed, nor `countdown` for that matter"
880,1505835671.000145,Meg,have a view handler; and post to said URL
880,1505835721.000725,Vada,"yep although  if the only reason you are doing it every hour is so it doesn't overlap, you may as well just do the countdown"
880,1505835745.000353,Mallie,Yeah just saw that too hah; I thought the only options were `do now` or `celerybeat` so that's cool
880,1505835825.000398,Vada,<@Meg> but why would that be better than the task calling itself?
880,1505835832.00019,Mallie,<@Vada> :taco:
880,1505835842.000356,Vada,"I mean that is the task calling itself, but via an API endpoint right?; ty <@Mallie>"
880,1505835847.000155,Mallie,If this Slack existed when I first was working with celery would've been great lol
880,1505835847.000222,Meg,"ah, never mind"
880,1505835856.000454,Mallie,Instead of my 7 mo issue and SO question
880,1505835859.000662,Meg,I was thinking recursion depth; and trying to avoid bottoming out
880,1505835875.000686,Vada,Haha I can post an SO response as well if you want
880,1505835884.000119,Meg,"so when a task calls itself, does it get put in the broker?; or does it immediately execute on the same worker"
880,1505835904.000309,Vada,"yeah delay doesn't actually call the task, it posts it to the message broker"
880,1505835915.000437,Meg,"gotcha; ah, then `run` would execute immediately on the worker"
880,1505835927.000461,Vada,so it should become a separate stack - although I'd be very interested/surprised if that isn't the case
880,1505835942.000289,Meg,"FWIW, I prefer `apply_async` vs `delay`"
880,1505835958.000125,Vada,They're essentially the same thing righht?
880,1505835966.000485,Meg,"because it lets me specify the args, queue and any potential tasks to run after sequence; `delay` is a simplified `apply_async` with non-overrideable defaults"
880,1505835994.000025,Vada,"yeah that's true; I default to delay, but use all of them in some places."
880,1505836475.000326,Mallie,"So another question, and this may get more into broker specifics, but does anyone know how celery/RabbitMQ would handle scheduling *a lot* of tasks (30k+)? Right now I update a large number of objects via `requests`, so I just queue them up in order once an hour - that was really the only good option with using `celerybeat`, but with what I just learned, it would be conceivable to set a timeout 60 min from the run time for _each_ object at the startup. Approximately 60 min is/will be sufficient for these objects to update, so the container task to just enqueue them (unscheduled) at the same time has been fine and i wouldn't make things more complicated without a reason. Just wondering how it might handle it if I had an interest in doing it differently in the future, e.g. I wanted objects to update at a different rate. So a few parts:

1) Would it have any issue with retaining an `eta` or `timeout` for a lot of tasks (let's just say 100k)
2) Is there a simple way to inspect if a task is currently scheduled?"
880,1505836563.000679,Vada,"for 2; you mean personally, or by a program?"
880,1505836651.000388,Mallie,"Programmatically, b/c it would basically be `if this object task not scheduled scheduled, schedule this object task` because I would need to run the checker on some interval since objects may be added by users; Then, have the object task schedule its next run when it is done, and so on; I'm not sure if I could do that without tracking state"
880,1505836691.000402,Vada,"so for 1, no it won't have an issue - but you may have a bottleneck in terms of your numbers of workers.; so regardless of ETA; if there aren't enough workers to get the job done, it'll take a while"
880,1505836801.000312,Mallie,"Well now enqueing them all at once only takes about 30 minutes with current config, so I have an external job to check the stats to make sure it doesn't need to be tweaked and so on. Spreading them out would be perfectly acceptable, it was just unmanageable with `celerybeat` obv."
880,1505836814.000059,Vada,for 2) You can check what tasks are in the queue and inspect the workers (e.g. <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html?highlight=revoke#inspecting-workers>)
880,1505836849.000686,Mallie,Ah sick
880,1505836856.000182,Vada,One of the things we have in house is an RSS feed processor which can't be run concurrently; celery has a cookbook for this; <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time>; specific to django; so that is worth looking at as well
880,1505836902.00027,Mallie,Great great <@Vada> :taco:; el dubble taco
880,1505836913.000156,Vada,:slightly_smiling_face:
880,1505836945.00047,Mallie,"That'll be great to consider later if I have an interest in tweaking things for users that may warrant more frequent updates and so on so very cool; The thing I query actually may chance every second, but the 60 minutes is an acceptable ""free"" aggregate update; So that'd be cool to be able to tweak it per-object; And I just added `memcached` a few weeks ago; Also, up to you if you want to nab the question <@Vada>, I think the alternatives you have raised are a good solution; So I'd accept it and you could get them sweet SO duckets"
880,1505837333.000004,Vada,I mean in an ideal world you'd schedule a task every time it updates as a post-commit hook
880,1505837416.000371,Mallie,"Well our deployment isn't based on a repo action - it is rolled into a single command but it requires someone (me) to tell it to release; But if I were to leave `celerybeat` and just make sure each object schedules itself out at end run, if there is a necessary change it would still affect them all after a release so should be fine; Every release I just restart `celerybeat` and `celeryd` in case related code changes - I have never experienced issues there"
880,1505837558.00028,Vada,Post db commit :wink:; not git commit
880,1505837569.000175,Mallie,oh ha

880,1505837630.000317,Mallie,I was a bit confused as to how that'd work lol
880,1505837692.000524,Vada,:stuck_out_tongue:; It would be quite amusing if commiting code affected prod in that way; but not a good idea

It's still a bit confusing to follow, partly because you have commented out code in there which doesn't look like it would ever do the right thing, such as each tracker creating its own Pool, or calling amap which doesn't seem to be a documented function; I'd recommend maybe writing a similar test case where you replace the dlib stuff with a dummy function of your own choosing, and verify whether that works correctly or not. If not, the problem is elsewhere in your code"

894,1505926836.000458,Vita,<@Robbin> Could you give more information like what frameworks you are using or at least where the funciton `get_lines_total` comes from?
894,1505928154.000395,Glinda,"<@Robbin> Can you give some background. It looks like you are using HTML with flask to replace the value within `{{syntax1 + syntax2 }}` but I'm not sure what those two syntaxes are. It looks like job is a class of some sort along with the bitwise or, or maybe you're trying to use python to interface with bash and using the pipe for some other reason. Or you are trying to do some math operation but I'm not really sure."

897,1505981010.000377,Jon,"Hi
How do I get this to work?
```
karee = {'K3 compressors': 'a a a',
         'K4 compressors': ['bbb', 'c cc', 'dd d']}

for k,v in karee.items():
    tag_list = list(v)
    for t in tag_list:
        print(t)
```

It prints the first one as 
```
a

a

a
```

I want it as 
```a a a```"
897,1505981116.000362,Gabriele,"Instead of `list(v)`, you probably want `v.split(' ')`, or similar"
897,1505981144.00029,Jon,"I don't want to split the strings, I want to print them as is"
897,1505981145.000046,Gabriele,"It doesn't help that you have a different data type for K3 and K4... that is going to be awkward; okay, so you want a list with just 1 item in it?; (It should probably be a list in the original data)"
897,1505981232.000108,Jon,"```
karee = {'K3 compressors': 'aaa',
         'K4 compressors': ['bbb', 'ccc', 'ddd']}
```
is also an option


I want to create a function that adds items together.  If there is only one, it should just add that one.
I'm using strings, as I will use those strings to refer to pandas dataframe columns; the strings i put there are just random nonsense now. They can contain any amount and combination of characters"
897,1505981273.000423,Gabriele,"Well, ideally you'd _always_ have lists as the values, so it's unfortunate your data looks like this. But if you can't change that, you'll probably have to inspect the type; e.g. `tag_list = v if isinstance(v, list) else [v]`"
897,1505981315.000211,Jon,"ahh. I'll try that, thanks; It works. Thanks"
898,1505985684.000181,Gwenda,"Hey Everyone ! I got sort of a newbie question related to imports; I've got the following directory structure for my project; ```
├── app.py
├── db.py
├── exceptions.py
├── helpers.py
├── __init__.py
├── requirements.txt
├── tests
│   ├── db_connection.py
│   ├── db_operations.py
│   ├── http_requests.py
│   └── __init__.py
```; what I would like to do is this: from within `tests/db_connection` I want to import db from the top level directory; only problem is when I run `python -m unittest discover` I get an `ImportError` saying that there's no module called `pokemon_scraper.db`; (the project folder is named pokemon_scraper); I have put init.py files inside both directories; not sure what I'm missing; thanks in advance for your precious help :slightly_smiling_face:"
898,1505985990.00015,Gabriele,where do you run that command from?
898,1505986018.000436,Gwenda,from the top level directory; where requirements file is located
898,1505986300.000036,Gabriele,"Hmm, I don't know then. I find Python very awkward for this sort of thing. Often I have to hack in edits to sys.path to get my tests to run.; An expert probably has a better solution though, so hopefully they'll see this"
898,1505986554.000252,Gwenda,yeah it's a very strange behaviour; thanks for your input <@Gabriele>!; yup it was an issue with the unittest package; I switched to nose and now it works fine
898,1505989659.000032,Suellen,:fidget_spinners: pytest :fidget_spinners: only :fidget_spinners:; I'm a kid-these-days
898,1505989744.000058,Gwenda,haha
898,1505989756.000215,Gabriele,I switched to pytest myself. But I run it from Pycharm so I've no idea how it works outside of there
898,1505990176.000323,Junita,"what does pytest do that nose doesn’t?  I feel like I asked this question, got a satisfactory answer, but I’ve forgotten.  :stuck_out_tongue:; I suppose one valid answer is “get actively developed”  :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,1505990223.000201,Collette,"`assert`, fixtures, plugins, parametrized fixtures and test cases, test functions instead of classes...; lots of things, actually; They have only one thing in common: they're both test runners."
898,1505990249.000087,Gabriele,"it has some magic fixture stuff, which looks pretty but which I dislike because of the magicness. But I'm sure it can make for quick test development"
898,1505990308.000282,Suellen,"&gt; dislike because of the magicness; yeah, I hate python, where is my `malloc()` :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,1505990336.000185,Gabriele,Not really the same thing; In this case I'm talking about decorators that magically rewrite things to inject arguments
898,1505990394.000231,Collette,"^ that's my biggest concern, too."
898,1505990403.000067,Suellen,"why magically? they just rewrite things, not magically"
898,1505990420.000115,Collette,I'd rather want to explicitly request fixtures to use in test functions
898,1505990430.000051,Gabriele,"All sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. This is advanced and mostly hidden, so I call it magic; ""explicit is better than implicit"", right?"
898,1505990452.000326,Suellen,"implicit is implicit, not magic :confused:"
898,1505990453.000003,Collette,"i.e. ```
@pytest.use_fixtures('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
def test_stuff(foo, bar, baz):
    assert foo == bar == baz
```"
898,1505990467.000061,Suellen,<@Collette> you can do this :))
898,1505990477.00021,Collette,Link?
898,1505990519.000305,Suellen,<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#usefixtures>
898,1505990540.000225,Collette,It's not the same.
898,1505990571.00018,Junita,"I guess of that list, plugins could be nice"
898,1505990579.000263,Suellen,"in older pytest versions this was the only way, but now you can do it implicitly too
I remember the older tests I've written when there was no fixture injection."
898,1505990584.000214,Junita,the others I seem to be getting away with on my own just fine.  I mean it’s not like I don’t have fixtures.
898,1505990597.000038,Collette,"In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function"
898,1505990620.000214,Junita,"and you could always test functions instead of classes, right?"
898,1505990671.0004,Collette,"<@Junita> what? `nose` is a runner for `unittest.TestCase` cases, you can't write a dedicated test function and expect `nose` to discover it"
898,1505990692.000012,Suellen,"<@Collette> I don't really understand the distinction. In older pytest versions `usefixtures` is the only way to access a fixture in a test function. The result is the same.; Without it you can't do it, with it you can. :confused:"
898,1505990763.000078,Junita,"&gt; Within a test module, functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests
<https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>; I mean, I’ve done it, the docs say it, so you definitely can"
898,1505990866.000009,Collette,"hmm, i guess information in my head is outdated then; but you can't define `setUp`/`tearDown` for these test functions, right?"
898,1505990880.000206,Junita,"yeah maybe at some point in the past you couldn’t, it’s possible; To my knowledge, no.  If I’m going to do `setUp` and `tearDown` I’m going to just use a class"
898,1505990930.000251,Collette,"Right; From my experience, I pretty much always need fixtures/setUp :slightly_smiling_face:; The only exception is test functions in which I test whatever is in a fixture/setUp method"
898,1505991105.000311,Suellen,<@Collette> can you explain how they are different? it's totally lost on me :confused:
898,1505991122.000015,Collette,'they'?
898,1505991216.000249,Suellen,"&gt; In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function; I think I'm missing something, but the behaviour seems identical to me"
898,1505991315.000245,Collette,"I was thinking about the case when ```
@pytest.mark.usefixtures('foo')
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
passes, but ```
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments; I also dislike that whole `pytest.mark` idea. It's so highly dynamic that introspection doesn't work"
898,1505991399.000163,Suellen,"&gt; fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments
It was like that before they decided to make fixtures available by default, which is not really nice... I agree."
898,1505991488.00014,Collette,"Maybe given py3 annotations, we could at least do ```
def test_foo(foo: pytest.fixture)
```..."
898,1505991557.000247,Suellen,"I wish some projects, especially that can hugely benefit from annotations, dropped py2"
898,1505991568.000002,Collette,django? :slightly_smiling_face:
898,1505991655.000294,Suellen,"I have almost zero experience with Django, but if it's anything like Flask then lack of certain py3-only features doesn't really stand in the way too much.
But some flask extensions are py3-only and they use annotations to define endpoints which is really cool if you're designing an API"
898,1505991892.000241,Mariano,On pycharm. Is there a way to see what method will be called when a class inherit from two classes with the same method and no super?
899,1505988196.000016,Junita,"what happens if you try to import from db directly?  I think a lot of the test runners (I’ve never used unittest discover myself, so just speaking generally here) add the root folder to your search path; when you try and import from `pokemon_scraper` you are trying to import from the directory above that; I usually also contain my code within a `src` directory, or something like that, to help keep things tidy, and then import in my tests from `src`; cool.  I *think* nose is on the outs though, right?  I still use it all over the place because I’m old and stubborn, but is it still under active development?; I think the kids these days are using pytest or something similar?; not sure about pycharm, but in the debugger you can look at `__mro__`"

901,1506002867.000497,Gwenda,Anyone familiar with `async/await` ?; I was wondering if it's relevant to use this construct in the context of DB operations; say DB insertion for example
901,1506002950.000162,Gabriele,"It's likely to be an overcomplication unless you truly know that you need it, and even then there are other optimisations to try first"
901,1506002973.000318,Ciera,yeah depends on how things are made.
901,1506002982.000439,Gwenda,what kind of other optimisations ? (out of curiosity)
901,1506002998.000008,Gabriele,Depends on the application
901,1506003003.000159,Ciera,someone wrote an article a bit ago arguing that async for db isn't useful as they are so fast.
901,1506003012.000498,Gabriele,"Maybe you don't need an insert, maybe you can postpone it, maybe you can write to a cache, etc"
901,1506003016.000629,Ciera,but if all your app is async you might as well use it
901,1506003030.00024,Gwenda,ah I see !
901,1506003050.000705,Gabriele,"<@Ciera> I expect you mean this one, by the author of SQLAlchemy - <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>"
901,1506003062.00037,Gwenda,The thing is I failed to find a concrete usage example for async/await
901,1506003074.000396,Gabriele,"I don't agree with all the conclusions, but broadly speaking it's right"
901,1506003074.000409,Gwenda,even for a simple http request to an external service
901,1506003078.000713,Ciera,<@Gabriele> yes thanks :taco:
901,1506003111.000459,Gabriele,"If you have an application that needs to perform slow I/O operations as well as be responsive in some other way, then async operations may be what you need; e.g. I write video games, and I don't want to hang the whole game while we do a Quick Save, because we need to render every 16 or 32 milliseconds. So we do the save asynchronously"

Emacs isn't an IDE persay (though you can customize it to one) but you can do multi-line replace. Visual Studio has an add-on for it I've never tested... For Atom though jkelly's issue tells you the status there."
905,1506020658.000018,Dominick,"<@Mallie> Definitely. I've never used emacs or visual studio actually. Looks like it doesn't quite work in Atom, but Find in Project should suit my needs. More of an exploratory question at this point :slightly_smiling_face:"

931,1506370119.000453,Meg,"anyone here with bulk indexing in solr experience?  I have a project coming up in which I have to index about 10 million web pages on S3 as well as an continual average of 20k or so per week.  Objects in the celery bucket are like `/bucket_name/$db_id/path/to/file.ext`

Distributor task - take in a folder ID and get all html files from the folder, recursively
Single-page index task - Responsible for indexing one single web page, started from parent task above

Using Celery, my workflow is like this:
1. Query db for IDs of records and chunk to distributor celery task
2. Celery task uses `boto3` to get all html files from the S3 `bucket_name/db_id` 'folder'  Puts path in queue for single-page index task
3. Individual page processes and inserts into mysql db table
4. Once all child tasks are finished, parent task triggers a Solr DataImportHandler API call to do a delta-import from the mysql table, which should import all the recently inserted data from mysql into solr
5. After import is complete, delete all imported rows from mysql table; I plan on using at least four distributor workers, and about 20 single page workers, so this can easily overwhelm the solr import API"

934,1506425215.000315,Jorge,"write some condition in while ,eg:; ```while count&lt;0```"
934,1506425421.00033,Chi,"maybe some context would help. the assignment is to recreate the game of “Pig”, human vs computer. player rolls a die, and can keep rolling as many times as they want, and then the other player rolls. first player to 50 wins.  if you roll a 6, your entire score for that round is 0. I’m work on the ask_yes_or_no method, which includes a prompt."
934,1506425930.000054,Ciera,"```
a = True
while a:
  a = False
```"
934,1506426172.000385,Shelly,"<@Chi> if you need to prompt, you can use something like `input(""Enter yes or no"")`"
934,1506426282.000196,Chi,"the code is doing the opposite of what I want it to do.; not sure if it’s appropriate to post the entire thing here (it’s 100 lines); this is the prompt function ```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): 
     roll_again = True
     while roll_again:
          answer = input(prompt)
          if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
              roll_again = False #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?

          else:
               print(""sorry, what was that?"")   
```; when it’s nested in the computer_move method, and i run the program, if I type “no” it loops back and rolls the die again. if i type “yes” it just keeps asking “roll again?”"
934,1506426548.000047,Meg,"so, a while loop looks at the variable sequence and evaluates it to true or false.; you only set `roll_again` once in the loop, and that's when the input is that of 'Yes, I want to roll again'; you should set `roll_again` to be True` in the `if` and `False` in the `elif` block"
934,1506426730.000096,Chi,"```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt):

934,1506426817.000052,Meg,then the issue is whatever else is within the conditionals that you're not posting here; you can post a code snippet by pressing the + at the side of the text entry and selecting `Code or Text Snippet`
934,1506426873.000124,Shelly,<@Chi> I feel like something is missing here
934,1506426928.00032,Chi,ok. this is the whole program so far
934,1506427025.00021,Meg,"so with `ask_yes_or_no`, you're not returning a value there to use within the `while computer:` loop; so you should modify the `ask_yes_or_no` conditionals to

```
if answer.startswith('y') or answer == 'yes':
    return True
elif answer.startswith('n') or answer == 'no':
    return False
else:
   print('Sorry?')
```; because a `return` inside a loop is an implicit break execution"
934,1506427444.000178,Chi,that doesn’t break the loop. it continues to roll the die
934,1506427450.000257,Meg,but I think you have your whole program structured wrong.
934,1506427562.000149,Chi,we have to use the functions provided. starter code of sorts
934,1506427578.00015,Meg,is this intro to programming?

Do you have any idea why? Already went to check the *$sort* operator page on MongoDB manual and although they say it works with two fields, I don't seem to be able to replicate the functionality.

&gt; ""This operation sorts the documents in the users collection, in descending order according by the age field and then in ascending order according to the value in the posts field.""  (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/index.html#ascending-descending-sort>)

956,1506535890.000129,Earline,"<@Winnie> Depends what you mean by “quadratic”, but I assume you mean O(n squared) where you expected O(n)

It goes slowly because of all the string-copying going on: strings are immutable, so the expression `', ' + name` effectively means 
“take a copy of `, `, then copy all of `name` after it”

And then `s += ', ' + name` means:
“take a copy of `s`, then copy the chars in `', '` after it, then copy `name` after that”

As `s` gets longer, it is being copied much more often than needed.
You’d be better off to use `join`, e.g.
```
s = ', '.join(names)
```"
956,1506537769.00071,Carri,"Yes, but it still takes a reasonably ""significant"" amount of time to compile, even when cached. 577ns just to emit the compiled re pattern from cache (752x faster than cold cache)

975,1506693667.000272,Beula,"<@Zaida> The simple answer is to only rely on one machine, if I were you I would just set up a cron job to run on the server. You could use AWS lambda to do it even. If you want to just load from where you are at, I would go with <@Junita> 's option of rsync over ssh (<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-copy-files-with-rsync-over-ssh>); The benefit of rsync is that it only syncs incremental files - so you get a redundancy locally"

975,1506697335.000099,Zaida,"Thanks for the help, man. When you say “Run a chron job on the server” i assume you mean to do the web scraping?
Unfortunately I’ve smashed my head against it but I just can’t get my webscraping to work with my remote server. It’s been a huge sticking point for me, making me spend ~10 minutes a day just to do the web scraping on my machine with Selenium. 
Part of the issue is the site I’m scraping. No API, and to quote a programmer friend who checked it out:
&gt; I don’t see an xml request being made when the export button is clicked so I’m thinking they’re storing the data in cookies via JavaScript and then the export page is reading the cookies on the server side. Or it’s some kind of cool React shit that I don’t know about.

So my selenium script has to click through the buttons one at a time and download a CSV from the site. 
I tried to get it up and going on my ubuntu server, but I couldn’t get firefox up and running well."
975,1506697421.000657,Beula,"Oh, my guess is the issue you are seeing is related to not having a ""virtual framebuffer"" (e.g. the browser needs libs to paint out the screen to work)"
975,1506697665.000552,Zaida,"Interesting… Honestly it’s been over a year since I’ve tried it, so I don’t even recall the errors I was getting.  I might get some time to give it another shot. I think it was something to do with the rendering of images or some kind of color issue, so what you’re saying might be that.; about 30 small CSV files. The results of webscraping that (as of now) can only be done from a local machine and not on my server, unfortunately."

976,1506716201.000297,Antionette,hmmm
976,1506716213.000179,Orpha,but that should be the same
976,1506716214.000094,Antionette,but then if you call `urllib.parse` it doesn't give the attribute error; but then it becomes true right?
976,1506716226.000586,Orpha,as parse wont load for you until after the AttributeError
976,1506716242.000566,Antionette,right
976,1506716302.000514,Orpha,"the original question on this… parse, request, etc… were actually loading on the AttributeError for urllib.foo; its like the interpreter throws the error then loads everything just to make sure"
976,1506716354.000639,Antionette,"yeah I'm seeing the same behaviour; and just to double check, for you/the correct behviour is that you can access `urllib.parse` from the beginning?"

990,1506897522.000046,Mallie,"<@Seema> Without an example there isn't really an answer to that. What is a ""large"" recursion? If a situation fits the use of a generator I know of no particular reason you might want to avoid it. You could check on your system with `import sys; sys.getrecursionlimit()` and if you plan to recurse more than that, it's too much :smile:"

998,1506961060.000127,Rosamaria,"Interesting ok, thanks for the input guys. One more question, not super Flask relevant but:

Do you guys have a good resource / reference on best practices when writing a RESTful backend? 

To clarify, I'm wondering what most people do when 

* a required parameter was not sent
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `422`, but I don't know what the response JSON object should be... maybe `{}`?
* the required parameter that was sent was not found in the DB
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `404`, as the ID was not found, BUT again I don't know what the response JSON object should be..."
998,1506961089.00043,Marcelina,"For RESTful back-end, love both Flask and Eve; Eve I've found forces you to be more precise with what you want; There's a whole schema declaration you're doing and it comes with a MongoDB back-end basically; Flask I've found has more flexibility"

998,1506962072.000009,Meg,"any resources on best practices to filter with optional query parameters without making a mess of code?; I'm working on refactoring an api backend that is pretty messy; downside, there's six possible query parameters I have to account for, and only one is required"
998,1506962777.000501,Mallie,<@Meg> What's it look like (if that is ok)?
998,1506962911.000366,Meg,"and that's _after_ I cleaned it up two years ago.  Before, it was far worse; at this point, I think its highly overcomplicated; and might be a case of lipstick on a pig to move forward without re-evaluating"
998,1506963975.000491,Mallie,"Well `request.GET` permits lookup by key - so why repack them just to check for the one necessary, then just unpack them again anyway? You could just `request.GET.get()` or `[string] in request.GET` and remove most of that top code I'd think. I would check for the required field and leave immediately without any other processing personally. Also, if you want to use **kwargs, you could provide a mapping between kwarg and value then just provide them if they exist, if you are interested in making it more terse, since you are just ANDing things in your filter and exclude cases e.g. 

```
d={'catalog__institution__unitid': 1, 'catalog__institution__name__icontains': 2, 'catalog__institution__status': None}
**dict((key, value) for key,value in d.items() if value)
```

Can't these be grouped into a `filter` too: `Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home')`. I'd only add the verbosity of Q for OR"
998,1506964090.000283,Marcelina,"This section is the most mysterious to me ```    # More custom query for filters
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__institution__state = state)
    custom_query &amp;= Q(Q(flags__gte = 5) &amp; Q(media_type = 'PDF')) | Q(media_type = 'Web') | Q(media_type = 'Multi-Part PDF')
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home') &amp; Q(catalog__cataloglink__name = 'Catalog Home')```; It looks like some bitwise logic"
998,1506964140.000352,Mallie,"In the Django ORM when working with querysets, the bitwise operators are overridden so you can do query building: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects>"

1003,1506981103.000054,Marcelina,"I work for a company that uses a lot of the python scientific packages. We use docker containers for running these packages currently. There are two issues I'm trying to figure out how to solve. First, what's the common methodology for storing/accessing large data locally? The large data is stored in the cloud - we are examining how that is stored right now, but it could be any back-end.
`from data_loader import some_data_set`. would be the ideal line. My thought was to do a staged caching mechanism, e.g. if the data exists locally, use it. If it doesn't, pull it. Has anyone ever stumbled across a design pattern similar to this?

Second, since everything runs inside a docker container, would it really be so wrong to, on program start, if we are not running inside our docker image, start it and redirect everything to run inside it?; 3rd, does anyone have any lessons learned from running their own PyPI server privately?; Finally, does anyone think I ask too many questions?; <@Lawerence> Could you rephrase/expand a little; ?"

I have a twitter API streamer running asynchronously alongside a discord bot, also running with async. Now, when I receive information from twitter, the stream is set to call a function.

Do you think that simply by putting the streamer as a whole into an event loop will fix the problem?; Seems like if I want to run a blocking task I have to use run in executor; Okay thanks; Welp, didn't even realize they had webhooks so I think this shouldn't be too bad"

(y); Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage.."
1021,1507133383.000158,Patty,It won’t be thread-safe given the library it’s built on. Every request will need to have a new httplib2 object

Don't, that is the wrong path here.; Those are not easy problems, you should adjust your program to use the library within the restriction of not being thread safe."
1021,1507133623.000088,Florene,"oh
should i not try to handle the issue ?
i mean - say - i have multiple requests coming in &amp; then i should serve as much requests as possible
and to achieve what i was thinking was to create session/connection whenever the request comes up &amp; processing would happen differently for each requests and each of them will have their own session/connection, right ?"
1021,1507133685.000315,Patty,"basically, if you are using modules that aren’t thread safe, then do not multithread or process them"
1021,1507133763.000019,Florene,"ok.
but that also means - the request serving would be serial &amp; nothing can happen in parallel, right ?"
1021,1507133884.000505,Mallie,"What <@Patty> is saying is don't use the _modules_ incorrectly. You are free to create multithreaded code, but don't use non-threadsafe components across threads.; Just create a new boto3 resource for each thread if that is what you want to do"

In my code, i create connection to google-cloud-compute by creating object like below:
```
compute = discovery.build(""compute"", ""v1"", credentials=credentials)

if i create `discovery.build` for each object ( as in for each request ), that would involve concurrent processing of Cloud Resources, using different resources AND 
with this - would it not fail ? in case if there are lot of requests ?
should there be a limit on how many `discovery.build` my code should fork ?
or there is no limit ?

same question can also be put up as :Should i use counting semaphore or something of that sort ?

My web app has notifications. When a certain global thing is created (e.g new feature added), I want every user to receive a notification.
I’m thinking of passing this message (that a new thing was created) to my `notifications` service, which would use the `Process` class to create a new process and run the function which would iterate through all the users there. Is this alright?"
1026,1507197334.00023,Meg,<@Tatum> I’d just use an async task queue to do that for you
1026,1507197370.000047,Tatum,Ah but I’d run it in a server which already uses some; I figured there’s no sense to add more when I could just spawn another process; Since the work is independant
1026,1507197404.000153,Meg,that’s what an async task queue is for
1026,1507197426.000253,Tatum,"ah f, it’d do it (spawn the process) itself  huh"
1026,1507197457.000057,Meg,"celery has the concept of workers; which are independent processes that pick up jobs from a message queue, execute and then wait for another job to arrive"
1026,1507197536.00027,Tatum,yeah
1026,1507197540.000193,Meg,please don’t make your own unless you _really_ know what you’re doing.  I had to clean up a big mess from a previous dev who tried doing exactly what you’re doing
1026,1507197553.000062,Tatum,You’re completely right; I have celery set up as well; This is just another task
1026,1507197569.000004,Meg,yup :slightly_smiling_face:
1026,1507197575.000139,Tatum,Talk about over-engineering
1026,1507197591.000332,Meg,"now, you’d just have to have your client-side do a poll on an interval to check for notifications"
1026,1507197592.000198,Tatum,"Thanks for clearing this up, I had a hunch it wasn’t the right approach"
1026,1507197596.000003,Meg,":slightly_smiling_face:; somehow, the guy got his version running moderately well, but it didn’t handle issues very well and would consistently crash.  One of the first things I did was bring in Celery into the project and migrate everything over"
1026,1507197704.000085,Tatum,Yeah that’s the thing right? Handling errors and reporting back/retrying adequately
1026,1507197709.000081,Meg,"_much_ more reliable, and you’ve already passed the third hurdle; exactly; that’s the difference between a toy project and something that’s production-ready: how it handles things you don’t expect; so, one area I’m unclear on; are you using polling on the client to check for updates?"
1026,1507197799.000384,Tatum,the client as in who?; the one spawning the task?
1026,1507197831.000273,Meg,"no. you have a web app, so I assume its consuming an API; both browser and mobile capable"
1026,1507197848.00001,Tatum,oh that’s a whole other separate thing
1026,1507197852.000179,Meg,how are you looking for updates in that?; because you can have the notifications in the server
1026,1507197871.000374,Tatum,there’s a specific notifications server which accepts websockets
1026,1507197879.000175,Meg,:thumbsup:
1026,1507197882.000227,Tatum,"it is connected to the main app through RabbitMQ; and is listening for notifications, once it receives one it checks if the recipient is connected and if he is - he receives a notif"
1026,1507197920.000004,Meg,good idea; and you’ve thought it through
1026,1507197928.000174,Tatum,so what the celery task would do is create the `Notification` object and maybe send a message through rabbitmq
1026,1507197943.000082,Meg,are you using rabbit as the backend for celery?
1026,1507197947.000139,Tatum,yeah

1026,1507198002.000084,Meg,"I used rabbit as both the broker and backend in the first iteration; what ended up happening, it was storing the results in memory, as well as the jobs"
1026,1507198035.000343,Tatum,and they got lost? :smile:
1026,1507198040.000001,Meg,"and eventually everything clogged up so the workers weren’t picking up new jobs; yep, and server crashed, everything was lost"
1026,1507198071.000374,Tatum,"wow, how is that scenario not handled; it’s not that hard to predict it clogging up and eating all the memory, wonder why Celery hasn’t done anything about it; AFAIA RabbitMQ has something like durable queues which store the data ?"

1026,1507198376.000093,Meg,"no, return of task; eg, task state, return values, etc"

1026,1507198527.000342,Meg,"gotcha.  I use redis for that, mainly because there are alot of short-term tasks to execute; if I were to use that, the writes to db would be significant; I do have tasks that write to the database; but they do a query and update inside the task, and that’s for the more infrequent, longer-running tasks"

I suggest you read it.

I understand you would like us to help you solve this problem, and we would love to help you. As a result each of us has a duty.

Your duty is to do as much research and work as is possible into the problem area - to really try to understand it and attempt more solutions than simply `clipboard.copy(""abc"")`.

You need to gain a real understanding for the problem you are facing and come up with a plan or two to tackle it - and then attempt those plans. Once you have done that, if you still have issues, you should come to us. Explain what you've tried and, as <@Meg> explained, tell us what roadblock you've hit and why you think you've hit it.

Our duty then is to try and point you in the direction of resources which can help you with the problem - or to explain bugs you've introduced that we can see (because you should share your code so we can see).

If you do not have a coherent or complete plan, or lack the understanding required - we point you in the direction of resources to help you. This is what we have done so far.

What we will not do is solve your issues for you. Firstly because you will not learn as a programmer, your own progression will suffer, and we would not have really helped you in the long term. Secondly, because you are not paying us and we do not have time to solve everyones issues - this is not a crowdsourced development platform.; You have asked for help from us, which is fine. We have offered suggestions to help you help yourself.; Show us you have taken that on board and have tried instead of dismissing it; If you feel you have spent too much time on the problem, take a break and come back another time when you feel ready to try again."
1028,1507214662.000336,Meghan,"Saw this function in a library I use. Curious as to what exactly happens here.

```def redispatch(obj, device_type, session_prep=True):
    """"""Dynamically change Netmiko object's class to proper class.
    Generally used with terminal_server device_type when you need to redispatch after interacting
    with terminal server.

    obj.device_type = device_type
    obj.__class__ = new_class
    if session_prep:
        obj.session_preparation()```

obj is having it's __class__ changed to a new class. What happens when this line is executed? Is it something along the lines of `obj = NewClass()` and in the __init__ will run? Would the init be skipped since this doesn't seem to be instantiating a new instance of an object?; `ssh_dispatcher` returns reference to a class in the above code, not an instance of the class."
1028,1507216931.000415,Mallie,"<@Meghan> It simply changes what `__class__` is, I am quite certain the `__init__` would not be run, since, as you correctly pointed out, this happens when an instance is created.; My guess is that `obj.session_preparation()` sets whatever instance properties are needed that differentiates this class from the original class and the idea is to reduce overhead (so rather than instantiating a new object with all of the data that is needed from this object)."
1028,1507217234.000725,Meghan,I guess I had not imagined that being a thing. May have to give it a try some time.
1028,1507217343.00034,Sirena,seems like it would be a delicate task to make sure `obj.session_preparation()` does everything right. Presumably the old and new classes are expected to be _quite_ similar
1028,1507217364.000444,Meghan,"Yeah, everything is inherited from one class.; It looks like the session_preparation method does stuff like disabling paging and entering into enable mode.; If the class had instance variables that were different i guess they would include them in that method."

1028,1507218349.000099,Kym,"<@Sirena>, you're right. That point still isn't reached.; I've fixed it, though.; line 188; The print('HELLO') I put in the snippet is never reached."
1028,1507218400.000122,Sirena,"yah, didn't really think it was the issue, but figured I'd mention it while I was looking at it"
1028,1507218425.000494,Kym,Wait ...
1028,1507218427.000125,Meghan,Can you give us the snippet htat calls `medxml_to_sqlite`?
1028,1507218442.000463,Vada,<@Kym> the finally will always execute error or not
1028,1507218449.000207,Kym,Yup!
1028,1507218449.000693,Vada,That you don't receive one is odd; as in receive an error
1028,1507218469.000605,Kym,I'll remove the try/except andsee if it shows me something; I'm not passing it though
1028,1507218481.000315,Vada,Yeah that would be best - not good to except Exception
1028,1507218510.000006,Kym,"<@Meghan> medxml_to_sqlite('../data/test.xml','../data/test.sqlite')"
1028,1507218512.000188,Meghan,"Yeah, I'm thinking there is an exception, but the calling function is silently handling it when it is raised."
1028,1507218537.00036,Mallie,Yeah make sure you set your logging to DEBUG for everything if it isn't already
1028,1507218538.000207,Meghan,"The whole function that calls medxml_to_sqlite, if you can."
1028,1507218549.000258,Vada,"also on line 201, keywordslist is undefined; <@Kym> what are you using as your IDE?; Jupyter?"
1028,1507218581.000071,Meghan,"Or, throw in a log.exception at line 247"
1028,1507218599.000161,Kym,Jupyter yup
1028,1507218605.000684,Mallie,If the Exception were hitting there though it'd be raised - you are saying Jupyter is suppressing it?
1028,1507218610.000489,Vada,Never tried jupyter
1028,1507218621.000362,Kym,But it also behaves in the same way on pycharm; Have both
1028,1507218627.000258,Meghan,"Is Jupyter calling that function itself, or is another function calling it?"
1028,1507218637.000182,Vada,But in pycharm the code analysis looks like this:
1028,1507218643.000101,Meghan,"(I've not used Jupyter, so I'm clueless on how it works.)"
1028,1507218651.00081,Vada,"orange = warning, red = error"
1028,1507218657.000392,Kym,Jum ...
1028,1507218663.000144,Vada,and a lot of the warnings are potential errors
1028,1507218665.000742,Meghan,"Yeah, that red is stuff that will break your code."
1028,1507218667.000536,Kym,Mine doesn't show anything.
1028,1507218669.000756,Vada,so might be worth double checking your code
1028,1507218679.000179,Kym,Let me see if I can configure it to show the analysis.
1028,1507218688.000308,Vada,No idea if jupyter does; but I recommend pycharm :wink:; and they support jupyter notebooks; <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-ipython-jupyter-notebook-with-pycharm.html>
1028,1507218733.000736,Mallie,Does Jupyter include an editor? I didn't realize that.
1028,1507218753.000009,Meghan,"I've got to go, but I really think the calling function is ignoring the raised exception, either with suppress or a blanket try/except."
1028,1507218757.000267,Kym,"Yup, is not very good but I like it to scratch stuff and then I try to refactor it in Pycharm; I think this is it:"
1028,1507218791.000823,Mallie,Does it have a hook for like pyflakes or anything? Any kind of syntax checking?
1028,1507218861.000802,Vada,Even if it's not it it's still an issue
1028,1507218871.000562,Kym,"So I'll test two things:; exception being swallowed somehow; perhaps those lines trigger the exception; that's why when I remove set year, day, month execution continues until next assignment"

1028,1507219612.000415,Mallie,"<@Kym> What is the output of `import sys; sys.excepthook`?; In the interpreter where this is happening of course, so however you make that happen in a Jupyter notebook."
1028,1507220805.000431,Kym,"OK:
1. the exception <@Mallie> pointed out was indeed one of the problems. The fact that I tried to set pubdate.year and month triggered the exception ""AttributeError: attribute 'month' of 'datetime.date' objects is not writable"" 
2. Now, the interesting part is why the exception was being ""swallowed."" It was because I put the return clause in the finally block!

1028,1507221116.000242,Sirena,seems like return inside of finally should be discouraged pretty broadly
1028,1507221129.000118,Kym,"Yes, but the docu doesn't say anything.; I'm using python2; <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html>; the only mention of return is the following:; ""A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not.

1028,1507221273.000692,Mallie,But maybe it's not as clear lol
1028,1507221334.000077,Ciera,I mean it's pretty logical it's going to discard one if a second exception is raised in the finally; I don't really see how they could have done different

1028,1507221625.000568,Kym,Good find <@Shavonda>; Bu; But I still believe it should be mentioned in /tutorial/errors
1028,1507221657.000344,Sirena,I agree with you

try:
...
except Exception as e:
raise(e)
finally:
curs.connection.commit()
curs.connection.close()
return len(root.getchildren())

So:

1. A finally clause is always executed **before** leaving the try statement,
- so execution looks like so: try&gt;finally&gt;except
2. whether an exception has occurred or not
- in this case an exception occurred in the try block
3. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause
- in this case the exception wasn't handled by the except clause because there was a finally
4. it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed
- but the finally clause returns, so we leave context and never come back to execute the except block; Jum ... what's the preferred way to suggest changes to the docu?; Pull request?"

1028,1507222235.000055,Sirena,"or at least, that's the way it looks to me; really the more I think about this, the more I think it should be a warning to put return inside finally, but maybe there's a corner case where it's appropriate"
1028,1507222457.000261,Kym,"I agree, <@Sirena>; Regarding the second one I'd still say it's try&gt;except&gt;finally; It says, finally is always executed after try; Otherwise it wouldn't work; I mean, the purpose of finally is to be executed before execution is terminated; and this happens after the raise; no?; Hm ...; What if we do a raise instead of print('two'); ?; Does print('three') happen before th; the raise or after? I think it makes a difference, let me try.; line 7 is never executed; even without the return; which makes sense ... because that's what raise is for; Hm ... the sequence is indeed:
try &gt; except &gt; finally

1030,1507227356.000381,Mallie,"Dunno PyCharm so get another opinion. I do it on the command line personally (and gitlab, github, etc.); But I am mostly comfortable on the command line"
1030,1507227410.000111,Sirena,"try both I would say. command line git isn't what I would call user friendly, but it does give you the most power and flexibility"
1030,1507227413.000202,Mallie,"What matters is concepts, for the most part, so it depends how/where you want to work IMO; If PyCharm abstracts a lot of what git works is _meant_ to do, I'd be kinda meh about that...; But I really doubt that, it's probably just a nice wrapper; I changed that - I mean to imply _why_ VC and not _how_ VC; Though the how is cool; Also if you ever care to contribute to OSS <@Seema> it's obviously essential, plus, as you read diffs and patches and make sense of commits, etc. you'll get better at interpreting/reading code, which is something I know you are working on"

1030,1507227924.000305,Seema,The act of learning the concepts of git and the workflow and then adding a layer of PyCharm learning how to do the things seems to muddy the waters from the first 5 minutes of video watching and post reading.

1030,1507228003.000352,Patty,best README ever; Also <@Seema> the workflow and concepts of git are going to be the same whether they are CLI or in PyCharm
1030,1507228142.000284,Seema,"<@Patty> I get that but the layer of abstraction is a button or interface I would be ""learning"" and I can come back to the later (or not).  The tutorials all have that click here, click there on how to use git in PyCharm."
1030,1507228246.00046,Patty,"It’s just clicks vs. commands. A lot of the naming overlaps as well. In my experience most people get frustrated and move to CLI, which is used more, and has a lot more resources online"
1030,1507228284.000732,Seema,"so...you're suggesting that learning git through PyCharm will not be ""noisy""?"
1030,1507228410.000654,Patty,some things are harder to do than with CLI. personally what i’ve seen from my students was ditching something in a program for CLI so that they are interacting with git a bit more “closely” and it lends to better understanding/learning. It also makes things difficult if you are on a machine without PyCharm; I’ve found that CLI + a GUI tool like SourceTree (if you are a visual person and like to see state of a repo that way) works best
1030,1507228502.000158,Sirena,"yeah, a GUI tool of some kind is important"
1030,1507228544.000132,Patty,depends on the learner and the goals. some people go into SourceTree and then lean on it for a longgg time
1030,1507228558.000034,Sirena,I think git ships with a tool called `gitk` which will provide a minimal GUI; at least in most common packages for git
1030,1507228619.000154,Patty,different packages
1030,1507228651.000139,Mallie,"I don't use a GUI for git day-to-day, and the only ones I ever have were github/gitlab, but everyone is different"
1030,1507228660.000476,Kym,"<@Seema>, I wrote a Git tutorial for me and my friends a while ago. I found most of the documentation online to shallow or to deep. Perhaps it resonates with you:
<https://sentheon.com/blog/easy-git-guide-and-reference-for-the-busy.html>"
1030,1507228680.000096,Seema,"<@Kym> :taco:; off to lunch, laundry, learn, thanks for resource"
1031,1507230511.000021,Dominick,"So I'm falling victim to copying code from SO without understanding how it works. I have this ranking function:

```
def get_ranks(item, dictionary, reverse):
    dictionary_sorted = sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=reverse)
    rank, count, previous, result = 0, 0, None, {}
    for key, num in dictionary_sorted:
        count += 1
        if num != previous:
            rank += count
            previous = num
            count = 0
        result[key] = rank
    return result[item]
```

I have 1,013 key, value pairs in my dictionary. 698 of them have a value of 100 so they should all be ranked #1, then the next non-100 value should be ranked 699. Instead, they're all ranked 698th. Any idea how to get the starting rank at #1 when they're all the same?"
1031,1507230999.000602,Sirena,"I'm confused, are you re-sorting the dictionary every time you ask for one of its entries?; if you pick 3 entries from your dictionary, what output are you expecting, and what are you getting?"
1031,1507231171.000057,Dominick,"Ya - I am re-sorting the dict every time I ask for a rank, which is dumb so i should definitely re-do that.

For example, I have 3 keys, all with scores of 100: `{'key1': 100, 'key2': 100, 'key3': 100, 'key4': 50}`. It's currently returning ranks like 'key1'=3, 'key2'=3, 'key3'=3, 'key4'=4, but I want it as 'key1'=1, 'key2'=1, 'key3'=1, 'key4'=4"
1031,1507231334.000716,Sirena,"when I run that, I get 1,1,1,4"
1031,1507231372.000272,Antionette,<@Sirena> I'm very glad you said that cause I read through the code like 3 times and thought it looked like it was working as wanted; because the rank only updates after a change in value
1031,1507231428.000166,Dominick,"It's strange - it actually works for most of my dicts, but on a couple it gives the behavior I described."
1031,1507231463.000198,Antionette,for the ones where it doesn't work are the values classes instead of a simple data type?
1031,1507231519.000435,Dominick,"Nope...it's a django aggregation (`Avg`).; Of a `FloatField`; When I dumped that same dict to a json and ran the `get_rank` function outside of Django it returned all the 100's as ranking 113...; Ya it's just really long, but I'll post the dict in a snippet.; All those values of 999999 are just there to be ranked last automatically.; 3.5.2; Did you get those same weird results?; well...say there are fifty scores of 100. I want it to rank all those 50 as rank #1, then rank the next highest score of 99.0 (or whatever) as rank #51. Right now it's ranking all those fifty scores of 100 as rank #50, then the next highest score is ranked #51."

1041,1507307719.000115,Winnie,like; I have a function that generates a superclass; is it possible to pass that superclass into the subclass instead or repeating the function and adding more elements?
1041,1507307824.00003,Meg,"uhh, generates a superclass?; I think you’re mixing up OOP basics.; in your init of the subclass, have it take in properties you want set.; superclass should have fields already set via its own init"

1041,1507308020.000099,Winnie,I'm a bit confused; what does passing A into super do?; because the code I'm working on passes B into super (in the B class)

1041,1507308224.000237,Meg,"ok, so B is a subclass of A; and you’re already instanciating properties that B inherits from A; in addition, if you have a method defined in A that’s not replicated in B, its still accessible from B; eg, 

```class A(object):
    def some_func(self, t):  # do something

inst = B(...args)

1041,1507308527.000573,Winnie,make_A parses a json and takes out the appropriate fields to put in the args

B(**make_a(data).variables, data[-1])

1041,1507309494.000006,Sirena,"it looks more like it's accepting a GraphQL object and returning a Group object, but the GraphQL object is mostly just a blob of query data, so it could contain all sorts of things; so this is very similar to a factory, but it uses a bunch of functions rather than a class to determine which object to return; if you have a graphql blob of 'room' data, then adding a graphql_to_room function would make sense, just mimic what's in most of these other functions"
1041,1507309586.000393,Winnie,"yeah; but instead of reapating code, could I get the graphql group function to do some of the work for me?"
1041,1507309670.000595,Sirena,"it would depend on what's in your room data; down at the bottom of your file it defines a bunch of graphql types; there isn't one for a room, but if you add it, then you can query a room; if it is meaningfully related to a group, then you might get the group function to do some work for you"
1041,1507309746.000553,Winnie,"well, a room is just a group with some extra things, so it inherits from it"
1041,1507309758.00002,Sirena,"but assuming a room is not a group with additions, and a group is not a room with additions, it's probably most sensible to write a separate independent function; ah; then yah"

1041,1507310725.000025,Sirena,"yeah, I see why you might want to have some code reuse, and I suppose it's a little bit of a style question, but I think it will end up less readable"

1055,1507386500.000003,Mirian,it should be easy using one of the github api wrappers for Python; e.g. there is PyGithub package; it has method for retrieving all repo related infos <http://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github.html#github.MainClass.Github.get_repo>; I'd start this way
1055,1507386644.000023,Honey,thanks <@Mirian>!; how do I add PyGitHub package in my project? is it just the same way as importing Flask?
1055,1507386713.000011,Mirian,"yes, but you have to install it first (like Flask), so `pip install PyGithub` should work"
1055,1507386761.000063,Honey,Is it not easier to just create my own function? Why do I need to use a library like this?
1055,1507386850.000111,Mirian,"ok, you have two solutions:
- use official github API
- scrape html to retrieve the information you need; I think the first one is easier; so you could just make direct http request or just use python wrapper that I mentioned"
1055,1507386961.000089,Honey,"i like the wrapper I think but it seems like its asking for github username and password ```from github import Github

g = Github(""user"", ""password"")```"
1055,1507386972.000077,Mirian,so definitely you don't need to install anything if you're comfortable with making direct http requests etc.

1055,1507387062.00006,Mirian,"you could use API token I guess (but it should stay secret too); the solution to that is reading from file or environment variables; you could have some json (or other extension) that it's not committed to the repository; so if anyone wants to use your app, he should provide the config with his own credentials"

1071,1507580976.000605,Mohammed,Can any one make a suggestion on how to programmatically test all the import statements in a package?
1071,1507581008.000032,Frieda,test them how?
1071,1507581041.000046,Mohammed,"like look for import errors for example; My challenge is as follows; I have a package that relies on many very different 3rd party modules, in essence - we are building API wrappers, then implementing actions e.g. do something with the API wrapper; some are py2, some are py3; some of these packages don’t work in 2 and 3; so our module, which has all these classes which are wrappers around APIs; get’s picky depending on py2 or 3; so we inadvertently break our import statements; always at the worst time; so - I guess I’m asking how to catch this earlier with testing; I’m fully aware there is probably a better solution to my py2-py3 challenges, and we’ve talk about having a separate package/repo for py2 and py3 code, but I’d prefer not it if possible, but since we aren’t just a small module, we are a framework of integrations, it creates these import challenges that I’m admittedly not an expert on; <@Frieda> did help or make my question more ambigious"
1071,1507581433.000119,Frieda,hmm. you couldn't just figure out which one break on which version and nest their imports under a check against `sys.version_info`?
1071,1507581434.000621,Johnette,"<@Frieda> when I dict convert it what happened was I got a dict with the structure of `{""Keys"":[], ""Value"":[]}`"
1071,1507581462.000304,Mohammed,I’ll add that my module of class wrappers has an __init__.py that has try | except blocks
1071,1507581499.000274,Frieda,non-cross-platform-compatible imports co-existing in a single code base is *_HARD_*
1071,1507581512.000484,Johnette,That was bad english.... I had to convert it to a dict from a defaultdict because thats the dictionary I got back ^
1071,1507581599.000134,Frieda,"<@Johnette> hmm, ok. i'm not sure i follow but if you got it working, great"
1071,1507581632.000505,Mohammed,<@Frieda> yea - that might be a good suggestion
1071,1507581660.000007,Frieda,"<@Mohammed> you could set up tox to test your codebase w/ both py2 and py3, record the failures and start moving them into try/except or if blocks"
1071,1507581665.000063,Johnette,"Yeah it works... just not beautiful, but oh well"
1071,1507581694.000341,Frieda,"<@Johnette> I don't get, say, this line `keys  = dict(d)['Key']`; why convert `d` to a dict to get a key value? you could just do `keys = d['Key']`; `defaultdict`s are still dicts"
1071,1507581855.000635,Johnette,"<@Frieda> you're right, corrected; ```def convertListToDict(tempList):

    d = defaultdict(list)

        for k, v in x.items():
            d[k].append(v)
 
    # Convert default dictionary to dictionary 
    keys  = d['Key']
    value = d['Value']
    returnDict = dict()
    for i in range(0, len(keys)):
        returnDict[keys[i]] = value[i]
    
    return returnDict```"
1071,1507581950.000406,Frieda,"`for i, key in enumerate(keys):`; i might even go further; `return {key: value[i] for i, key in enumerate(keys)}`; just eliminate `returnDict` altogether (also, what's up w/ the camelCase for variable names?)"
1071,1507582103.000163,Johnette,camel case is how the company does it
1071,1507582164.000108,Frieda,ugh; ok
1071,1507582268.000144,Johnette,"This is a lot cleaner ```def convertListToDict(tempList):
    # Convert the dict to default dictionary
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for x in tempList:
        for k, v in x.items():

    keys  = d['Key']
    value = d['Value']
    return {key: value[i] for i, key in enumerate(keys)}```; those are old"

1071,1507582342.000016,Frieda,yeah

1074,1507637687.000169,Meg,"<@Chi>, according to <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>; but it seems to be the file you’re opening doesn’t support UTF enccoding"
1074,1507638848.00016,Young,"It's encoding error. Looks like you are using windows, this only system that uses another encoding by default. So answer above will help. Also, you can explicitly use utf8 by calling
```
import sys  

reload(sys)  
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8')
```"
1075,1507637697.000013,Meg,"&gt;encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings."

1075,1507661897.00013,Shirl,"Good evening! I’m currently working on tkinter UI which takes input from another program running opencv and a lot of video analysis, the output also shown by opencv and matplotlib as a graph. The problem is when i activate my video analysis program, the matplotlib program takes a break and stays inactivate until video analysis program stops. 
I’ve been reading that normal way to solve these kinds of problems is with threading. I don’t know much about advanced python topics yet so i ask does anybody care to show/tell me how structure to a program like that would look like.
Btw, the way i test my code now is by running two different consoles. Where in first console opencv process video and stores data to a txt file while matplotlib running in another console reading that txt file and plotting graphs simultaneously.

1079,1507708875.000218,Leif,Hi there guys! Hey i have a question. Why would i used docker while building a python app web-app? I've read some blogs and they advice to do so due the dependencies. However i haven't been able to find non-hacky way to do it. So should i should i add docker since the bigining of my project or not? Thanks in advance!
1079,1507709029.000024,Young,"At first with docker  you will have same environment for all set up. This is main point because ever if you develop on ubuntu, have staging on ubuntu and production on ubuntu, they are differ and it's to hard for support.

p.s. you can read more in ""The Optimal Django Environment
Setup"" from Two Scoops of Django book."
1079,1507709187.000047,Leif,I see! You are right. Thanks a lot. Is there a good tutorial or book in docker you may recommend aditional to that one?; Thanks a lot!
1079,1507709359.000168,Young,"try to read chapter from book that i mention in previous message. This is good for start. Of course will be better if you buy book for authors support (this is great book, one of the best about Django) or you can search it here <http://gen.lib.rus.ec|gen.lib.rus.ec>"

I'm just learning and i've been looking into flask but i'm really not sure; <@Vada> Oh yeah you are right. Sorry, i totally got that wrong there. I meant that every way i found to go about it was hacky and i'm really not sure about them. Haha. Thanks!"
1079,1507709682.000087,Young,"Flask is a micro framework and you must know a lot things before can build good architecture with it.

But big disclaimer here is that, i know just enough about python and very little about setting up web apps, and i know nothing about Docker. And i really did not know were to start. I might need to study docker more and also the framework i'm going to use. For now i was googling if i should used virtualenv inside of my docker img in a python project.

1089,1507810105.000016,Collette,"If you're assigning a lambda to a variable right away, you'd better write a regular function"
1089,1507810181.000218,Vada,"<@Desire> while this does solve the issue, I agree with <@Collette>, lambdas are not for everyday constant use. You should define a function if possible - not a lambda."
1089,1507810285.000242,Meg,"<@Desire> a lambda is an anonymous function; what you’e doing here is essentially making a named function with a lambda, which is bypassing what it is intended for"

1095,1507838108.000159,Antionette,"Not super familiar with tkinter so this might be off, but fill=X makes the widget as wide as its parent, which in this case is the header, but you are not also filling the header to be as wide as its parent (root).

1102,1507899836.000313,Malorie,<@Meg> already tried those
1102,1507900036.000319,Meg,"part of the problem with converting pdfs is you have to rely on heuristics; since in that file, each and every word there is simply composed of single characters with font, letter and possition information; PDFs don’t have the concept of structure that you can easily parse; unlike word/openoffice documents; so, to be honest, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find a solution to work for all your documents; in fact, I’d be surprised if there’s a better than 90% success rate, particularly giving the sheer variability of ways that PDF authoring software outputs the files"
1102,1507900299.00029,Tandra,ive seen it accomplished with ocr  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytesseract>

1102,1507900327.00031,Tandra,only ever had a play once at reading pdf’s but it worked for me
1102,1507900396.000118,Johana,"there are applications that can help you read pdfs. mayan-edms is an electronic document management system and does ocr on any documents that it imports. you can then use its api to extract data.; <https://www.mayan-edms.com/>; btw, it’s a django app.; the web api uses DRF and swagger."
1102,1507900596.000602,Meg,"so, <@Malorie> there are some options available.  but ‘simple’ is definitely not part of them"
1102,1507900611.000294,Malorie,dont need it super simple; but not so complex that i would rather write my own package; <@Johana>  so i need to figure out how to run electronic document management
1102,1507900738.000248,Johana,"ok so then you would need to deploy mayan-edms. you could use docker, a vps, an old laptop, or install it locally.; you give it a folder to watch and then you drop files in and it will suck them up and create a bunch of metadata you can read about the file.; i keep no paper documents at home. i use mayan-edms to manage all my documents."
1102,1507900880.000386,Ciera,<@Johana> stuff like that look interesting but it seems so hard to maintain
1102,1507900917.000243,Johana,i run the server on an old laptop and haven’t looked at it since lol.
1102,1507900934.000063,Ciera,hmm I should look into that (and buy a scanner :stuck_out_tongue: ); you use it only on a local network ?
1102,1507901039.000297,Johana,"it’s been like 2 years. the funny thing is when i first set it up i was building onto my home and when the contractors and i finished signing all the documents, I told them to hold on one minute. I dropped them in the scanner and mayan-edms automatically brought them up. I have a PC in the living room and brought up the docs for them to see. In other words, i was saying there is no way i’m losing the contract.; yea; you can search for any text and it will find the right doc."
1102,1507901079.00064,Ciera,I'll look into it; just need to find a scanner that can upload to the cloud next; ouh they provide a docker image shouldn't be too hard to put in a VM then

1104,1507905365.00052,Johana,i have no idea.; its for documents so you could move the document from your phone to a folder that mayan is watching.; i don’t think you want to use it for photo management.

1104,1507905446.000329,Johana,but if you took a photo of a document then i would do that; yea i know what you meant. i was just saying that you probably don’t want it watching for every photo.
1104,1507905501.00006,Meghan,"Oh, yeah, not that. I was thinking an app that would take the photo and upload. Not scan all of my photos."
1104,1507905504.000544,Johana,i already use bittorrent sync so i would probably use that.; you could create a folder that bitttorrent sync is keeping up to date that mayan is watching.
1104,1507905529.000177,Meghan,"Yeah, that would work."
1104,1507905546.000459,Johana,you can provide mayan multiple locations for it to watch.; in the background it is all celery tasks.; with a nice web frontend.; <@Meghan> i’m sure there has to be an app b/c it has a really nice web api.

1107,1507916051.000154,Asley,"Hi guys, bit stuck here. Trying to append user input integers into an empty list, and for the program to tell me if the numbers 1,2,3 are in that list. Here’s my code:

```def main():
    print(""This program will ask the user to enter a list of integers and will check if the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are contained within that list."")

    n = eval(input(""How many numbers will the list have?""))

    control = [1, 2, 3]

    A = []

    for i in range (n):

        A.append(input(""Please enter a number: ""))

    if control in A:

        print(""Yes"")

    else:

        print(""No"")

main()```

The program is running, but I think it’s not appending to A, as checking if control is in A for input (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) outputs `no`"
1108,1507916302.000282,Meg,"so you have a list, and you want to see if a value from that list exists in another list?; `in` only works when you have `value’ on the left and an iterable data structure like a list, set, dict, etc on the right"
1108,1507916397.000398,Asley,"I want to see if all values in a list (control) are in another list (the one made of the integers the user inputs); But if I’m not wrong, those inputs should be a list themselves as I am asking for them to be appended; However, I think I’m doing it wrong"
1108,1507916442.00036,Frieda,"`input` will give you strings, so `A` will be a list of strings; while `control` is a list of ints"

1115,1507945431.000048,Meg,Not sure ; Have you looked at pint?; <https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>
1116,1507961206.00001,Glynda,"<@Kenny> some suggestions:
When iterating through the keys of a dictionary, you can write
`for key in dict:`
instead of
`for key in dict.keys():`
If you are using both the key and the value in the loop you may want to consider
`for key, value in dict.items():`

`string[0] == '1'`
feels more natural than
`int(string[0]) == 1`

If you replace the first element of teens with 'ten', you can get simplify parse_two somewhat.

When you are using a list as a constant (like ones, teens, and tens), consider using a tuple instead.

I'd probably move the stringified_int line into the split function and create a new helper function for the building of the string itself. The reason I want to do this is to try to maintain a single level of abstraction in each of our functions.

I think it might be nicer if instead of creating a dictionary with 'hundred', 'thousand', and 'million' as keys, we put them in a list or tuple like you did for ones, teens, and tens.

Here's how it might look: <https://repl.it/McUI>.
Overall, I like your approach and it looks good already! Some of my suggestions might be kind of opinionated."

Thinking about Google Maps APIs but wondering if worth using a standard python solution first. Geopy looked good until I realised it is now unmaintained. Anyone used anything else?
1126,1508164516.000623,Scot,Does anyone have any idea how I could accomplish logging of specific calls and stderr to the same filehandler where stdout are specific log-calls whereas stderr are generic script crashes? I can't get the errors to print to the file correctly...
1126,1508164560.00019,Ciera,Why not use the `logging` module ?
1126,1508164583.000504,Scot,"I am, it's driving me nuts that I can't configure it correctly"
1126,1508164633.000369,Ciera,can you share your config ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1126,1508164657.000209,Scot,"To be honest, what I'm force to now is actually sending all logs to stdout as a downstream program captures the stdout, but I can't get the stderr to be picked up as well...; ```
        root_log = logging.getLogger('')
        root_log.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

        fh = logging.FileHandler('stdout.log')
        fh.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        fh.setFormatter(formatter)
        root_log.addHandler(fh)

        sh = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
        sh.setLevel(<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>)
        sh.setFormatter(formatter)
        root_log.addHandler(sh)
```; tbh, the filehandler could be ignored"
1126,1508164744.000323,Ciera,I thought you wanted to log to a file ?
1126,1508164767.000401,Scot,"As mentioned, a downstream program captures the stdout and writes to file, I was a bit unclear"
1126,1508164768.000778,Ciera,or do you need it to be read by a downstream program ?
1126,1508164790.000267,Scot,It's not by choice I should point out
1126,1508164827.000198,Ciera,I'm sorry but just to be clear. Would logging everything directly to a file be ok ?
1126,1508164840.000305,Scot,It would not in this case
1126,1508164870.000582,Ciera,ok; I'm not sure you can redirect exception output to something else than stderr. You could either read from stdout and stderr in your downstream program or do a big `try` `Except` and `LOG.exception`
1126,1508165074.000302,Scot,I did look at redirecting stderr to stdout but it looked and felt wrong. The downstream program is unfortunately not something I can modify so i'm sort of stuck with this venture
1126,1508165124.00013,Ciera,I would do a big try except then; or maybe someone else as a better idea
1126,1508165132.000719,Sirena,"so I'm confused, you don't want to redirect, but you want your stdout and stderr to go to a file?"
1126,1508165249.000046,Scot,"Currently, all logging is sent to stdout. In the event of a script crash, i need to error to also go to stdout. I'm guessing I need to redirect here, but what I found so far looked really hacky, but I suppose that's the way to do it.; Although, it might not be possible at all without some giant try/except as already mentioned?"
1126,1508165407.000577,Sirena,do you only want error to go to stdout when a script crash occurs?
1126,1508165417.000403,Ciera,"if it's only when your script crash you could do 
```
try:
  main()
Except:
  ...
```; it doesn't feel that hackish to me"
1126,1508165470.000441,Sirena,I agree with <@Ciera>
1126,1508165632.000324,Scot,"I suppose you're right. It just looks like a lot of repeating try/except due to it being a `click` initiated script with increasing numbers of subcommands, where the context class created initiates the logging. Might just be due to my stupid setup but i'll give it a go. Thanks!"
1126,1508165690.000048,Ciera,I'm not entirely familiar with click but maybe you can set it up before calling your subcommands ?; or passing the subcommand as an arg to the try/except func
1126,1508165709.000614,Scot,"Ye, should be doable but then I'd have to break the logging out of the context class; I'll play around with it a bit and see where I end up. Thanks a lot for the input"
1126,1508166442.000115,Meghan,"I've started doing this on scripts to make sure any unhandled exception is in the logs. That way I don't have to rely on users for anything other than emailing me the log. (Haven't automated log uploads yet.)

```
try:
  main()
except Exception:
  log.exception()
```"
1126,1508166630.000808,Scot,"<@Meghan> I'm attempting this now but it seems a bit weird with click and its subcommands; I'm trying to at the top level, but as I said, click seems to be acting weird. Won't return the exception from the subcommand; Where the error should be, I instead get an empty message; It enters the except clause, but my `except Exception as e` gives an empty e; Ah crap, I've gotta run... Wife's gonna murder me if i'm late. Thanks for the input though! I've got some ideas for tomorrow"
1127,1508166489.000302,Marilyn,Why not use opbeat?
1127,1508166575.000463,Meghan,"Never heard of it. What is it?; I've not used click, but I would assume you run a function that dispatches to other functions, right?"
1127,1508166675.000063,Scot,Pretty much yes
1127,1508166683.000015,Meghan,Then wrap that call with the try/except.; You don't get the exception at all then?; What does log.exception() get?
1127,1508166989.000548,Scot,"Wait, I might be the one who effed up..."
1127,1508167202.000175,Marilyn,"<@Meghan>: it's a service that basically does what you are describing, I use it for projects all the time to get better error reporting"
1127,1508167216.000207,Meghan,I'll take a look. Thanks!
1127,1508167570.000259,Seema,Best practices question: It seems that the programmer would have to know that  generator co-routine yields 1 (or other integer) iteration each call but that the generator could be anywhere... is there some sort of good practice/convention for referencing co-routines call on a generator?
1128,1508181837.000339,Rosamond,"<@Seema> You can wrap the generator function in another function, which creates the coroutine, calls next() on it, then returns it, so you don't have to manually call next() after instantiation. The internal generator could be defined anywhere and instantiated inside the wrapper. Is that what you mean?"
1128,1508182783.000037,Seema,"<@Rosamond> Here's an example of a call to a coroutine where the code is right next to the coroutine.  I'm assuming the coroutine could be in any module/namespace.  Is that true?
```def fibonacci_co():
    current = 0
    next = 1

    while True:
        current, next = next, next + current
        yield current

for n in fibonacci_co():
    if n &gt; 1000:
        break

    print(n, end=', ')```; if fibonacci_co or any co-routine can be somewhere else, how would programmer/user know that it would have to be iterated."
1128,1508183055.000498,Rosamond,"I would still call that a generator function since it's only yielding results, a coroutine can take arguments for each iteration and usually has an opening `yield` in the definition.; That's moreso what I mean. Then _coroutine could be defined anywhere. If in another namespace, just import it"
1128,1508183185.000319,Seema,"I'm under the impression that coroutines are just a special type of generator, is that right?"
1128,1508183215.000277,Rosamond,"Yeah, maybe more meaningful to say a generator is half of a coroutine :slightly_smiling_face:"
1128,1508183315.000547,Seema,"and the coroutine has a next and a generator object and ""advances"" each yield.  My question is that if this was imported and the function was consumed, how do they know it's a co-routine other than print(""Created coroutine."") and print(f""_coroutine({data})"")"
1128,1508183335.000407,Winnifred,"<@Seema>, hope that the dev provides doc strings"
1128,1508183355.000261,Seema,<@Winnifred> I think you get the gist of my question :wink:
1128,1508183364.000358,Rosamond,"That, and if you dir(coroutine()) it should have a send member."
1128,1508183378.000259,Seema,"wow, ouch, umm... okay, thanks for tip; will it have a next() or is that only in the generator object?"
1128,1508183409.000576,Rosamond,Yeah. The agony and ecstacy of dynamic typing ha
1128,1508183482.000182,Seema,Time to poke and prod and learn
1128,1508183505.000176,Rosamond,Looks like there's an 'isgeneratorfunction()' in the inspect module; to take out the guesswork :slightly_smiling_face:
1128,1508183565.000016,Winnifred,Lol
1128,1508183651.000111,Rosamond,"As far as next().. to my knowledge send() replaces it, however there may be cases where you send a single item and yield multiple outputs; So next may be used there?"

1136,1508255824.000752,Johana,start learning the core. it will not be that hard of a jump knowing the ORM. the ORM is built on the core which at its heart is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for SQL that is written in python. The syntax is really similar to what SQL statements look like. When you feel comfortable writing SQL core queries then you can answer confidently that maybe you don’t have a lot of experience writing raw sql b/c you like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection. You can also say with confidence you understand what makes up SQL and don’t think it would be difficult to learn since you know sqlalchemy core and orm.
1136,1508255913.000107,Winnifred,and to add a nice resource to practice …; <http://sqlzoo.net/>
1136,1508255963.00094,Johana,SQLAlchemy is a very useful abstraction layer on top of the database. I’m sort of the opposite. I came into SQLAlchemy from the database world so I had already nearly written applications in raw SQL. That’s one of the reasons I found Python. I needed more power!; you can also dump the sqlalchemy queries and study them.; i gotz all sorts of sqlalchemy tricks in here: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py>; I’ve done plenty of interviews where i may not have been an expert on many parts of the job but if i was able to display with confidence my capability to adapt and learn then that made all the difference.
1136,1508256182.000215,Kenny,"Awesome! Thanks <@Johana> for those ideas and <@Winnifred> for that resource.; Yeah, that's what I'm banking on here. I have a foundation to work from at least, but depending on how long it takes from resume submission to phone interview, I just wanted to have _something_ to say"
1136,1508256450.000183,Johana,"yea, the safe answer is typically, “i like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection, like sqlalchemy which i’ve done …. yada yada .”; sqlalchemy is a cool toolkit as it doesn’t hide too much of the database away. in other ecosystems a lot of devs don’t even know what the db schema looks like.; cough* .NET"
1136,1508256775.000211,Suellen,h i b e r n a t e; I love SQLA for this. Once I saw that m2m tables are not abstracted away I fell for Alchemy hard..
1136,1508256920.00032,Johana,"yea, when i was instantly talking to the database and being productive i was sold. i gotta admit though it changes your thinking. when you come strictly from the db world you think about data as sets. You don’t think about working at the individual row level and iterating. Then when you get into programming it flips your mindset.; the last thing you want is a cursor b/c it’s slow."
1136,1508257383.000683,Mallie,"That may not change your self-assessment of SQL skillz, nor should it, but chances are they will ask a handful of things that are easily covered by those sorts of resources"
1137,1508256467.000754,Suellen,dbapi? :stuck_out_tongue:
1137,1508257344.000243,Mallie,<@Kenny> You could also review some SQL interview questions and do some SQL problems on Hacker Rank or something. It's unlikely anything will get much deeper than what you could get out of playing around with that stuff for a bit
1138,1508262907.000147,Meghan,I've yet to use SQL Alchemy. Is an ORM really that much better than just writing SQL?
1138,1508262938.000094,Meg,"for about 80-90% of the stuff you do, yeah; but there are cases where raw sql is better; especially with optimized queries and such.  in addition, some ORMs can create lots of duplicate queries during the compilation process"
1138,1508263074.000282,Meghan,What is the advantage of it?
1138,1508263087.000255,Meg,ease of use; makes quite a few things easier when executing queries
1138,1508263172.000556,Meghan,Interesting. May have to give it a try some time. Since we've switched to DreamFactory I'm usually just calling a stored procedure through a rest api.
1138,1508263202.000249,Meg,then you gotta write that query…
1138,1508263222.000089,Meghan,Yes. Most of them are easy though.
1138,1508263244.000651,Meg,"I mean, I wouldn’t want to write this query out by hand"
1138,1508263256.000431,Meghan,"Most of our data isn't all that relational. Lots of small projects with hundreds of thousands of records, but relatively flat.; Haha, nah, no interest in writing that."
1138,1508263317.000432,Meg,"with that, its basically fifteen lines in Django ORM,"
1138,1508263326.000284,Winnifred,how many records is that ?
1138,1508263354.000014,Meg,me or <@Meghan>?
1138,1508263385.00059,Winnifred,"Sorry, you, should have specified :slightly_smiling_face:"
1138,1508263406.000083,Meg,"hmm, small database but with plenty of tables; so, for this particular query, it aggregates over about 8k rows"
1138,1508263475.000083,Winnifred,"ah, gotcha"
1138,1508263499.000296,Meg,so I basically made a model manager in django; created a metrics method to aggregate; and I pass in extra fields in a dict with the evaluation to occur
1138,1508263623.000094,Patty,i’d like to write that just to reminisce on my T-SQL and PL/SQL days
1138,1508263635.000234,Meg,masochist :smile:
1138,1508263741.000662,Meghan,Should the ORM create the schema or is it better to adapt to an existing one?
1138,1508263763.000466,Meg,you can do both; django will let you create models from an existing schema; or you can create it from your model definition
1138,1508264037.000348,Winnifred,"<@Meg>, do you cache a lot of your queries?"
1138,1508264116.000001,Meg,yes; and profile; `django-silk` really comes in handy; but caching is a little tricky because you basically have to try to strike a happy medium between cache lifetime and new data
1138,1508264329.000505,Winnifred,"ah, nice, I need to figure out efficient caching"
1138,1508264412.000092,Meg,what are you using?
1138,1508264481.000344,Winnifred,"no current projects right now, but I was running into problems with ORMs and large queries out of a redshift  instance; but I think this is because I hadn’t transformed the data enough to get the data to a point where it requires a simple query"
1138,1508264670.000239,Meg,hahaha; how can you ask for more?
1138,1508264788.000345,Mallie,would definitely give it a :thumbsup:
1138,1508264898.000289,Frieda,"sure, you just have to consume it first"
1138,1508264963.000615,Amie,In what manner <@Frieda>
1138,1508265021.000456,Frieda,"if it really is a generator object, you should be able to consume it to a list or a string or whatever (list is probably safest) and then print that"
1138,1508265049.000099,Meghan,Assuming of course it doesn't generate infinitely. I think list(generator) would be bad if that were the case. :wink:
1138,1508265056.000271,Amie,"Yeah I tried to consume to list, and that did not work. Perhaps not truly a generator object?"
1138,1508265087.000281,Frieda,look it up in the source and see what's actually being returned? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1138,1508265169.000039,Winnifred,"yeah, I fired that off a bit prematurely, sorry"
1138,1508265200.00029,Sirena,"generators are permitted to never halt; or, finish, whatever you want to call it; you could print out the next() item from a generator, or do it a few times; SO suggests one possible alternative:
```g1 = gen()

1138,1508265441.000289,Patty,<@Amie> what made you think its a generator to begin with?

1142,1508282833.00006,Frieda,it's not?; python's packaging works. `serverless.yml` is the one doing it weird

1142,1508282887.000079,Frieda,"i mean, sure, maybe? you could add each directory in `packages` to the `PYTHONPATH`?"
1142,1508282908.000176,Cordie,ok that will be difficult. These files are going to run on AWS ec2
1142,1508282932.000326,Frieda,there's a whole `os` module that can find the directories without you knowing exactly where they are. or even what exists.

1142,1508283064.000222,Cordie,ok I am not going to explain why ... exactly this happened. But the gist is that pip installed libraries don't compile well under amazon linux. So I had to docker in and do some bs to download compilable libraries. but... anyway the end result is the folder structure above. I don't want to move them under team_configs folder since than I will have to make copy of psycopg2 for every other python files too.

Armin kept repeating over and over for them to do the tutorial and they didn’t seem to want to try to understand. i eventually ended up with a headache b/c the guy was being so difficult and didn’t want to try any suggestions. I was impressed with how patient he was and it left an impression on me since i was just getting into Flask and saw the author himself helping someone who was being difficult and never losing their cool.; and after that day i saw armin like one other time, lol."
1147,1508341523.000145,Vita,"0_o really cool of the author to do that, suprising the guy wouldnt listen to the AUTHOR of the framework"

1147,1508341616.000153,Vita,Lol considering watching your patience with all of us in the <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel that makes me kinda cringe at the thought of hwo bad it was
1147,1508341654.000085,Johana,"haha, like i said. he left an impression on me and now i try to take the patient approach."
1147,1508341686.00021,Vita,Nice!
1147,1508341689.000311,Johana,i guess i was really amazed that he would even take the time to help.
1147,1508341773.00043,Vita,It does say a lot about the guy willing to help a total beginner on it
1147,1508342058.000568,Johana,"he’s a pretty interesting guy. i tried to ask him a lot of questions about his decisions in flask whenever i did get a chance to see him. He always gave these very simple yet cryptic replies. One time I asked kinda a silly question b/c i was a newb but impressed with the flexibility of Flask. I asked him what I could read, learn, or do to write applications that were extensible and flexible. He wrote back, “Don’t write software that isn’t flexible.” At the time I was confused and like “oh … ok”… but now I know what he meant and in the end it was a pretty good answer."
1147,1508342098.000538,Vita,Lol nice :joy:
1147,1508342101.000553,Vada,"I feel like that should be followed with a ""But don't write software that is too flexible"""
1147,1508342106.00048,Johana,lol; which can be a shortcoming for flask sometimes; he later wrote me back saying he sometimes has trouble articulating his thoughts (i was very surprised by that b/c his writing is good) and that I should ensure that my stuff has a lot of “hooks”.; i spent a lot of time looking up what hooks were lol.
1147,1508342293.000034,Sirena,"""Don't write software that isn't flexible"" is itself a pretty flexible answer."
1147,1508342312.000015,Vada,I like the hooks line though
1147,1508342314.000267,Johana,i may have used the word extensible and not flexible but whatevs; it was a number of years ago.
1147,1508342354.000033,Vada,I don't often think of my code in terms of events but it's probably worth putting myself in that mindset more

1148,1508343721.000219,Winnifred,do table columns and csv headers have same name or are they similar?
1148,1508343745.000222,Beula,"Not always, but I just expanded it to default to the same if no `csv_to_col` is set on the class; Because that is serving as a mapping of csv row to the db row"

1148,1508344037.000237,Beula,Yep! Psycopg2 has a NamedTupleCursor; also a dictcursor
1148,1508344104.000349,Ronni,it made a lot more sense in my case b/c with Django as the intermediary the model class can still be the source of truth - I later created a module that uses the ModelForm so it can validate and coerce as necessary as well

1150,1508404034.000359,Arlean,"hello, people!
i am starting to use `pytest` for a project and trying to get my head around the best and correct design patterns of using fixtures.
specifically, i have a couple of questions:
1. if i want to have a fixture that can serve both a single test at function scope and a bunch of tests in a class/module scope (determined by command line option at runtime) - shall i create 2 fixtures that provide basically the same dependency (a Class instance, that prepares and exposes a resource I'm testing) but each decorated with different scope? what is the best way to tackle this?
2. is it common practice to use the request.config as a place to store shared data that can be accessed by different fixtures? what is the better way?

thanks for any help in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:
p.s.
are you familiar with any open source projects that leverage pytest extensively - for more than just unit tests, with complex fixtures that uses other fixtures, etc... so one could learn from?"
1150,1508404503.000176,Collette,"<@Arlean> 1. Why? Do you have an example?
2. I'd use a shared session-scoped fixture instead"
1151,1508408567.000181,Ronald,"I am using the open() function to append a file however, this function creates a new file if it does not exist. How do I disable this part. I only want to append existing files and not create new ones if they aren't available. Any help would be much appreciated"
1151,1508408717.00035,Meg,check if a file exists first; then open it
1151,1508408741.000148,Scot,use `os.path.isfile()`; for checking existence
1151,1508408793.000167,Meg,"or `os.path.exists()`  

they basically do the same thing here"
1151,1508408857.000147,Scot,When would i use `exist` over `isfile` ?; Works for directories as well I see
1151,1508409004.000071,Meg,"correct; so, its a bit of duplicate functionality; `isfile` would work for a path to a file, `isdir` is for a path to a directory; `exists` covers both, with some potential issues of permissions"
1151,1508409095.000386,Collette,"I'd rather go with ```
try:
    with open(filename, 'r+') as f:
        f.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to the end of the file
        # proceed with reading/writing
except FileNotFoundError:
    pass
```; `os.path.exists` and `os.path.isfile` are both error-prone to race conditions"
1151,1508409177.000001,Scot,"Seems a bit of an overkill for most of my purposes, but good to know..."
1151,1508409283.00021,Collette,"```
import os
if os.path.exists(filename):
    with open(filename, 'a+') as f:

1151,1508409407.000216,Scot,Enlighten a dummy: Any penalty to speed using `seek`? My files are in the 10-100Gb sizes from time to time
1151,1508409651.000314,Gabriele,"You need to be at the end of the file if you want to append, so it's doing nothing that wouldn't already be done"
1151,1508409744.000251,Collette,"<@Scot> CPython calls `lseek` with `whence=SEEK_END`
<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/_io/fileio.c#L908>"
1151,1508409755.000162,Scot,I suspect I may have misunderstood the intent of the `seek` way of doing it from the get-go. Understood it as a general better replacement to using `os.path.isfile`
1151,1508409930.000284,Collette,"No, `seek` is a way to move the current file pointer over the file as you wish"
1151,1508415001.000172,Arlean,"<@Collette> - thanks for suggestions. have some followup questions though:
1. example? I want a fixture that sets up some Server and then test it - either by providing a fresh Server instance to every test (function scope) or by reusing the same Server for a bunch of tests (class scope) - the Server setting up fixture is the same - the usage is different. 
my idea was to have:
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def server_for_single_test():
   return Server()

@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def server_for_tests_in_class():
    return Server()
```
but this feels rather redundant, no?

2. regarding the pytest shared session fixture suggestion...
wouldn't this mean i'd need to have every fixture define it in it's args?
```
def fixture_a(request, shared_state, ...):
    pass
```
no way to avoid this? feels like autouse wouldn't fit here as i need access to the shared_state instance somehow"
1151,1508415324.000157,Collette,"<@Arlean> 
1. Yeah, I got what you meant. But _why_ do you need this? What problem you're trying to solve with that?
2. Yes. Just like you'll need `request` fixture requested in every single test"
1151,1508415733.000282,Arlean,"<@Collette> 
it is not really a problem, more a constraint.
* the Server I'm testing takes a while to bring up and configure, so I would like to minimize this time during tests and have multiple tests run against same Server
* on the other hand, some tests are more destructive than others and might affect other tests if they run against the same Server - so I would like to have them run separately
* in addition, would like to have the option to decide on which way to run from command line flag and not for example forcing all tests be in classes even if they are classes of single test

hope this makes sense; oh, and for 2. there is a workaround:
```
import pytest
...
def some_test_or_fixture(request):  
    assert pytest.config == request.config
```
so i do not *have* to pass request just for some shared data"
1151,1508415982.000115,Collette,"Alright. I'd put these two kinds of tests into separate folders, with different fixtures, and run them like `pytest tests/shared` and `pytest tests/destructive`; To me a cli switch is not enough when doing destructive things. I think you have to be explicit about what you're doing, and it's better to minimize the possibility of running a wrong suite; Anyway, I'd go with two different fixtures"

1153,1508424714.000406,Meghan,Did you look at the SO post I shared? It can be done with the aenum library.; Because you can add to a dictionary as you go and can address it by key.
1153,1508424790.000105,Winnie,"but I don't really need to address it by key
It's just a unified structure to store a colour

1153,1508424989.000372,Scot,"Should a custom given, non-existent color code result in it being stored under a unique ID for further use alongside other new custom colors?"
1153,1508425007.000046,Collette,<@Winnie> it sounds like you need a mapping between color names and some sort of values. A dictionary can be used to implement such mapping very easy
1153,1508425063.000792,Sirena,"I came to Python from C/C++ so I tend to shy away from assigning real meaning to the value of an enum. Whether or not that is idiomatic in python I'm not sure, but I feel like it's a behavior that's unlikely to backfire on me. Dictionaries are meant to map from one piece of info to another which sounds more appropriate for your situation. Enums work best when they are compared with each other but not really used as substitute numbers or substitute strings. That's not to say it's the only way to use them, but it seems the most resilient way"
1153,1508425105.000766,Meghan,"Yeah, once the value matters it should be a dict."
1153,1508425140.000445,Winnie,"well the thing is that there's only ever one reference to a colour name in the code

1153,1508425211.000812,Winnie,actually
1153,1508425235.000848,Sirena,"and you can still make it work if you really want, but it will involve a lot of branching depending on whether your enum is custom or not"
1153,1508425243.000323,Winnie,an enum kinda fits because the user should only be able to provide the given values in the enum
1153,1508425380.000255,Scot,why not reverse the key:value to value:key and run a dict lookup?
1153,1508425380.000554,Collette,<@Winnie> don't you think that contradicts to what you've said earlier?
1153,1508425404.000443,Winnie,disclaimer: it's 2am here
1153,1508425411.000124,Sirena,"I'm confused, if the user only gets to use the provided values, why do you need custom at all?"
1153,1508425577.001052,Winnie,"okay I think it might be easier to give the longer story
so I'm working on the fbchat module, which interfaces with messenger
messenger would allow you to configure colours given a set ammount
but there was a point where you could just make a get request for any colour
so now I have a facebook chat with a black chat bubble
now fbchat attempts to read in the colour to its pre-defined enum
but now, messenger has made it such that you can no longer make a get request with any colour; so the module needs to be able to accept any colour from a chat
but we need to tell users that only these colours in this enum can be actually sent; so what I'm thinking is to re-factor such that on return of a colour, a string is given instead of a ThreadColor object, but on sending, a user must give a ThreadColor object"
1153,1508425691.000026,Sirena,"so it gets the color options from messenger, and offers just those to the user?"
1153,1508425716.000264,Winnie,yes; yes
1153,1508425822.000461,Sirena,would it work to build a dict from the messenger data and then just catch a KeyError if the user gives something not in the dict?

1153,1508426044.000447,Antionette,Might be able to build off of something like this:; if you can somehow find way to get val be a color instead of just the int
1153,1508426167.000074,Winnie,<@Antionette> you'd just pass the string instead
1153,1508426182.000219,Antionette,well I meant an instance of `Color`; right now the newly added values are different from the values created when the Enum is instantiated
1153,1508426219.000038,Winnie,howso
1153,1508426240.000808,Antionette,ie in the example that gets printed Color(2) is Color.RED but Color(3) is Custom3 rather than Color.Custom3; it points to just the name rather than a `Color` with the correct name
1153,1508426295.000151,Winnie,right; it's probably better to use extend_enum in that case

1159,1508433621.000417,Sirena,"<@Kellye> what would you do with the .pyi files after you imported them? In most senses compilation time _is_ runtime, and .pyi is mostly just used for static analysis AFAIK; from PEP484:
&gt;&gt;&gt;While stub files are syntactically valid Python modules, they use the .pyi extension to make it possible to maintain stub files in the same directory as the corresponding real module. This also reinforces the notion that no runtime behavior should be expected of stub files."
1160,1508434024.000028,Kellye,"<@Sirena> 
that's true, that's why I need them, I want to use custom types from *.pyi files as contracts to function calls. For example defining custom model like
``` class MyModel:
   myProperty:int
```
then I could use it as parameter type in function. I assume mypy can detect that anonymous object follow contract of that virtual type from *.pyi file. like:
`def func(value:MyModel) ...`
then calling it like
`func({""myProperty"":1});`"
1160,1508434287.000066,Sirena,"I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that .pyi does not enforce a contract like that during run time; if you want to enforce it, you need
```def func(arg1):
  if not isinstance(arg1, classname):
    raise TypeError('received incorrect type in argument 1')```; or something like that; also, I'm not sure I follow your example, if you want the property of MyModel, just use it
```def func(value: int): . . .```
```func(MyModel.myProperty)```; and while it may not be easy or possible to redesign, typically if you find yourself doing typechecks in python, it's possible and recommended to design them out; none of this is hard and fast, just kind of a best practice when you aren't constrained by other factors"
1160,1508434856.000412,Kellye,"that's was just an example, basically you end up having 5-10+ props and nested objects. As I referred before, TypeScript makes it possible - you can define an 'interface' that will just specify data layout, but will be cut out after static type checks.; I'm just trying to figure out whether it's possible in python, there's not much information on pyi files; basically resources recommends you to have .pyi files in same structure as your source code"

1161,1508444510.000579,Beula,"Yeah, Mark, it is likely that `crunchy_json` does absolute imports; You may have to do the `pip install -e path/to/my/version` route; That installs it in ""editable"" mode (kind of like a symlink) and as you make changes in the lib it will reflect in the other environment you import it into; (note you will need to re-import it)"

You don't specify `check=True`, so the except clause within `somefunc` doesn't catch anything"

1175,1508600681.000091,Collette,Okay?.. You want to generate a `sqlalchemy.orm` model based on some arbitrary class attributes?
1175,1508600704.000141,Winnie,those sound like the appropriate words
1175,1508600877.000016,Vita,"<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/automap.html> You could use something like this to just take it from the db, otherwise it might be simpler to just create the class"

1175,1508601511.000112,Winnie,"<@Vita> the db doesn't exist yet
<@Collette> my use case is that my project consists of a scraper that stores its data as objects, but I want to persist those using a db

1175,1508601599.000009,Collette,"Well, no. DB models can, but really shouldn't map directly to objects. How would you declare relationships without writing them manually, for instance?; When you write DB models, you model your database. That's something orthogonal to how you store data in memory."
1175,1508601742.000034,Winnie,well It could be smart and see that classes as fields are just links to another table; but I see what you mean; how are mbid's generated?

Process would be something like:
Script prompts user for site number
Site number is defined as a variable
Script connects to M$SQL and uses the site number variable within the query
Script can then either create new python variables directly from SQL query results *or* return SQL query results to a list or tuple for reading/manipulation. 

I have looked into pymssql and pypyodbc and either I am too noob to catch onto something that's already in my face, or I don't see variables as a possible value to include in a SQL query. 

Any pointer or help are greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
1183,1508761043.000347,Cynthia,Looks like pymssql exposes the commonly-used Python DB-API: <http://pymssql.org/en/stable/pymssql_examples.html#basic-features-strict-db-api-compliance>; It looks like pypyodbc is also DB-API compliant. I'd be surprised if there's any commonly-used Python database adapters that aren't.
1183,1508761496.000095,Ciera,sqlalchemy is often the go to; there is a full ORM but also the core that format your sql querries

1185,1508775973.000008,Meg,:facepalm:
1185,1508775976.000349,Rikki,"Well, they attempted this weeks ago... and only 30% of everything copied.; so I had to compare what was in Azure against what was on disk and make a new manifest to copy; you can see how much fun this is :slightly_smiling_face:"
1185,1508776034.000307,Meg,"yeah, I can; well, you probably could do something with shutils and multi-processing; but in all in all, using something like deltacopy or something similar would be better for you; no development time required for you; and a production-ready application with years worth of work and bugfixes"
1185,1508776128.000491,Rikki,"Yeah, but it doesn't address the cherry picking of files though which stinks otherwise, this would be a great solution"
1185,1508776138.000204,Meg,why do you need to cherry pick?; why not restart from zero
1185,1508776150.000377,Rikki,because those files are already in azure; everything is going to azure from an on-prem solution
1185,1508776201.000404,Meg,"I’m still not sure; you want to copy everything from azure to local; last time this was tried, about 30% of the transfer succeeded"
1185,1508776231.000378,Rikki,"out of 100 files in nested folders, i may only need 20 as the other 80 already exist in azure."
1185,1508776245.000584,Sirena,"unless I'm misunderstanding your meaning gisdev, deltacopy will do cherry picking"
1185,1508776258.000123,Rikki,we have to ship these hard drives to microsoft to load; the drives were wiped when they were returned
1185,1508777567.000253,Meg,sorry if I wasn’t able to help much; hope you can figure something out with your internal company policies
1185,1508777953.000698,Rikki,Let's simplify it... How would you assign a drive letter to a worker pool of 2 :slightly_smiling_face:; so that process 1 gets drive X and process 2 gets drive Y

1186,1508782492.000161,Seema,<@Marquita> I'm under the impression that sorted is stable and that you could first sort reversed on value then on key achieving both desired outcomes
1186,1508782546.000375,Antionette,<@Seema> You are correct about sorted being stable - <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts>; That documentation also goes on to use that fact to give an example of sorting based on multiple attributes
1186,1508782732.000138,Seema,"I was there recently and I ended up trying all four variations and still was barely confident I understood how it was doing it.  I was doing list of tuples just like the example.  Eventually, though, success. :slightly_smiling_face:"

1186,1508782920.000553,Seema,"Arsenii, do you have a thing you would like to try or some sort of project or program you want to make?"
1186,1508783044.000297,Lory,"<@Jamaal>, as <@Seema> is suggesting, project based learning is one of the better known approaches to learning a language. While working on a project, it is then useful to see how others approached similar problems and understand the differences in design"
1186,1508783214.000019,Jamaal,I took some time off between jobs to learn the language from scratch. I am currently using Python the Hard Way tutorials and wanted to supplement with some coding exercises. Here is what I found to start: <https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/>

1186,1508783312.000197,Jamaal,I know; but with open source and a great community I think it is possible

1186,1508783630.00058,Johana,so are we touting coding challenges as a way to learn programming faster or something?; i don’t think challenges have helped me learn a language as much as getting practice using concepts I already know and learning to use them in new ways.

1189,1508786735.000062,Vita,How do people feel about functional testing in addition to unit testing? Think it is overkill or not needed until certain points in a project?
1189,1508787929.000379,Ronni,It's not overkill

1190,1508788347.000603,Seema,"it was more about linting and humans than about functional testing though, very nuanced"
1190,1508789652.000103,Kellye,can anyone suggest popular IoC (inversion of control) package to use? PyPI provides too much to choose from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=dependency+injection&amp;submit=search>
1190,1508790228.000378,Lory,"Is there any real reason to using an ORM (like sqlalchamy) besides not having to write queries yourself? I personally have my own module for storing/executing/returning queries and at times it runs faster than the ORM, obviously because a human is better at constructing complex queries than a computer is (for now). So besides the obvious, are there other reasons you guys find yourselves using one?"
1190,1508790263.000459,Meg,"how maintainable is your own module :slightly_smiling_face:; scalable? works with schema changes without tinkering?; I mean, sure there are reasons to use raw sql over an ORM; but those should be limited to areas where the optimization is needed; not as a first reaction"
1190,1508790342.000244,Issac,"<@Lory> I generally try to avoid ORMs since I think they are often the wrong approach to the general problem of database abstraction, so you're not alone, but I'm sure you'll get _plenty_ of arguments for why you should use one"
1190,1508790371.000386,Meg,"<@Issac> how maintainable is that, though?"
1190,1508790411.000429,Lory,"for just myself and a few friends that use it, it's fairly easy. Just deifne your boiler plate queries and then call them through a few defined methods that give me all results or one result or whatever and have them preformatted to how I like my data structured; schema changes require manual intervention lol"
1190,1508790483.000236,Issac,"<@Meg> you mean not using an ORM?  I would tend to argue that the types of abstractions that ORMs introduce is increasing the complexity of the code and introduces more maintenance overhead than not using one, although like anything else in development you can do it badly and incur a lot of pain"
1190,1508790505.000251,Lory,"sorry no, my small module"
1190,1508790525.000342,Antionette,"<@Meg> There's a middle ground between ORM and raw SQL (like <http://knexjs.org/> for node, not sure of a good example in python) that helps with maintainability while being a more simple abstraction"
1190,1508790538.000422,Meg,"django ORM works similar, I think; as well as sqlalchemy, in which you can write raw sql and it’ll handle it for you"
1190,1508790559.000113,Lory,"My biggest gripe is that it feels awkward to use one in the code, and that's just because of a lack of familiarity with using ORM's, So I figured what does it _really_ matter if I just use my own"
1190,1508790571.000221,Meg,"and for your own projects, thats fine; if you’re working on non-super critical performance in a team, then I would definitely make you justify the case of not using an ORM if I were interviewing you"
1190,1508790672.000284,Lory,"and it just that, I'm trying to get into free lance web application design so I'm slowly building my own modules for things I feel are bloated like ORM's, Login modules, etc..."
1190,1508790702.000545,Meg,sqlalchemy was started because the author was tired of hibernate’s bloatedness :slightly_smiling_face:
1190,1508790727.000122,Mallie,"Like most things you just need to be aware of the trade-offs, the once that have been mentioned incl. Imagine working on a large team or needing lots of people to be able to access and modify things in the database (like will happen many many times with a fairly complex dynamic website) and trusting all developers to get the SQL correct. That's a maintainability nightmare."
1190,1508790738.000382,Meg,bingo; that there is my primary argument against; especially if the actual performance difference is a few percents overall in load and query time
1190,1508790771.000232,Mallie,"And you may find that you only need to do one or two db calls, which is great, and you may find that as you maintain more and more projects all that ""custom"" SQL boilerplate wastes time."
1190,1508790839.000224,Meg,"furthermore, as a freelance web dev, <@Lory>, you have to consider the ‘when’ case, when another developer takes over your project; how easy is it for the other person/team to get up and running with your setup?"
1190,1508790876.000361,Johana,i think you should decide what is most important to you when working with the ORM or the core.; ORM is business objects and Core is more schema-centric.; if you want to be down in the weeds and know your db schema you should use core. if you want to deal with things like business objects use the ORM.
1190,1508790922.000377,Issac,"I would agree with <@Meg> there, freelancing does come with the burden of not just doing the most technically right thing, but the most expected thing since a lot of what your client is paying for is something that can serve as a baseline for future devs to continue to modify and support the application"
1190,1508790927.000138,Johana,it depends on the level of abstraction you want. I’ve used both quite extensively.; i try to avoid raw sql as much as possible.
1190,1508791023.000063,Meg,"speaking for myself, at my current place, I had to figure out what the hell the previous dev was thinking when he put together the query structure for a very important part of the API.  He just had python joining strings to construct the query, and execute with raw sql, using cursors, etc.

When I moved it over to using django ORM, the actual query time went down about 50 milliseconds per query… without indexes"
1190,1508791035.000033,Johana,much better to use a DSL like sqalchemy core.
1190,1508791057.000374,Issac,"I think ORMs are problematic because they unnecessarily couple several parts of the system that should be decoupled (datatype definitions, constraint solving, persistence, and transport of network attached data).  My personal experience is that in projects of any size they often end up causing more harm than good, and architecturally I dislike the types of applications that tend to have them central to the application"
1190,1508791088.000674,Johana,not all ORMs are created equal tho.; sqlalchemy’s orm is significantly better than others i’ve used.; for one it uses the unit of work pattern so you aren’t going to commit anything until it all works.
1190,1508791158.000597,Meg,"<@Issac> no argument there with your points about complexity and coupling.  But is that really significant, though?; and personally, in my projects, I’ve had to drop to raw sql a handful of times when performance was required"

1191,1508794392.000331,Micaela,"Hey all, in Python 2.7, using `unittest.assertRaisesRegexp`, how come it’s giving me false regex matching failures for my own exception classes, but working fine with something like `ValueError`?; in the fail message it says:
&gt; AssertionError: “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx” does not match “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx”; When… those… are… identical… ?; It’s not some weird text encoding comparison that’s failing, is it?; Actually nevermind, it’s something else going wrong somewhere, if I change the code to raise a ValueError instead I still get the same matching fail"
1191,1508794917.00017,Antionette,"Can you post the code that is failing?; If you have that exact string as the regex to match, you might need to escape the parens"
1192,1508818780.000003,Hermina,"Hi guys, i’m writing a module to read/write/edit files on target fpt server, I know python has supported ftp lib. But i just curious if I look for the folder files (in the server) and try doing nasty stuff with the file like normal file, and the ftp server can detect change, update it back to the ftp user? I dont mind write the module in the same server with fpt, but are there any drawback if I go down this path?"
1192,1508819130.000102,Bruno,What book do you guys recommend for a new python programmer that doesn't have programming experience. 
1192,1508819414.000057,Rosa,Think Python 2e.; A friend of mine was also new to programming and he found it really helpful.
1192,1508819912.000092,Seema,"I'd have to go with <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/> , partly because the book is free to read (the physical book still costs), partly because it's accessible and partly because it doesn't presume.  It lacks real apps and takes awhile to get going but it's free and if they put down the book for something better, no harm done."
1192,1508820374.000136,Bruno,The automate book still assumes you know basic programming concepts
1192,1508820660.000098,Seema,"the book does?  I thought it was based off the site which has things like
```You run the interactive shell by launching IDLE, which you installed with Python in the introduction. On Windows, open the Start menu, select All Programs ▸ Python 3.3, and then select IDLE (Python GUI). On OS X, select Applications ▸ MacPython 3.3 ▸ IDLE. On Ubuntu, open a new Terminal window and enter idle3.

A window with the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt should appear; that’s the interactive shell. Enter 2 + 2 at the prompt to have Python do some simple math.


&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2

The IDLE window should now show some text like this:

1193,1508827472.000192,Ciera,<@Bruno> it doesn't the first part is all about basic concept :slightly_smiling_face:
1194,1508832720.00042,Louis,"`file(s)` is a regex that matches the string `files`, but not the string `file(s)`.; `assertRaisesRegexp` kinda sucks if you just want to match literal strings, sadly. To do that reliably, you need something like:
```
assertRaisesRegexp(exc, r'^{}$'.format(re.escape(expected_message)), …)
```; Sometimes, it's easier to use the context manager instead:
```
with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
    do_something()
e = cm.exception
&lt;do assertions on e&gt;
```"
1194,1508834276.000261,Kayce,"<@Ines> I don't think that regex will help you since the structure of languages is more based off of context sensitive grammars. Regular expressions (finite automata) aren't powerful enough to represent the evaluate same set of strings as CSG's. (I could be wrong though, it's been years since I've done anything with computer science theory).; Hey all, Is there a way for me to be able to run a cleanup script when I use `deactivate` on my python envs? I set some environment variables in my `.env` that I would like to clear away when I'm done working on something."
1195,1508833925.000337,Ines,"I’m trying to write an application that will search for indentation made with 4 spaces or with tabs, and replace them with 2 spaces. In have found 2 options for doing this:  
1. with fileinput, but this seems to have some limitations and I don’t know if it can do what I want it to do
2. with re regular expressions
which one would you recommend?"
1195,1508834689.000333,Kayce,"<@Ines> Oh wait, what am I talking about. I totally missed your question (It's well past my bedtime). 

- get lines from your input file
- count how many spaces there are before the first character in the line"
1195,1508834753.000231,Ines,"would you please re-read my question :slightly_smiling_face: I know what I have to do, I just don’t know the easiest(/best) way to do it in python :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,1508834771.00029,Kayce,"- divide that count by four, then multiply that by two.
- take the substring that's all text, prepend ((space_count / 4) * 2)"
1195,1508834856.000159,Junita,"I’d probably recommend simply using a regex, then you don’t have to count; replacing four spaces or a tab with two spaces will work, regardless of how many multiples of four or tabs (or even a mix) there is"
1195,1508835120.000194,Ines,"<@Junita> thank you! I was thinking about fileinput as that will save me the trouble of opening the file, reading its content, fix the indentation, write back the content, close the file"
1195,1508835168.000087,Junita,"also note it might just be easier to do this with a tool like sed, unless you want to do use this as a learning exercise"
1195,1508835198.000154,Kayce,"I think it will confuse the regex. Assume the dashes are spaces, and the underscores are the replacement. Such that `----` gets evaluated to `_`.

What happens with `--------` (eight spaces)? Does it get evaluated like `_----` then `__`? Or does something weird happen like `-_---` where the regex wont capture the other 4 spaces."
1195,1508835234.000251,Ines,"but to be honest, I haven’t found how to search for patterns using line.replace… this is why I switched to re"
1195,1508835247.00033,Kayce,I say screw it and divide space count by two and the append the text.
1195,1508835270.000172,Ines,learning exercise and also I want a script that can be used independently
1195,1508835288.000068,Kayce,"Forsure!; One sec, I'm whipping something up"
1195,1508835334.000325,Suellen,&gt; I think it will confuse the regex.; I think regexes are not easily confused %); They are a powerful tool with maths 'n stuff backing them up
1195,1508835379.000214,Junita,"<@Kayce> it’s pretty easy, you make a match (such as `^(\s{4}|\t)`) and then feed it into `re.sub`, which can handle multiple replaces: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>"
1195,1508835513.00048,Suellen,exactly this; I even started to test it out :slightly_smiling_face:
1195,1508835551.000432,Junita,"there might need to be a tweak around the anchor to the beginning of the line, but yeah, that’s the general approach; Especially if this is meant to be a learning exercise, might as well learn.  :slightly_smiling_face:; If it’s not meant to be a learning exercise, I’d say using an external tool will be faster, more accurate"
1195,1508835677.000457,Kayce,Regex evaluated an input of 8 spaces to 6; =/ I'm no bueno with regex
1195,1508835739.000329,Junita,probably worth practicing with them to get better than instead of avoiding them.  :stuck_out_tongue:
1195,1508835809.000516,Kayce,True! I don't come across them terribly often though! Any sharp regex knowledge quickly fades after a week.
1195,1508835968.000026,Junita,"<@Ines> also, it goes without saying, backup these files first.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
1195,1508836634.000195,Ines,"<@Junita> :)))))))) of course it goes without saying. although, replace would have made the backup automatically. also, I don’t necessary agree that an external tool would be faster, unless your talking faster from a processing point of view. this “app” I’m writing has the ability to search the project structure recursively and finds all files I want to modify by looking at their extensions (which are parametrised so I can specify whatever extension I want), and reformats all files according to my needs, which are also parametrised. you will have the chance to take a look at the end result on github after I finish it. and if you’re asking yourself where did the need came from, all our JavaScript files have been indented with 4 spaces, but we want to switch to the recommended standard of 2 spaces :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,1508836726.000203,Junita,most editors/ides have something to do that project wide; how would replace have done that automatically though?  Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you said you had done already?
1195,1508837020.000362,Ines,"to be honest, I didn’t find how to do it in my IDE of choice, and neither using external plugins or other apps, either for my IDE or for a different editor. I’m pretty sure that there might be tools and probably even an implicit way of doing it in my IDE, it just wasn’t easy to find so I took this as a good opportunity to write a small python app :slightly_smiling_face: I think you understood what I’m trying to do, taking into consideration your commentaries. I can switch to a different standard in my IDE, it just won’t replace the existing format :slightly_smiling_face:; <@Junita> thanks again"
1195,1508837079.000133,Junita,"np, and yeah doesn’t hurt to do it as a learning exercise!"
1196,1508842281.000128,Omar,"Can someone explain to me what virtual envs are?
How/why are they used? And maybe how I can/should start using them?"
1196,1508842398.00027,Vada,"<@Omar> virtualenvs are segregated python installations you use for each individual project you run.; This way each project gets it's own python installation (whichever version you want), it's own environmental variables and, most importantly, it's own third part packages.; It avoids mixing dependencies between projects so you don't have any clashes; also means that you have a defined set of dependencies for each project which can be easily translated into a requirements.txt file; the easiest way to use it (in my opinion) is by installing this libary: <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation>; (for mac and linux)"

1200,1508854515.000448,Lory,Does anyone know of some good reading material on python's setup tools? I feel like most of the articles I've come across are just a waste of time
1200,1508854843.000114,Meg,how so?  what’s lacking?
1200,1508855283.00007,Lory,"I feel like all the tutorials/articles/etc have read as if the person they're trying to teach already knows the stuff and I haven't been able to fully pull out all the pieces that make it work. Like specifically how to structure your package with an __init__.py and why you can leave it empty and why you may or may not want to. How to do simple local pip installs of your project if you're not interested in publishing on pypi, like in the case of a webapp; I feel like they are all hyper focused on going from project to pypi and these are the steps to get there without ever really explaining anything. By ""they"" I just mean various articles I've found by googling from trusted sources to random people writing blog posts"
1200,1508856748.000563,Vita,"Just now seeing these responses (sorry). 
<@Seema> Ok, was the panel from this year? I would love to check it out
<@Ronni> I agree unit tests are easier to write, and I actually want functional tests more for a documentation for the devs to know the workflow more than anything. I was really shocked when I left a project for a year to come back to it and instantly understand where I left off and what needs to be done because of functional tests with user story comments"
1200,1508857077.000121,Johana,What pieces are you looking for <@Lory>?; It kinda sounds like structuring python projects.; I know this is a little bit of a lengthy video but it is by :dabeaz: and it enlightened me to python packages and imports (not pypi). <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTh1CXRaQ0>; I’m a bit partial to using sqlalchemy. it isn’t touted as the best library for beginners but learning it will definitely pay dividends.; it’s the defacto library for working with relational databases in python; I like django. i believe you can use the orm if you like separately from the web application.
1200,1508857778.000641,Burma,the function is to make queries to a monitoring DB
1200,1508857885.000117,Johana,How familiar are you with SQL?
1200,1508857922.000731,Burma,from 1 to 10 I would say 3; maybe 4
1200,1508857981.000356,Johana,ok so if you were to write raw sql queries you would have to learn SQL.; so that would probably take the most time/effort.; if you were to try and use the sqlalchemy orm you could work with the database in a more object oriented manner.; which is a bit easier for beginners.; :point_up: this snippet will show you how you can reflect the database and start querying it.
1200,1508858073.000018,Burma,ok sounds good not that I don't mind putting the time in and learning to write sql queries
1200,1508858093.000401,Johana,"yea, i’m not saying you do. i’m thinking in perspective of time usage.; you would need to alter the connection string and it will work for mysql.; that’s the beauty of using something like sqlalchemy. it has abstracted the nuances of the different databases.; if you want to switch to postgres you can pretty much just change the connection string."
1200,1508858211.000527,Burma,yea I know exactly what you mean by the time efficiency
1200,1508858215.000344,Johana,"and all your queries will work. you can’t say that with raw sql.; that’s the power of sqlalchemy. you never have to worry about if you can talk to a database. it pretty much covers all the major relational databases out there.; I can add some explanation to the snippet.; essentially what is happening is in sqlalchemy you need an `engine`.; this engine is the connection to the DBAPI.; it generates sql queries for you.; The ORM is built on top of that.; You need the `session` which is bound to the `engine` in order to use the ORM.; you could use the engine alone. or you can use the session. if you decide to use the session you have to use SQLAlchemy’s Expression language which looks like SQL, `select([Users.c.name]).where(Users.c.name == 'mike')`; that’s the equivalent of
```
SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = 'mike'
```; The ORM provides a more declarative way to talk to the database.; You essentially create a class that represents the table in your database."
1200,1508858457.000102,Burma,and just to get this right the session interacts with the ORM ?
1200,1508858458.000749,Johana,"I’m doing that above by reflecting the db.; yes!; the session is like a recorder. You can add things to it (insert) you can take things away(delete) etc.; If you want to add a user you can do something like this:
```
user = User(name='mike)
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```"
1200,1508858531.000018,Burma,So i guess session maybe the way to go then again I wouldnt mind learning the engine as well but it might be more of a learning curve
1200,1508858541.000219,Johana,"so now you can work with the database as you would any other python object.; i would learn the core after the ORM.; SQLAlchemy is stand-alone so you can integrate it into anything.; a CLI app you got it, a web app you goit.; here is a flask app that uses sqlalchemy. <https://gist.github.com/m1yag1/d354ab69398ab84f72f9e0b8c712ffb6>"
1200,1508858621.000011,Burma,nice thats pretty damn cool !
1200,1508858637.000469,Johana,check out lines 171-87; that’s a class model of the table in the database.; it’s faster if you model your database this way. you may have to do that. or you can reflect the db like in my first example.; sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database.; i’ve successfully ported applications using this very feature from microsoft sql server to postgresql.
1200,1508858934.000413,Burma,if you don't mind me asking ```sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database ?```
1200,1508858975.000317,Johana,typically an ORM or database library needs to “know” how the database schema looks like.
1200,1508858975.000595,Burma,why would I have to reflect my database ? in this this instance
1200,1508858979.000267,Johana,it does this via reflection.; it’s just an easy way to start working with the database.
1200,1508858993.00035,Burma,:+1:
1200,1508858998.000685,Johana,i use it a lot to do adhoc queries.; i do not recommend it for applications with a lot of db tables.; it can slow things down trying to “reverse engineer” the database schema if the database has tons of tables.
1200,1508859052.000496,Burma,hmm makes sense
1200,1508859069.000416,Johana,i wrote an app a couple years back that would reflect a database and provide a web api for CRUD on all the tables. it took like 10minutes to reflect the db.; lol; CRUD = create update and delete
1200,1508859150.000915,Burma,lol must of been extremely heavy yea basically I'll be making direct queries with an nagios like monitoring tool; but I''l be pulling values directly from the DB; but this should help me more than enough to get started
1200,1508859198.0003,Johana,that’s fine.; you can even create another engine for another db and and save to a different database lol.; if you needed to save locally for example.
1200,1508859316.000495,Burma,Interesting Yea I'll certainly take that idea Thanks again man <@Johana> :+1:
1200,1508859332.00023,Johana,"np, i came into python via sqlalchemy i was a DBA in a past life :wink:.; i got into web dev b/c i wanted to show data quickly to business users so then flask was a nice fit.; as a past database administrator i can tell you for a fact sqlalchemy is bad ass.; it is 10years old after all.; let me know how it goes <@Burma>"
1200,1508859565.000677,Lory,"<@Johana> I am trying to create a workflow for my buddy and I to work on a couple different webapps. Basically it consists of our local computers, the server where svn is hosting all my projects and then the production server to host the live webserver. I was talking with a coworker about it and he had mentioned setuptools might be useful for installing the projects out on the live server rather than having a make file just call *svn up* out on the production server. Setuptools is something I've avoided for a long while so I may not be explaining myself very well"
1200,1508859633.000383,Johana,"setuptools isn’t going to go put it on your server. you can use distutils to create a source distribution which is fine.; it will essentially create a tarball of your app you can copy to the server and extract.; you’ll use distutils for that.; Personally, i would use something like ansible or docker to deploy your app.; two things for that you will need a `<http://Manifest.in|Manifest.in>` file and `setup.py`; the idea is to create what is known as a “build artifact”."
1200,1508859869.000007,Burma,Will do <@Johana>
1200,1508859936.000566,Johana,"a build artifact is like a windows .exe or a .deb file or a python wheel.; if you go the ansible route you can create a playbook with your buddy and only have your keys on the server so that only you two can deploy.; you can checkout pyslackers github for examples: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/blob/master/ansible/playbook.yml>; i’m a bit busy but i’ll be back with an example :wink:; this is the ansible task that I have that creates a source distro before it copies it to my server:
```
- name: Create source distribution
  sudo: false
  local_action: shell source {{ pylocal_venv }}/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=""{{ pylocal_source_dir }}"" executable=""/bin/bash""
  run_once: true
```; replace the jinja tags with the proper values; `source virtualenv_path/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=/application/dir`; you can then scp or sftp the source distro to the server.; if you want to do it manually.; in ansible extracting an archive is pretty easy:

```
- name: Copy and extract source onto server
  unarchive:
    src:  /local/dir/
    dest: /remote/dir
```"

1211,1508955043.000306,Margrett,"So, I find myself recreating an existing Java application in Python.  One aspect is to generate an output XML file that must conform to a DTD file.  I've been using lxml.etree for generating the xml file.  

I have one problem.  The DTD requires certain types of nodes to occur before other types.    Before I start write sorting logic, is there anything that would consult a specified DTD and sort accordingly?; Assuming no, any best practice on sorting peer nodes by node-type?"
1211,1508956578.000028,Meg,"<@Margrett>, I’m drawing a blank, sorry"
1211,1508956874.000003,Mallie,"<@Margrett> Sorting? I'm confused, why don't you just define your schema or add the nodes in the correct order?"
1212,1508956599.00067,Meg,are you looking for something like with spring beans xml configuration?; something along the lines of importing <http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd> and going from there?
1212,1508956876.000512,Johana,i don’t think so. you’ll have to generate the file and then validate it.; unless there is something new. I used to do HL7 messaging which had a similar workflow.
1212,1508956902.00032,Mallie,"Oh I re-read - to move from invalid to a valid schema, :disappointed:; Anything trying to be more clever than <@Johana> suggestion is probably just going to make things worse"
1212,1508957015.000195,Johana,"it would be hard to catch all the edge cases.; you might be able to do something creative with a jinja2 template.; i did that once with some HL7 messages.; ```
{% for person in persons %}

    &lt;name&gt;{{ person.name }}&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;
{% endif %}
```; <@Margrett> :point_up: I don’t know how much your data is changing but your schema definition should help you build the template. Then all you need to do is pass in all the data and it automagically shows up in the right order…; then you don’t even have to fiddle with any xml at all just data. :wink:"
1212,1508958672.000049,Margrett,"Thanks for the responses.  Part of the tools purpose is to transform unstructured data from old systems into a nice tidy XML that our product understands.; I'm converting it form a pure GUI to a backend python module + GUI; So, I don't know what wacky things my end-users are going to do."
1212,1508958783.000151,Johana,you might also look into what capabilities pycharm has with xml. it is quite powerful when it comes to xml.
1212,1508958787.000157,Margrett,"I think I've settled on adding a hidden `_sort_rank = integer` to each of my ~40 object types; Then, using bisect to do sorted inserts as objects are child objects are added; I wasn't planning on sorting that early, but I'm now realizing it could have a hidden payoff in the GUI phase"
1212,1508958843.000452,Johana,looks like a fun challenge.; except for the xml part.; xml bleh.
1212,1508958876.000175,Margrett,"Lol, XML has been my constant love/hate relationship for ~10 years."
1212,1508958887.000509,Johana,but i know how it is. HL7 was for health system integration and it was the most complex xml crap i have ever dealt with.
1212,1508958970.000104,Margrett,"My favorite part was the early days of 32 bit applications.  $1,000+ ""enterprise"" XML editors that were unable to open a 10 MB xml file.; Watched them start opening the file, then shoot to using 2GB of memory, then either freeze or crash.; No idea what they heck they were doing; More silly XML stuff.  A past employer purchased an XML based workflow processing engine / app server that we apparently spent so much on, we had to delay reporting earnings.; My team was told to use it, but I never had training on it, on a big project.  I continued to write my logic in XLST, because it was what I used for everything else."
1212,1508959217.000382,Johana,is it an EDI app?; something like Rhapsody?
1212,1508959258.000038,Margrett,What I'm writing now?
1212,1508959268.000127,Johana,the XML based workflow processing engine; those are typically called EDI apps; Electronic Data Interchange; i’ve worked with a few. just curious.
1212,1508959353.000579,Margrett,"Kind of.  We were using it to enhance our identity management solution.  So grab events from PeopleSoft, then propagate changes in a bunch of login systems and purchasing apps.; Then reverse that process when someone gets terminated"
1212,1508959382.000444,Johana,yea and you have to move little widgets around.
1212,1508959415.000138,Margrett,"So, the XLST stuff was processing this giant XML doc in ~2 seconds; We ported everything into this big expensive engine, and it was &gt;1 hour"
1212,1508959542.000103,Johana,i mainly used it to report results of infections diseases to the USDA.
1212,1508959549.000214,Margrett,"That looks way more sophisticated than we had.; I'm struggling to remember the name.   The whole thing was web based.; I did write code in Symantec Workflow, looks a little more similar.; SilverStream"
1212,1508960121.000556,Johana,"gotta love windows nt.; ah i see you build web apps in it and it will deploy them at a very expensive cost.; the big benefit i see a system that is geared for sending XML messages is that they typically have logging, retrying, etc. built in. It makes it really nice to just set it up and forget about it. I remember sometimes my workflow might hang up but the help desk guy had a login where he could restart the process.; mirth may be able to do what you want as well. it’s opensource and geared to HL7 but HL7 is XML like anything else so i’m sure it can do a lot."

Thank you for submitting your application to join Upwork.
As we do with everyone who wishes to join Upwork, we carefully reviewed your profile to determine whether there is sufficient need for your skills and experience in the marketplace. Unfortunately, at this time there are already many freelancers with a similar skillset to yours and we cannot accept your application.
I know this news is likely disappointing to you. However, we want to make sure the freelancers we accept have the best chance at success on our platform. This requires us to not only closely review a freelancer’s talents and experience, but also balance those with the availability of projects. For example, at times our marketplace may have too many freelancers with similar skills competing for the number of projects that are available. To avoid the frustration that goes along with that, we must limit the number of new freelancers that can join our website. While you cannot submit proposals for jobs right now, the number of available jobs and freelancers vary throughout the year. We can offer a few suggestions for going forward:
If you have more relevant skills or experience to add now or in the future as you develop them, you can update and re-submit your application and we’ll take another look to see if there is a demand for your new skills.

3 python programs: Netcat replica, Spirograph animator, snake game replica.

I get what you mean about me not being an ideal freelancer yet, and your absolutely right, my plan was to take small jobs and slowly build up a portfolio, and then when confident enough try bidding on making entire websites and such.

But in my profile i say i'm not an expert, i've my experince level to entry level, i can see they a lot of job where people ask for cheap rookie people who wants a challenge, so i don't understand why i can't get a shot :disappointed:

I need to change an ImmutableMultiDict to a simple dict.

Have this:
ImmutableMultiDict([('*conciliation_status*', 'NC'), ('*conciliation_status*', 'CA'), ('group_id', '1'), ('end_date', '2017-12-31'), ('start_date', '2017-01-01')])

and need this:
{'*conciliation_status*': ['NC', 'CA'], 'group_id': '1', 'end_date': '2017-12-31', 'start_date': '2017-01-01'}

I could resolve this case with something like this:
```
def normalize(data):
    normalized_data = {}

    for key, value in dict(data).items():
        if len(value) &gt; 1:
            normalized_data[key] = value
        else:
            normalized_data[key] = value[0]

    return normalized_data
```

But I wonder if there are others betters ways to do this.
Any idea?"

1227,1509108019.000285,Virgen,"Good morning everyone!!! (its morning here in EST); I am quite novice and need a little direction.
Just point me in the direction and I am happy to figure it out from there. I learn better that way. 
I am trying to write a program to ping all hosts in a subnet and then display the results in a table.
What I have already. (both found somewhere on the internet and modified for my needs...)
1. A ""ping sweep"" that will output the IP and DNS name of any host that respondes.
2. A simple Plotly program that will read a CSV and output it in an HTML table.; .; I am struggling to figure out how best to get my data into the plotly table. I am trying to avoid writing to a csv and then reading it back into the plotly table. Unless that is the best way to achieve my goal, then I will happily do that.
Ideas? 
I am currently reading up on dictionaries and seeing if that may serve my purpose...
Thank you for any help!!!"
1228,1509111146.000553,Lory,<@Virgen> you already have your data being parsed from the csv? You can use jinja templates to dynamically build the results into the table
1228,1509111293.000317,Virgen,"negative. the plotly bit is just pulling data from a random test csv.; the ping sweep bit runs an if/then loop which tests each IP and returns the IP and DNS name if anything responds.; <@Lory> I'll check into jinja as well, thx!"
1228,1509111540.000186,Lory,"can you pop that into a code block, can't tell where the indentation is supposed to be; little plus sign next to the text input"

1228,1509113211.000069,Virgen,"<@Lory> I cannot, I get an upload error. I blame the webfilter and its admin... (i'm the webfilter admin...); <@Lory> I got the webfilter admin to fix his gear...; that's the general loop that outputs the data. So, rather than just printing the output to console, I want to store it in a way that can be read into and displayed in a table."
1228,1509113843.000029,Lory,"well for starters, that initial for loop where you're running `ping` on the servers, you're only ever capturing the output of the last one that runs in `output`, unless `stdout=...` is supposed to be within the for loop which it looks like it should be but is just an indentation error; yea so I would build some kind of dictionary or nested list and then use a jinja template to iterate over that data structure and create a table entry for each. That would definitely be a fairly easy approach"

I've looked everywhere for any trace of the name with a hyphen or a space, I've deleted the caches, run `setup.py clean`, changed the name to something else entirely, removed the parameter, traced through the setuptools code to see how it's set, and I can't get it to stop naming it `my-package` in PKG-INFO.

But when I go to transcript this to my .py and execute it shows me ""TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable"" list[0] gives me the latitude info... but when I do the same in my .py it not works...; How can I iterate through these values?; rows[0][0] does not work it returns me the first letter of the fist value; Like 'P' in [""Pitimbu"",[-5.876271, -35.224500]]"
1240,1509291900.000053,Meg,yeah
1240,1509291900.000102,Carolin,and not -5.876271
1240,1509291914.000063,Meg,because `row[0]` is a string; `row[0]` value is `‘Pitimbu’]
1240,1509291959.000106,Carolin,how I got <@Meg>
1240,1509291961.000086,Meg,`row[1][0]` would return `-5.876...`
1240,1509291961.000121,Carolin,:slightly_smiling_face:
1240,1509291995.000027,Meg,what you have to remember is you can access a character in a string by its index position
1240,1509292025.000115,Carolin,thanks dude! It worked... I guess that I was at 4am in this part KKKKKKKK omg so ashamed; thanks <@Meg>!

1241,1509294930.000047,Meg,"took me a bit of getting used to, coming from java and JS"
1241,1509295001.000003,Carolin,haha same as me; or same as you; english is not my first language too KKK; ops... KKK = hahaha in Brazil; dont get me wrong
1241,1509295942.000056,Meg,"ah, ok.  Here in the US, it means Ku Klux Klan, which is definitely not a haha :smile:"
1241,1509296224.000005,Mallie,<@Carolin> Do you pronounce it like 'kay kay kay'?
1241,1509296846.000129,Carolin,<@Mallie> not like  that 'cause the k here is little bit different is more like ka in  kakaroto ( <https://youtu.be/w8GGm9ZzgvU?t=23s> ) but in a laugh way. If you put in youtube 'risada brasileiro kkk' you should find some results
1242,1509295950.000069,Meg,but good to know!
1242,1509296375.000013,Carolin,"yeah I know but only noticed after write it; <@Leif> is hahaha, a laugh or lol, not like in US that is Ku Klux Klan as <@Meg> talked earlier"
1242,1509308843.000035,Mallie,<@Meg> Japanese 'ka' in 'kakarot' is basically 'ca' in 'car'; Any C#/.NET users around?

1242,1509317054.000002,Mallie,"I may have found what I was looking for but basically I was just looking for any sort of standard opinion on how applications/projects should be laid out.; I think I was using the wrong terms and not finding much, but I know found some stuff that makes sense.; If you have a good resource to share that'd be cool, I was just lost for a few minutes of googling looking for something I thought would be pretty obvious."
1242,1509317298.000006,Johana,pluralsight has lots of .net junk. I learned visual basic in the aol 2.5 days.

1243,1509299927.00001,Leif,<@Carolin> That is an interesting fact. What does kkk stand for?
1244,1509303478.000135,Meg,"so in english, its more of a `caw` sound, than `kay`?"

I’ve got most of the way there ( I think ) but I’ve got a few issues and questions… (Disclaimer: I’m totally new to VIM) DM me; Nevermind, I’ve got there I think.  My only issue is that YCM doesn’t autocomplete here: `from typing import ...` I expect it to pop up and offer the import like `List, Callable etc...`. However if I do `import List \n List.[popup]` it autocompletes all of the classes inside the site package there.. So I’ve missed a configuration somewhere or it’s just not meant to work like that"

1247,1509334718.00001,Collette,"Click is much more explicit about what's going on... I don't like these examples. What I see from the guide, `fire` is full of implicit conversions to optional/required arguments, subcommands, etc."

1249,1509359085.000101,Meg,"<@Evelin> a couple things come to mind

1. Hack day in office - each person picks something a little out of their area of expertise and tries to do something that has potential to benefit the company/ongoing projects.  
2. Host or attend a local meetup in one of the languages you work in
3. Consider Pluralsight/Udemy/Safari Online,  and other education sites as an employee perk
4. One or two conferences per year.  A different dev can go to each, and give a presentation/report when he/she comes back.  Previous position sent people to JavaOne, and they gave illuminating presentations after
5. Start being active in the dev group of the language/framework you typically work with.  eg, django developers on IRC, flask, etc"
1250,1509358686.000188,Krysta,Conferences?
1251,1509359491.000377,Mirian,+1; also we're trying to implement a process where everyone can suggest a topic that he wants to give a presentation or wants to hear about it from someone else; and those presentations would be once a month or so
1251,1509359617.00011,Meg,"yes.  I suggested something similar a couple times at my office and it was done twice before the others developed a lack of interest; tough balance - does all the content come from a clique group, and the rest of the team kinda coasts along, or is it required that everyone do at least one a year?"
1251,1509359794.000179,Mirian,"we won't make it required to attend; but want to provide food, drinks etc. to encourage people to stay after working hours"
1251,1509359898.000408,Meg,"yeah, this was like a scheduled block during the day, once a month; usually 90 minutes at 3p, and everyone could leave after"
1251,1509360031.000098,Mirian,and do you have some more conclusions why it failed?
1251,1509360037.000297,Meg,"<@Evelin> too bad you’re out of the London area, or I could point you to some people at a company I know in Guildford; company culture, no driving force pushing standards and such."
1251,1509360087.000178,Mirian,"ok, and how big is the company?"
1251,1509360092.00012,Meg,"entire team is pretty lazy in a number of ways, and very comfortable; 5 devs total, 15 people in all; so a pretty small one"
1251,1509360149.000074,Toby,hello
1251,1509360152.000026,Meg,"its a type of environment that I think fosters stagnation, in a number of ways"
1251,1509360167.000355,Mirian,"oh, we're a small one too, but some kind of software agency, so about 15 developers, 2 QA and CEO"
1251,1509360173.00043,Meg,"fortunately, I’m isolated from about 95% of that"
1251,1509360227.000279,Mirian,but looking for ways to scale and stay competetive against bigger and more well-known companies
1251,1509360258.000222,Meg,"part of the problem is the entire company started as a print publishing company, and moved to tech.  the owner was a subject matter expert originally, but is certainly not now nor ever when it comes to tech.  but she insists on having the kind of control over decisions as if she were.  Combined with the fact there is _no_ leadership at all, and its not suprising; its pretty well known that we need some sort of project manager involved, but no way will a hire ever happen for that"
1251,1509360390.000014,Mirian,"that's not good I guess, maybe one of you can go into  management"
1251,1509360490.000066,Toby,is tkinter a good library to use when starting with gui's?
1251,1509360529.00006,Meg,"Maybe eventually, but certainly not at this place "
1251,1509360587.000239,Ciera,I played a bit with it and it was ok. Your gui's won't be beautiful but it should be a good start
1251,1509360607.00042,Meg,I'd say they've lost about 8M USD in about 9 years or so due lost sales and turnover as well as a huge mountain of technical debt that is making feature development move like molasses 
1251,1509360610.000307,Emily,yes its; true !!; you can try QT
1251,1509360644.000049,Meg,"Hell, git branching is black magic to some of them."
1251,1509360657.000178,Toby,"thanks, so if its a good base/starting point, what would be a ""beautiful gui""? id like it to remain free though"
1251,1509360757.000012,Emily,i guess PyQt
1251,1509360768.000135,Toby,i thought pyqt was paid?
1251,1509360778.000029,Emily,WxPython; open source

1251,1509361004.000134,Toby,in what way?
1251,1509361034.00007,Emily,tell me about you !
1251,1509361192.000386,Mirian,so maybe those presentations should bring topics like git workflow and its' benefits?
1251,1509361320.000232,Vada,This is a weird conversation with all the quoting; There is no need to share every message as you respond. you can just respond - it's actually easier to follow that way
1251,1509361392.000104,Collette,"Especially after Kevin Spacey's coming-out...; By the ways, there are <#C07EFN21K|random> and <#C07EHQYFN|introductions> which are more suitable for such personal discussions."

1253,1509378791.000038,Lory,a list comprehension sounds like the best way to do it based on my experiences; unless there's a way to just do the entire list in one go which I am not aware of personally
1253,1509378824.00062,Margrett,"Yah, I didn't see some hidden functionality in isinstance, at least from the official docs"
1253,1509378840.0008,Scot,But you won't be using the resulting list anyway... Why not just `for param in params: assert(....)`?
1253,1509378885.000556,Lory,you could have your class self validate before being appended to the list or something too. depends on your code structure but the various approaches all do the same thing at the end of the day
1253,1509378894.000209,Margrett,"I probably should just use a normal for loop, that way I can complain about the specific non-conforming item.; In my current code, I'm just talking to myself, but this is very similar to a another one of my projects where I expect random  non-python proficient people to be using my classes; Figured I should try to be consistent in my approach :slightly_smiling_face:"
1253,1509379122.000401,Scot,I personally wouldn't use a list comprehension if I didn't intend to use the resulting list for anything
1253,1509379123.000464,Junita,"could also do a test in the list comprehension, and use `any` and `all` type checks"
1253,1509379286.000348,Ciera,```Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class``` Should you really do that and not let it fails later on ?

In this tool, if a user provides me with wacky input data, it could be devastating to the downstream systems that I'm re-configuring.; I do like the potential idea of using any/all, need to play with that.

1253,1509379504.000755,Junita,yeah I use that sometimes and like it.  the inline assert seems nice too as well

<@Evelin> We did a rotating presentation at work on a dev focused topic, that helped a bit to open up discussion towards newer ways of doing things. We also had a couple hours a week dedicating to do ""learning"" but it worked better when there was a discussion about what that was and what the goals were, honestly most devs didn't even use it :disappointed:
Meetups is not something you can force but it's definitely helped me to upskill a lot.

Looking back, the times that our team/tech did move up was when one person was assigned the responsibility to implement a new process and spent the time actually implementing it, then doing a presentation on it so that the others know what's going on and how to work with it now that it's there."

1256,1509396183.000246,Meg,sounds like you need to make a priority queue
1256,1509396356.000015,Elanor,"actually all I have is dictionary with some json objects in it ,I want to know how can I check if one of those objects come before another one or not"

1256,1509396444.00042,Elanor,"yes you are right; that's why is not that easy to do that , my dictionary is specific dictionary which the order is important to me"
1256,1509396479.000138,Lory,Lists are ordered so that's reliable but only helps if you know what you're looking for. I've never used priority ques so I'm not sure how they work personally
1256,1509396493.000696,Antionette,You could try using an ordereddict; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict>

1256,1509396682.00033,Keesha,<@Elanor> are you looking to sort your dictionary by key or value?
1256,1509396686.00025,Meg,ordered dicts only work with insertion order; sounds like you need to write a list comp to output your dict to a list based on the key value

1256,1509398051.000545,Seema,"and when you say they are ordered, are they ordered by a key or a value or are you thinking that they're are indexed?"

1256,1509398188.000192,Seema,<@Elanor> what is it about OrderedDict that think won't work?; and is the creation of the dictionary a one-time thing?
1256,1509398390.000161,Elanor,"my dict's value is another dictionary; I think I solved this problem , because I have enabled the timpestamp; and then I dont need to have the dictionary ordered or not , since it will come with timestamp"

1258,1509402476.000147,Daysi,"Hi, I recently was asked to work on a django project and I’m having a little difficulty getting the app set up locally.  Python 3.6 and django 1.11.  I created the database and went to run the migration files, but I get an error saying “relation table_name does not exist”.  That table should be created by the first migration file based on what I can tell.  I’m not sure why it would be complaining about a table not existing when there are no tables at all (brand new db).  Should I be deleting the migration files and running makemigrations?  That doesn’t seem to make much sense, but not sure at this point. I’m a rails and phoenix developer, this is my first time with django.  Any help or suggestions would be awesome!"
1258,1509402637.000123,Rosetta,You should probably run your own. Who knows what state the DB was in when those first migrations were generated; It sounds like you're missing some or the tables/database were created outside of Django

1260,1509423088.000191,Bruno,just curious. i havent either.
1260,1509423257.000094,Ricki,Morning  everyone! :}
1260,1509423282.000044,Bruno,good evening
1260,1509423332.000112,Ricki,<@Bruno> i would love some help if you don't mind me asking
1260,1509423350.000123,Vena,@Furkanzmc thank you
1260,1509423399.000033,Ricki,i'm currently sudying on team treehouse right know and i'm stuck on a question
1260,1509423411.000048,Bruno,"<@Ricki> idk if i will be able to, but its an open forum. just ask and if someone knows and can help they probably will"
1260,1509423436.000003,Ricki,any advice anyone?
1260,1509423462.000079,Bruno,what is your problem
1260,1509423477.000011,Ricki,its saying i made a mistake
1260,1509423507.000158,Bruno,check where your quotes are; `.format()` is a function that operates on a string
1260,1509423617.000105,Ricki,"it says that i don't have to print() anything to pass the quiz, so how do i use the .format() in my variable?; i understand how to use it in print()"
1260,1509423680.000062,Bruno,"when in a terminal like that, you dont need to use print as whatever the result is, it will output to the console."
1260,1509423692.000029,Ricki,oh
1260,1509423713.000052,Bruno,"so, look at the format, on how you use string.format(), then compare to how you are using format. there is a syntax error in your code.; one of the last few lines; look at the last line and what is spit out. it means that the line before it is one whole string; did you find it <@Ricki>?"
1260,1509423972.000043,Ricki,checking it out now <@Bruno>; man.. i still don't get it <@Bruno> i sware i'm going to go bald :grimacing:
1260,1509424567.000015,Bruno,"lol its ok; so the syntax of format is `""some string {name}"".format(name)`; check your quoting"
1260,1509425052.000007,Ricki,"This is what i have 'code' subject=""Treehouse loves{}"".format(name)"
1260,1509425095.000159,Bruno,"thats the line with the error; in the image, its different"
1260,1509425109.000156,Ricki,yes
1260,1509425113.000168,Bruno,you moved the last double quote
1260,1509425124.000103,Ricki,i just updated it to what you typed
1260,1509425139.000104,Bruno,that should work. `subject` should now spit out the proper text; you had the last double quote at the end; do you see what the error was? is it working for you now?
1260,1509425368.000057,Ricki,"i see, my errors was, but this thing still won't let me pass.. :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1260,1509425446.000095,Bruno,might need a space between `loves` and `{}` ?
1260,1509425842.000104,Ricki,"nothing <@Bruno>  but i'm going to sleep on it, thanks anyways! I really do appreciate it, i  will dm you later :fist::skin-tone-4:"
1260,1509425913.000161,Bruno,np; good luck
1260,1509426125.000042,Winnifred,what is the latest stable version of 3.4?
1260,1509426169.000071,Bruno,locally pyenv tells me it is `3.4.6`; <@Winnifred>
1260,1509426194.000149,Winnifred,"Ah, thanks <@Bruno>!; I need to learn that command. I r `pyenv` n00b."
1260,1509426206.000134,Bruno,Si; just check out the pyenv library; i dont use it to manage my virtual envs. i just use it to install python versions.; i use pipenv
1260,1509426277.000029,Winnifred,"gotcha, what are your thoughts about installing virtualenv on each version and creating them that way?"
1260,1509426292.000157,Bruno,what do you mean?; create a venv for each version of python?
1260,1509426333.000058,Winnifred,"well, installing a venv manager on each version"
1260,1509426334.000163,Bruno,i just create them as I need them; nah.; if you install pyenv you can use that to manage installation of whole python versions. then i just use pipenv to manage my environemnts. which uses `pew` under the hood. so i use that to create the actual env.
1260,1509426428.000131,Winnifred,"ah, okay"
1260,1509426514.000143,Bruno,"so my workflow:
```
pipenv install 3.4.6
pew new --py ~/.pyenv/versions/3.4.6/bin/python my_env_name
# this will auto activate the environment
```
then if i want to activate that env later i just do ```pew workon my_env_name``` and `exit` to leave the environment; or, you can run a command from within that environment without activating it, just `cd` into the project with a `Pipfile` and you can run `pipenv run -- flask run` to run flask, for example; but i find it easier to just activate the env"
1260,1509426857.000081,Winnifred,"Nice, I'll have to check out `pipenv`."
1261,1509437481.000306,Gwenda,"Hey Everyone ! Quick (meta) questions for you guys. I wasn't sure what channel post them so here goes: I recently had my ""aha"" moment with regards to multithreading and I was wondering if it it's relevant to use such an approach in the context of web scraping (if you have a ton of sites to extract data from) or in the context of database interaction (say you have a csv and you want to insert each row as a row in a given DB) is there any benefit to that ? What's your experience ?; Also, if the main reason for multithreading is to speed things up then why do we use locks (don't they defeat the purpose if other threads have to wait for locks to be released before proceeding ?) Thanks in advance for your clarifications"
1261,1509437702.000073,Collette,"<@Gwenda> because threads can share the same memory. If two or more threads try to modify a list, for example, you can't predict the exact order of modifications. Thus you need a lock to make sure such mutable shared memory can be modified by a single thread at a time.; If you don't share any memory, then you don't need any locks. But in that case you actually don't need threads - you need multiple processes"
1261,1509437792.000163,Gwenda,ah very interesting point !; so if memory access is not an issue then multiprocessing is more suited ?
1261,1509437845.000301,Collette,"It really depends on your actual use-case, but in general - yes.; The whole point of having multiple threads is to avoid expensive communication between isolated memories, by having a shared memory."
1261,1509437942.000003,Gwenda,ah I see now ! Makes sense; thanks <@Collette>!
1262,1509439489.00006,Mafalda,I am looking to plot time series data for multiple data values together any leads to do so in python?
1263,1509444316.000196,Jamar,"Morning, Just wondered if any has any experience with a good method to cleanly terminate all threads with Ctrl C on a script using multiprocess pool map?"
1263,1509444405.000135,Vada,isn't ctrl c the same as the kkill signal?; If you have the thread ids you can just send a kill signal for each id; via bash
1263,1509444542.000164,Jamar,havent done a whole lot with Multiprocessing with python I have tried the normal try except with KeyboardInterrupt: but it just kills the current thread I assume; as it just continues
1263,1509444550.000242,Scot,"You have to find the root id, otherwise it will keep spawning more processes no?"

1265,1509459144.000197,Ciera,very much :point_up:
1265,1509459302.000534,Lory,I initially had taken that route but the data I am pulling dates out of comes form a few different sources as strings. I figured the date time approach would work in a more predictable environment rather than here where I am conditionally modifying specific pieces and at times reusing the same data for new results. It get's converted after this function returns when I am ready to do my db inserts; would you have a suggestion as to how to constructively build a date with arbitrary y/m/d information using the date time method? I am not too familiar with how to use it correctly so I may have had a bad implementation

1265,1509459914.000221,Lory,"I'll look deeper into that aspect. However, ignoring the dates and looking at the if/else structure I have set up, is there any other way to construct it such that I don't need 2 areas in which I check the status of `has_day` or is that inherently impossible because I need to first check the length of the date I have?; and all formats end up being `yymmdd` it's just a matter of what does it have currently, what is it expected to have and then any missing information is appended if needed, aka the day information which defaults to `01`"
1265,1509460027.000154,Ciera,on the top of my head I don't have any idea to check both condition
1265,1509460193.000362,Lory,Fair enough. I have a tendency to look too much into optimization lol. I'm going to dive into those date formats and see how that goes
1265,1509460233.000261,Ciera,well you could do a function but if the check is only a line or two long it's not necessary
1265,1509460266.000519,Lory,"Exactly what I was thinking, it would just take from the readability of the code"
1265,1509460281.000363,Ciera,depending on the conditions sometime having a 4 branch if/elif might be more readable but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1266,1509462802.000044,Virgen,"Quick question... What does the line ""Global E"" (Line 6) do in the following code snippet?"
1266,1509462866.000584,Lory,"as I recently found out, that allows you to create mutable global variables"
1266,1509462905.000384,Meghan,"It doesn't create them, it says the global is mutable from within this function."
1266,1509462909.000384,Vada,Well in that one it is in a comment; so it doesn't do anything
1266,1509462920.000882,Lory,Which is something you generally want to avoid doing in a production level piece of software. I personally cheat when writing test scripts to work out a specific function
1266,1509462935.000351,Virgen,correct. commented or not makes no difference when I run the snippet.
1266,1509462936.000357,Meghan,They are probably indicating they are using the global E.
1266,1509462947.000375,Vada,<@Meghan> E has not been created beforehand so does get created there.
1266,1509462954.000746,Meghan,"And yes, there is rarely a reason for it."
1266,1509462962.000353,Vada,actually you are right sorry; it gets declared later - this is just the person saying it is the global E
1266,1509462982.000599,Collette,"<@Virgen> without `global foo`, `foo = something` creates a local variable `foo` instead of modifying the global one"
1266,1509463004.000101,Meghan,"That isn't really later, since the stuff outside of the function are executed before the function."
1266,1509463166.000399,Vada,<@Meghan> corrected myself after :wink:
1266,1509463205.000618,Virgen,"I think I understand. So, if I were to expand on this initial snippet and wanted to use ""E"" later on, outside of the function, I would need to use the ""Global E"" to change the Global variable.; without the ""Global E"", the value of E would be unchanged outside of the function.; correct?"
1266,1509463287.000498,Lory,"If you wanted to modify it in some way yes, otherwise if it is simply a reference variable like a file path or something that you do not plan on modifying, then you do not need `global`; you only need `global VARIABLE` when you plan on modifying that data structure, which as everyone says, shouldn't really be done"
1266,1509463416.000674,Virgen,"In that snippet, in that function. Is ""E"" getting modified? Or is it being used to assign the users input to ""string""?"
1266,1509463427.000123,Vada,here is a good SO post on it.; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693385>

1272,1509535160.000105,Caitlyn,"hello community! :slightly_smiling_face: 
my ideas are currently blocked by the following problem:

*context:* i’m trying to build a simple (read-only) python api client for a storage product, but as I’m lazy I’m trying to do things dynamically… 
*problem*: the api server has endpoints like this:
```
GET: /monitor/host?nodeId=xxx[&amp;region=xxx]
GET: /monitor/nodelist?[region=xxx]
GET: /system/version
GET: /usage
```
my idea was to create classes for each endpoint (monitor, system, usage, etc), and get the “child-endpoint” (/monitor/*host* or /monitor/*nodelist*, etc) dynamically… but then, I would still need to get all URL the parameters (*nodeId*, *region*, etc)… the usage I have in mind is something like this:
```
client = WhateverStorageApi()
client.monitor.host(hostId='node01', region='eu-west-1') # this would generate: /monitor/host?nodeId=node01&amp;region=eu-west-1
```
my problem is: __getattr__ isn’t aware of any **kwargs, and __call__ only works for whenever I call a class.. is there any other well-known way of achieving this? so far I came up with:
```
class Monitor(object):

    base_url = 'monitor'
    
    def __getattr__(self, endpoint, **kwargs):
        
        base_call = '/{base_url}/{endpoint}'.format(
            base_url=Monitor.base_url,
            endpoint=endpoint
        )
    
        if 'nodeId' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?nodeId={node_id}'.format(
                node_id=kwargs['nodeId']
            )
    
        if 'region' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?region={region}'.format(
                region=kwargs['region']
            )
    
        # do something with base_call
``` 
(which I know… it simply doesn’t work)"

        endpoint += '?region={region}'.format(
            region=kwargs['region']
        )
    return endpoint

```; example usage ```In [9]: monitor = Monitor()

In [10]: monitor.host(nodeId='a')
Out[10]: '/monitor/host?nodeId=a'
```; did you have something similar in mind or did I completely misinterpret your question?"
1276,1509541861.000338,Caitlyn,"holy fuck! that is exactly what I needed!; :heart:; thank you; check this out:
```

    base_url = 'monitor'

1284,1509577775.000105,Kenny,"Hey folks. Take a look at this project: <https://github.com/datamade/census/blob/master/census/core.py>. I’m thinking about ways to make it more intuitive based on what it’s trying to model. For example, `acs5` and `acs5dp` are two different methods of `Census()`. But the class associated with `acs5` (`ACS5Client()`) is really where the meat of the method is, and the `ACS5DpClient()` class is just two variables that replace variables of `ACS5Client()`. Further, what I’m thinking would make more sense based on how the API is organized (see: <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html>) is if there were `acs5.detail`, `acs5.dataprofile`, `acs5.subject`, and `acs5.comparison` attached to `Census.acs5`. How would I go about reorganizing this code to make that happen? I’m thinking it has something to do with adding those methods to the `ACS5Client()` class, but… *TL;DR:* I don’t grok how these classes fit together, or really classes in general."

1289,1509630124.000121,Harlan,There’s a <#C07FJKDNH|kivy> channel in this team. I bet you could get a hand from someone there.; <@Kenny> It looks like the “Dp” could be done away with completely by just initializing the ACS{n}Client classes with the variables that the Dp classes supply.; Honestly there are a few things about that library that could be improved.

1289,1509630826.000401,Harlan,"<@Kenny> 
The first would probably to be break those classes out into more than one file called `core.py`. With a name like core it makes me think that they were going to add more files/break up the core file but then just didn’t.
The second would be all of the cryptic class names. I guess if you know the field/datasets they make sense, but they don’t to me. The names themselves would be fine, but they don’t have a single doc string in the whole file.
My other nitpick is the gratuitous use of whitespace. That’s just a style preference I have, but they have dozens of blank lines all over the place and I find it distracting and think it makes it harder to read."

1292,1509640034.000679,Ciera,If it's about flask / django it might be better to ask in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> or in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or more globally in <#C07EYDP25|webdev> :slightly_smiling_face:
1292,1509640075.000295,Blanche,"True, it's super entry level...Let me post the question and then if you think i should still head over there I will; What I’m making is a Key Performance Indicator dashboard, ideally in a web app.

I have a bunch of small scripts to preform the actions that I need, but would ideally like to have a user be able to click a button on the webpage, and that script is run on whatever computer is hosting the site. Flask or Django – I’m assuming I’ll be able to do this with Flask or Django?

I’m also using sqlite3 as the database – There may be many people looking at this page, but only ever 2 people editing. Will be small edits, but the likelihood of to people committing items to the database at the same time are very slim. Should this be alright, or should I be switching to something like postgr..Mysql, etc"
1292,1509640171.000046,Johana,Django and Flask views are python at the end of the day so you can execute whatever tasks you need.
1292,1509640250.000548,Blanche,"Perfect, any preference (and reason) that you would go with one over the other in this situation?"
1292,1509640318.000404,Johana,"my standard answer:

```
flask is really nice especially if you like sqlalchemy. it's one of the reasons i still build many things in flask. i think flask has some things that make it really easy to get started at the beginning but can also mislead you as well. flask is a microframework so it has to be built up in pieces (called extensions) and has a lot of flexibility. this flexibility can start to become an issue when your application grows and you get errors about circular imports. a good tip to start out with when building flask web applications is to be aware that there are two very important patterns when structuring your app: 
a) application factory
b) blueprints
a good project structure at the beginning doesn't hurt!

Django is an entire framework and has opinions of its own. Django has opinions on what template language and database orm you should use. Django will provide you with all the tools. It is possible to change template languages from Django to Jinja2. The biggest plus about Django is it's the most sought after developer position in the python web world. Django gives you everything you need in one place. That's the nice thing about Django is it has made a lot of decisions for you. This enforced structure allows you to be focused and very proficient. The Django Rest Framework is legendary in the Python world and makes it fun to build Rest apis and you also get a professional looking browsable api with it. When you work with Django you know it's a professional framework. That's why they say it's for, ""perfectionists with deadlines.""

It can never hurt to learn Django or any python web framework. There are a lot of the patterns that remain the same like MVC and these sorts of things.

One of the first times i entered the #pocoo channel on irc i saw a conversation between armin ronacher, the creator of flask, and someone else. armin said something that i can't forget. He said, ""flask will not make or break your project."" Both Django and Flask have excellent documentation and will appeal to different people. Why not try both?

Django and Flask are two web frameworks that help you solve problems in different ways. If you are new to python i recommend flask bc i think it gets you a lot for your milage at the beginning and once you get the hang of building applications moving on to Django or Pyramid is not an issue. The concepts you learn building a wsgi web application transfer to other wsgi applications. (edited)
```"
1292,1509640596.000272,Blanche,"Excellent answer, thank you"
1292,1509640726.000864,Johana,it’s probably one of more light handed flask vs django responses you’ll get.
1292,1509640886.000729,Blanche,"I have zero experience with either, so it's great. I'll start with flask, no harm eventually learning both"
1292,1509640967.000692,Johana,i’m mainly a flask dev but that wouldn’t stop me for applying for a django job. there may be some large gaps in my knowledge how things are done but the underlying concepts are the same :wink:.
1293,1509641764.000076,Blanche,Awesome...appreciate your responses
1293,1509641876.000114,Mallie,Anyone have a link to a PyCharm-flavored `pep8` config file?
1293,1509642038.000196,Frieda,? pycharm has pep8 built in; what are you needing?
1293,1509642066.00007,Johana,i think its for use outside of pycharm. that’s what it sounds like.
1293,1509642082.000031,Frieda,"i'm not 100% certain, but i think pycharm is just using `flake8` behind the scenes; maybe w/o the complexity algo"
1293,1509642294.000382,Johana,it uses pep8.py <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>

1293,1509642410.00063,Johana,me too lol
1293,1509642411.000223,Mallie,"PyCharm violates at least one default (line length), but maybe not others. If that is the only derivation that's easy then.; I'm brand new to PyCharm."
1293,1509642430.000758,Frieda,"eh, line length isn't the most important"
1293,1509642446.0003,Mallie,Do you know what max is in PyCharm?
1293,1509642459.000087,Frieda,nope. i don't even know if there is one
1293,1509642475.000397,Mallie,Ah I see it indicated but I'm so new I'm figuring out how to read it.
1293,1509642476.00027,Frieda,i just always turn on a right ruler in every editor
1293,1509642497.000005,Johana,the one they set for you automatically is 79 chars
1293,1509642567.000499,Mallie,"So mine came out-of-the-box at 120, found it.; I didn't change any Code Style settings."
1293,1509642595.000225,Frieda,79 is a good default. gives you a single character to wrap up with; embrace the `()`s for continuations and breaks
1293,1509642659.000133,Mallie,"I like that too, it's a project I don't manage but people use PyCharm, that's why I was trying to work it all out."
1293,1509642704.000571,Frieda,pycharm is a solid platform
1293,1509642720.000121,Mallie,"I've always verified with normal `flake`/`pep8`, so I didn't know why they were saying it was PEP8.; It looks like that is the only variation.; `pycodestyle --max-line-length=120` does the trick though"
1293,1509642912.000447,Harlan,"I always strive for 80, but if it’s cleaner to break the rule I’ll do it. If you’ve exceeded 110, 99.9% of the time it’s cleaner to break up the line."

1296,1509649369.00063,Ronni,"okay, there are a number of steps you might need to take here; first, you need to have a _compiled *.mo* file_ to actually use the translations; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#compiling-message-files>; then you need to change how you're setting the language; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference>; if you're using the request, it looks like you need to change the request header name - I've always used the 'standard' way of having the user make a selection from, say, a form, which sets a session variable for their language choice"

When I run it from the root of my app it goes through all my third party directories that have locale files and recreates .mo files for those as well. The problem is that this causes a ""plural forms expression could be dangerous"" value error because it is re-setting the plural-forms variable in some .po files"
1297,1509654470.000118,Ronni,"I don't think there is, but if you really need to compile only a specific file I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it with other tools; Django's tooling here is mostly porcelain around the gettext toolset"

1306,1509711171.000439,Rob,"any thoughts on best practice for variable names during a for each loop in python?

for i in items:
```
i is a terrible name because it's generally used for the index
```

for item in items
```
item is a poor choice because:
- refactoring tools may or may not be able to figure out 'item' needs to be changed if 'items' is renamed to something else.
- converting between plural and singular all the time is annoying and inconsistent.
- 'item' looks too similar to 'items'.
- if the list has a long name the nested code looks ugly. 
- if the loop is small, it's completely pointless and adds no value.
```

i kinda want to use ‘v’ or ‘e’ and just stick with it all the time, but nobody is doing this so i assume there is a reason for it?

1307,1509712819.00009,Ciera,what I usually do I name list with a plural so when doing `for i in my_list` I can use the singular; `for message in messages`

1307,1509713145.000452,Ciera,always using the same letter for indices will get confusing sometime; what if you have two loops ?
1307,1509713168.000122,Rob,"then i would give them descriptive names; but that case is rare enough that i don’t care, and i think in that case it actually adds a lot of value to be descriptive"

1307,1509713284.000309,Rob,i’m mostly talking about 1 level deep loops no longer than 10 lines. they come up all the time and i don’t think a descriptive name adds any value to the code at all
1307,1509713324.00006,Ciera,"then the convention is to use `i` and `k, v` for dict"
1307,1509713387.000095,Rob,"can we use i there? i’ve wanted to, i just haven’t because i thought it would be conflicting with the tradition of calling the index i; k, v i like a lot, consistent and easy :slightly_smiling_face:; i think i’m going to go with ‘i’ and if people complain i’ll blame you :wink:"

1332,1509977967.000006,Vada,It upsets me that we now have libraries to fix typehinting for other libraries; without actually bringing those changes into the problematic library
1332,1509978073.000334,Collette,"I doubt this problematic library will ever be actually fixed.; I understand the aws team's desire to avoid duplication of parameters, responses and documentation duplication; It's much simpler to generate classes and methods from an existing XML schema than to maintain a couple of dozens of fully documented SDKs"
1333,1509980620.000752,Dexter,"is there a specific channel for OpenCV projects, or should I ask here?"
1333,1509981193.00064,Meg,here is probably best
1333,1509981289.000563,Dexter,"cool; so i’ve got a basic face detection / recognition script; and it works great with a webcam; it detects all the faces just like it should; but for some reason, when using an IP camera feed, it can’t detect anything; the feed itself shows up fine in the resulting video window, every frame, every second; but it never is able to detect any faces; not sure what im doing wrong"
1333,1509981477.000489,Meg,"hmm, can you confirm that the image data is loading in your script?; maybe its coming in as a different format than the webcam?"
1333,1509981508.000141,Dexter,how do i confirm?; here are the relevant lines
1333,1509981549.000553,Meg,logging; debugger
1333,1509981559.00023,Sirena,or try recognizing somethign other than a face
1333,1509981559.000613,Dexter,"`video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(""<http://192.168.1.2/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi>"")`; ```while True:
    # Grab a single frame of video
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()

    # Resize frame of video to 1/4 size for faster face recognition processing
    small_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (0, 0), fx=0.25, fy=0.25)

    # Only process every other frame of video to save time

        face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(small_frame)
        face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(small_frame, face_locations)```; what should i output?; because this `cv2.imshow('Video', frame)` outputs the feed to my screen, and it looks fine; i see everything i expect to see; (meaning, the video feed)"
1333,1509981655.000024,Meg,"hmm; so, does that url require any kind of login?; or is it password protected?"
1333,1509981672.000031,Dexter,"nope….; and when the script is running, there’s a cv2 window that’s open, and it shows the feed from the camera perfectly; it just never seems to detect any faces"
1333,1509981703.000414,Meg,interesting
1333,1509981719.00026,Dexter,"and when i switch the feed to be my webcam, the exact same application works perfectly"
1333,1509981719.000564,Meg,do you know how to debug python?
1333,1509981730.000583,Dexter,"not so much, im just getting started; should i get pycharm?"
1333,1509981765.00021,Meg,what I suspect is the feed from the IP camera is different in some way from the web camera; the cv2 window showing the feed probably knows how to handle the difference; but the face detection script doesn’t
1333,1509981821.000159,Dexter,hmmm
1333,1509981826.000079,Meg,"so, in this case, an IDE with a debugger would probably help"
1333,1509981834.000568,Dexter,interesting…..is there a way to convert the “read” frame into some other format?
1333,1509981836.000378,Meg,"short of that, put in logging statements in your face detector code"
1333,1509981840.000407,Dexter,can u recommend an ide?
1333,1509981854.000613,Meg,"I like pycharm, and think you would get by fine with the free version; and as far as conversions, you would have to dig in the opencv documentation for that"
1333,1509981952.000353,Sirena,"if you don't want to jump into an IDE right this moment, you can also insert python debugger statements and debug on the cmd line, if that somehow sounds preferable to you; otherwise, I second <@Meg>'s vote for pycharm"
1333,1509982046.000086,Ciera,ipdb is a good interactive debugger
1333,1509982048.000253,Dexter,k…setting up pycharm now
1333,1509982051.000166,Ciera,in cmd line
1333,1509982059.000166,Dexter,"will try the breakpoint on the read, and see if i can determine the frame format; standby; how do i add a python interpreter; in the build configuration; the dropdown is empty and i can’t see where to add anything; nvm i got it; ok; i set my interpreter to python 3.6; when i try to debug my script; it breaks in this file; <https://cl.ly/1R1B0y363b0r>; anyone know why?; the exec line has a breakpoint (that i didn’t set), when i hit continue, python either crashes or it just ends"
1333,1509982725.00018,Meg,did you right click in the editor window and select run as debug?
1333,1509982739.000601,Dexter,yes; yes; it hits a breakpoint right here; <https://cl.ly/0H0K0K162V07>
1333,1509982900.000595,Meg,and what’s the error output when you resume?
1333,1509982905.0004,Dexter,"nothing, it just ends"
1333,1509982915.00051,Meg,nothing in debug console?
1333,1509982917.000314,Ciera,would it be possible to split the line in multiple line N; like first the compile then the exec
1333,1509983079.000344,Dexter,"ah, wasn’t looking at the console output; standby fixing an error; ok; working; breakpoint after the `read` statement; it’s not telling me much about format though; soi; i think ur theory <@Meg> is probably correct; do u know of the method to convert a “frame” to another format?"
1333,1509983325.000567,Meg,that’s where you have to dig into the documentation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1333,1509983333.000374,Dexter,struggling; hate their documentation; still no luck here
1334,1509982750.000332,Meg,same error?; oh.. is that your file or is it something else?
1334,1509982945.000382,Ciera,and maybe see what is being compiled first
1334,1509984265.000528,Dexter,if anyone has any ideas i’d be much appreciative!
1335,1509984992.000382,Grayce,"Hello, definitely a newbie here. I'm trying to get values from a JSON file and part of my code is this:
`json_data = json.load(init_deployment)`
however, this returns 
`AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iteritems'`

and when I try to change it to json.*loads*, I get this error:
`TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not 'TextIOWrapper'`"
1335,1509985031.000474,Toby,how do you define init_deployment?; `init_deployment = open(&lt;pathToFile&gt;)`?
1335,1509985098.000367,Grayce,"Here:
```
init_deployment = 'C:\\Tests\\deployment.json'

1335,1509985312.000191,Collette,"<@Grayce> how do you use `json_data`?; There should be some sort of `.iteritems` call; (btw, switch to py3 already, we're in 2017 :slightly_smiling_face: )"
1335,1509985366.000081,Toby,py2 has better plugin support
1335,1509985379.000454,Grayce,"<@Toby> I just tried it and still returns the same error. But still, thanks!; I have it on my for e in json_data, hold one, I'll just try something out. Thanks!"
1335,1509985542.000212,Collette,"`e in json_data` means ""iterate over the dictionary keys"", which keys are strings, thus e is a string"
1335,1509985564.000518,Toby,plus it depends what shes using it for
1335,1509985578.000419,Collette,"<@Toby> that's simply not true for a couple of years already.; More than that, there are py3-only libraries.; For instance, I'm making one right now"
1335,1509985653.000613,Lory,I am still gripping onto 2.7 like my life depends on it lol

1335,1509985881.00072,Collette,What should this link provide us?; OTOH there are <http://py3readiness.org/> and <https://python3wos.appspot.com/>
1335,1509985919.000661,Toby,look under the `Which version should I use?` section
1335,1509985992.000062,Collette,"So... the vast majority of active libraries are ported to py3, there are py3-only libraries, and you still think that if you have an external dependency you'd better go with py2?; What are you going to do past 2020?; Are you still on ubuntu 8.04, by the way? Next year py3 will be literally 10 years old"
1335,1509986123.000294,Toby,"dont use ubuntu, i use windows like normal devs who dont dev for tinkerboards"
1335,1509986171.000418,Collette,"Okay, I guess you're still using Windows XP then.; <@Grayce> have you managed to resolve your issue?"
1335,1509986268.000213,Toby,im on windows 10... anyone who uses 7 or older needs to get an upgrade or their pc removing from them
1335,1509986412.000895,Collette,then your opinions about versioning and supporting old versions of software are quite inconsistent ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1335,1509986442.000859,Toby,im not on about supporting old os' tho
1335,1509986459.000041,Collette,"So to speak, I have windows 7 on my gaming machine. And I won't upgrade to 10, unless it's un-shitted"
1335,1509986470.000056,Toby,oh god...; update to 10 already
1335,1509986502.00032,Collette,"Python 3 is great, that's what makes it different from windows 10 :slightly_smiling_face: Anyway, that's a topic for <#C07EFN21K|random>; We can go there if you'd like to continue"

1336,1509990039.000139,Ernestina,"Hey guys question. when defining a class, why does it need to have `self` in the methods?; for example: 
```class Dataset(object):
  def __init__(self, name, path, schema, type, prefix, primaryKey, separator='\t', header=None):
    self.name = name  # in format abacus_dataset_name
    self.path = path
    self.schema = schema
    self.type = type
    self.prefix = prefix
    self.primaryKey = primaryKey
    self.separator = separator
    self.header = header

  def show(self):
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('name = {}'.format(self.name))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('path = {}'.format(self.path))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('type = {}'.format(self.type))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('prefix = {}'.format(self.prefix))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('primaryKey = {}'.format(self.primaryKey))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('schema = {}'.format(self.schema))
```"
1336,1509990068.000557,Frieda,`self` refers to the instance that's calling the class method
1336,1509990069.000059,Ernestina,why does show(self) need to be that way; Got it
1336,1509990104.000715,Frieda,"it doesn't _have_ to be `self`, either; `def show(this):` works just as well; but you'll get weird looks"
1336,1509990320.000091,Meg,"the `why` for that is convention; coming from java, where `this` is the same as `self`, and is implicit to classes, was a big context switch for me"
1336,1509990471.000034,Collette,and the fact lots of java devs really _like_ that they can omit `this`
1336,1509990486.000134,Frieda,also different from javascript in that `self` never changes what it points to. it's always the instance
1336,1509990539.000118,Junita,"yeah that’s something I like about Python - things like are usually more explicit, there’s less magic"
1336,1509990605.000458,Frieda,we keep our magic contained inside of underscores
1336,1509990611.00019,Junita,heh
1336,1509990713.000396,Ciera,I wonder how it would feel to find code where the author doesn't use `self` but something completely irrelevant; like `banana`
1336,1509990758.000051,Junita,"I have come across code where the author used other things than self, and it was jarring to say the least; it at least vaguely made sense"
1336,1509990768.000423,Frieda,"<@Ciera> try it yourself for a day :smile:; on a branch, of course"
1336,1509990786.000495,Ciera,no sure the code review will go ok :smile:
1336,1509990835.000191,Winnifred,lol
1336,1509990861.000434,Frieda,conventions are a great thing on issues that don't really matter

1336,1509991070.000435,Ciera,Using `class.__name__` as `self` could make sense :thinking_face:
1336,1509991107.000197,Porsha,how?
1336,1509991148.000113,Frieda,i'd constantly think you were trying to be clever with class methods; ...but then notice the lack of `@classmethod` and wonder how the hell you got that to work
1336,1509991183.000395,Collette,`@bananamethod`
1336,1509991194.000009,Ciera,using `self` in `classmethod` would be the worst :smile:

1337,1509994278.000624,Seema,"true, but don't you/ didn't you teach python at college level?"
1337,1509994290.000706,Frieda,i taught for <http://teamtreehouse.com|teamtreehouse.com>; so everyone from 11 year olds to 90 year olds; all education levels and such too; i keep thinking about trying to get in as a teacher for a community college or something but that's a heck of a pay cut. hard to do that w/ kids and mortgage
1337,1509994378.000673,Seema,"<@Max> you are effectively running a non-for-profit business with this idea, selling it, hoping for consumers, just no money.  I would recommend finding some test customers and trying it out on them, seeing what other colleges have tried, seeing where the need is as well as finding focusing your attention to a narrow group.; where's the emoji for ""I hear you on that one""..."
1337,1509994432.000637,Frieda,state university would probably be alright so long as i wasn't just an adjunct; but i don't necessarily have the qualifications
1337,1509994497.000439,Seema,"In California, the community college professors were killing it awhile ago.  The state and UC professors were not thrilled.  Focus certainly mattered but the three tier system can be skewed"
1337,1509994720.0005,Max,<@Seema> thank you for your suggestion. we are just a group of college students trying to teach each other. I just want a professional in the field to look through our curated content list and approve.

1337,1509994906.000154,Lory,glad to see we weren't the only ones at least. We've had DNS attacks in the past
1337,1509994919.000077,Seema,"DNS is resolving for me, but loading is literally hit or miss, some sites boom, other sides, clockwise for a long time"

1340,1509998597.000353,Delicia,You'd call it as a method of a `Goat` instance
1340,1509998792.000324,Ernestina,"Makes sense now. SO when initinating a new object , in this case `goat`, it automatically called the self.beat()"

1342,1510004474.000693,Ernestina,So when to use static method vs class method.; anyone can help?
1342,1510004688.000178,Frieda,"According to the numbers I've seen, yes; Public teachers are paid pretty badly"
1342,1510004817.000165,Suellen,"staticmethod when it could as well be a function elsewhere, but conceptually fits in the class"
1342,1510004832.000127,Genesis,damn...
1342,1510004884.000282,Suellen,"classmethod is for when you need a class object, not any instance in particular. For example when you want to create an instance yourself, like `__init__` does."
1342,1510004910.000219,Frieda,and Treehouse was a full time job with decent benefits and a not-too-bad salary
1342,1510004913.000543,Suellen,that's my take :stuck_out_tongue:
1342,1510004941.000344,Frieda,"you almost never actually _need_ `@staticmethod`. it's more about organization, like <@Suellen> said."
1342,1510004979.000331,Ciera,or because pycharm is complaining :smile:
1342,1510005040.0004,Suellen,so true
1342,1510005069.00034,Ernestina,I don’t get the pycharm is complaning part haha; I use databricks and jupyter notebook
1342,1510005634.000175,Seema,"<@Ernestina> pycharm attempts to help from the install and some of it's help is welcome, but there's pretty much a little bulb that is trying to suggest *something* all the time unless you tweak it to be quiet"
1343,1510007794.00022,Vena,"I'm doing something with each file contained in a directory. If the file is not found, how can I say, ""that's okay, go to the next one?"""
1344,1510008223.00033,Frieda,"check if the path exists, if so, do what you want; if the path doesn't exist, your loop should just continue on its own"
1344,1510008340.00024,Ciera,or catch the error and continue
1344,1510008381.000405,Frieda,"yeah, that should throw `FileNotFoundError`"
1344,1510008389.00004,Ciera,checking the path might not work if something else is moving the files around
1344,1510008405.000383,Frieda,well you'd have to use the path to access the file anyway so...
1344,1510008491.000305,Ciera,yeah but it's an habit to take. It could be possible that something else move/delete the file between the time you check for the path and the time you access th efile
1344,1510008970.000077,Frieda,true
1344,1510009570.000115,Myong,"Does anyone know why a program would run in debug but not normally? I'm using a Raspberry Pi and attempting to use signal.pause() to await an interrupt to occur, but it won't work normally running it, however in debug it works fine"
1344,1510009658.000353,Frieda,"<@Vena> don't do naked `except`s like that. they'll swallow _all_ errors that the encapsulated code throws and you won't know if something breaks in a new/unexpected way; also, try to _only_ do code that might throw an exception in the `try` block; ```
try:
    f = open(filename, 'r')
except (FileNotFoundError, OSError):
    failed_files.append(file)
else:
    # do stuff with f
```; <@Myong> ""in debug""?"
1344,1510009898.000256,Myong,While debugging.; But it doesn't seem to be the issue. Signal.pause() just won't detect the press; But if I step to just before pause the presses are detected
1344,1510009991.0001,Vena,<@Frieda> Interesting. Got it. Thanks.
1344,1510010045.000097,Frieda,"<@Myong> sorry, no idea."
1344,1510010120.000076,Marcie,<@Myong> does it do the same thing on another linux system?
1344,1510010139.000326,Myong,I can't check at the moment it's the only Linux system I have; I tried `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`; Doesn't work with using `while True: time.sleep(1)`
1344,1510010324.000001,Marcie,check to see if anything for `signal.getsignal(2)` return anythings beforehand
1344,1510010945.000052,Myong,Like so?
1344,1510011030.00023,Marcie,"i believe so yeah, you generally just want to check that you're setup to handle a signal"
1344,1510011110.000016,Myong,It brings up an object for signal handler; I mispoke; Maybe I could try GPIO native add callback
1345,1510011063.000021,Marcie,pause internally uses `signal(2)` which itself is normally fine on x86 linux systems but gets weird once you start working on other hardware :disappointed:
1346,1510012075.000282,Iluminada,Hello guys! any recommendations in dealing with time series data that has one insertion each day? I am currently using postgres and django
1347,1510012083.000003,Leon,"Hi all. I'm trying to write a loop along the lines of `for number in numbers`. Sometimes numbers will contain multiple values and be a tuple `('1', '2')` but other times it may just be a single number. When it's just a single number, python is splitting the number. Ie: 12 becomes `[1, 2]`. Does anyone know how to work around this issue?"
1347,1510012220.000005,Frieda,you'd need to detect whether it's a number or tuple first
1347,1510012334.000052,Corrinne,Paste a small snippet of your code and the outupt :slightly_smiling_face:
1347,1510012407.000088,Leon,"```    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(','); The code takes a parameter of event= where the value could be a single diget (ie: 21) or multiple comma separate digits (21, 22, 23 etc):
```
    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(',')
```

Further down I want to loop over these, regardless of whether it's a single value or multiple:
```
    for event_id in event_ids:
        event = misp.get_event(event_id)
        print event
```

The problem is that if it's a single value (ie: 21) then python will split the string and instead loop over with a value of '2',  and then '1'."
1347,1510012612.000187,Marcie,"you can use split on a string to get a list even if theres nothing to split on; ```In [1]: '21'.split(',')
Out[1]: ['21']

In [2]: '21,22'.split(',')
Out[2]: ['21', '22']```; so just always split the `event_ids` string and you'll be able to iterate over single or multiple values"
1347,1510012725.000176,Leon,<@Marcie> spot on! That's now working as expected. Thanks very much.
1347,1510012733.000077,Marcie,:toot:
1347,1510012744.000015,Leon,... and removes the need for that if statement to boot :slightly_smiling_face:
1347,1510012752.000365,Marcie,yup!; <@Sharika> are you able to select that element in the chrome devtool if you turn javascript off?; that's what i'd reckon yeah; if its not being rendered serverside then that react-root points to it being a react component and thus won't exist in the DOM without splash
1347,1510015923.000182,Twila,Hy buddys; Someone know how can i get linkedin profile picture; for use it in django?; There is a specific url for that?
1347,1510016084.000101,Marcie,there's an entire API for it yeah <https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/rest-api#>; you're likely after some of the data in the profile endpoint: <https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/fields/basic-profile>

1349,1510023648.000166,Collette,<@So> you're making a GET request instead of POST somehow

1349,1510023977.000066,Collette,You need to figure that out.; The problem is clearly on the frontend.
1349,1510024036.000172,Lory,"look at the form itself that's sending the data, what `method` attribute are you using?"
1349,1510024076.000109,So,"```let id = response.data.user.id

i just solved the problem puting JWT"
1349,1510024086.000055,Lory,"if not defined, it will default to a `GET` request, you have to define `method='POST'` in order to send a post request"

```"
1349,1510024345.000087,Lory,you can import them as modules and execute them that way
1349,1510024378.000024,So,"from path import x
from path import y"
1349,1510024439.000235,Burma,the python scripts would be in the same directory as the main.py would this cause a conflict ?
1349,1510024485.000187,Lory,as long as they aren't named something that takes precedence over another module
1349,1510024501.000005,So,"from yourmodule import x
from yourmodule import y; if same path"
1349,1510024538.000208,Burma,sounds good I'll give it a try
1349,1510024545.000153,Lory,"so like the time module, if you name a py file `time.py` within that directory then trying to import pythons time module wouldn't work"

1349,1510024754.000097,So,thanks <@Lory>
1349,1510024960.000103,Lory,yea pythons import system is fairly simple once yo understand how it works. It just seems daunting because it seems to work like magic to a beginner. At least that's how I felt haha
1349,1510025124.000228,Burma,haha yea Foresure I'll stick with it :sweat_smile:

1366,1510163648.000409,Richelle,"OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.  The goal: Take a list of list of strings (results of a query from a SQL database), (hopefully) compress it, and ship it to an Azure blob storage as .tsv files.  All in memory.  The azure-storage library has a create_blob_from_stream option which I've successfully used to send a `io.BytesIO` stream (without compressing) and it works as intended, although I think it could be cleaned up.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding the various pieces of the `io` standard library and want to get some suggestions on how to improve things.  I can't seem to get the compression working (tried zipfile and gzip) and I run into issue where I'll open(..., 'w') the GzipFile/ZipFile, write contents to it, but then can't send it to blob because it doesn't have read access (because I opened it with write to add to the compressed file?); Trying to keep it as lightweight as possible since it's going to be running on an RPi (hence the trying to avoid writing to disk aspect); The compression might be optional if the overhead of compressing isn't worth doing it (to lower the bandwidth), I was going to test doing it with/without and see if it was worth the tradeoff in time spent sending it to blob uncompressed vs compressed).  I can't imagine the overhead is a lot but I honestly have no clue and I'm trying to not prematurely optimize before needed.  Would love thoughts from anyone who's more familiar with this stuff"
1366,1510163972.000695,Meg,"so I guess my first question would be, does this work without compression?"
1366,1510164049.000431,Richelle,"Yes.  It feels super hacky, and I'm not sure BytesIO is what I ultimately want to be using, but it works.; Everything I'm reading makes it seem like I should be using StringIO, but then I get a 'bytes' related error (after removing all the obvious byte things I'm doing in that snippet); Or maybe TextIOWrapper? That seems more like for loading from a file on disk rather than a stream"
1366,1510164570.000371,Meg,you could look into temporary files; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>
1366,1510165199.000499,Richelle,Doesn't that create temporary files on the disk potentially?
1366,1510165310.000625,Meg,"and is cleaned up after you close; so if you create it within a context manager, eg `with open(temp_file)`, it cleans up when the block finishes"
1366,1510165414.000478,Richelle,"Is a potential option, except we don't want to write anything to disk at all unless we really have to.  Mostly because with RPi's will burn out the SD card with constant read/writes which normally isn't a problem with most applications"

Maybe I need to do something like open a stream `f`, with `gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, 'w')` add the relevant row elements to that Gzip, which maybe puts that compressed stuff into the stream f?; Right now I think I'm adding things to the stream, then somehow trying to zip it up after the fact; Ahahaha, that was it!; Something just clicked about streams"

Now I'm making a webscraper, and as I find new things to add to my db, I want to make sure they're not already in my db. My first thought is that I can just use a try/catch as my way of telling whether it's unique or not. My question is whether this is a good idea or not. I can't really articulate why, but it  just feels to me like this isn't really the intended use of try/catch and it's a bit hackish. Is using try/catch in this way a bad design choice?; I mean I can loop through the table or whatever and check like that, but it feels like that's going to be slower than the exception way"

1369,1510169972.000095,Richelle,"As a followup to my earlier confusion about streams like `io.BytesIO`, when does this stream ""empty"" out?  I found myself reusing the same stream object over many iterations of a loop, but wasn't finding any issues even when using `seek(0)` about data being duplicated.  I'd rather be safe than sorry, but I'd like to understand it's behavior a little more"
1369,1510170105.000002,Meg,"as I understand it, when you do `seek(0)`, it moves the pointer to the 0th byte of the stream.  so when any writes happen, the bytes before that get overwritten; but conversely, it also means the bytes after still exist"
1369,1510170768.000217,Richelle,"So what i'm doing currently is: write to stream, seek(0), then send that stream somewhere else (like azure blob in my case), then repeat for the next thing in my list using the same stream.  I'm not currently getting any duplicate data, but it feels wrong.  I think I'm going to switch it so it's using a fresh `BytesIO` object each time, since some initial googling tells me that making a new stream is just easier than worrying about reusing an old one"
1369,1510170803.000511,Meg,makes sense
1369,1510170806.000231,Richelle,"Mostly it feels wrong because the next time I did seek(0) I would expect to see duplicate data (the stuff from the first iteration of the loop, plus the stuff for the current loop)"
1369,1510170822.00026,Meg,because the old stream will be garbage collected when all references don’t exist

I am thinking of using it this way ```        delete_func = getattr(foo, ""delete"", _fallback_delete_function)

1400,1510509351.000094,Lorean,"Hi, in my project I have a model called Project and a view where you can see those projects. My problem is, I don't know how to set up the view so that I can have rows with two objects per row (I'm using bootstrap and it looks nice that way); Maybe I should specify that I'm using Django"
1401,1510515908.000016,Charisse,How can I integrate React with Django? Which package is the best for the integration? I want to show model data to front-end.
1401,1510528662.000008,Seema,"They was a package highlighted in Talk Python to Me recently that does this exact thing and even more complex stuff like William for Bill and McDonalds and MCDONALD'S , bahhh!!!!, cannot remember the package.  (I'm stuck shopping for kids clothes so I'll go see if I can find it); Bah, it might not to be such a good for you though it might provide inspiration , <https://github.com/datamade/probablepeople/blob/master/README.md>"
1402,1510519765.000077,Leanna,"Hey Peeps,
Have a question, I am parsing some json which looks like the following:
```
[{""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""SSSBBBEEE""}
{""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
This is stored as a simple list containing multiple dictionary objects. From here, my next step is to find an algorithm of some sort that can traverse through each title key in each dictionary and find similar or exact matches. If there are more than one matches or similar titles, then put the matches into a family, eventually yielding a set of family objects containing the matched tiles. With this in mind, if I execute the json listed above I expect to return:
```
['Set A': {""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""AAABBBEEE""}] ,

['Set B': {""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
Where both sets A &amp; B contain dictionaries where the title key values can be found by a) finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and b) finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately. I am thinking of incorporating an adaptation of some fuzzy matching algorithm, such as the Levenshtein distance Algorithm, but feel I could make this a lot simpler, does anyone have any alternative suggestions or ideas for me to look up? Would appreciate it greatly."
1402,1510524651.000049,Meg,"what I would do is make a class, and add in the id and title to the class on init.  Implement your comparison algorithm as a method.  eg, `def levenshtein` that takes in a string and returns the edit distance; so you can initialize a list of instances, and then filter it by the result of the edit distances"

1420,1510690475.000413,Myong,"Hey guys, I got a quick and probably simple issue at the moment. I'm writing a program to process .pcapng files to look at the packet data. The program has time frames which are given a timeout time. This timeout time is checked every time a new packet is read. The issue I'm having is, the .pcapng `timestamp` gives a pretty long float value which equates to a date obviously. For some reason, even after setting the timeout to also be a float, the loop goes a bit further than it should. The first packet in the timeframe sets the next time frame variable so that when `next_time_frame &lt;= timestamp` (this is the check I do every time a new packet comes in) a new next_time_frame is set and a I do other things. So for example if the first timestamp is 1385856000.00000, then `next_time_frame` would be 1385856060.00000, but for some reason, the loop doesn't stop when that statement is true.; So basically comparing two floats to each other isn't working properly; Nevermind it works now."

1425,1510734964.000069,Jule,"<@Ciera> Yeah... since it was ""Django"" - related.. but also a ""help"" - question... I posted in both channels... :slightly_smiling_face:
Is that OK ?"
1425,1510735131.00004,Ciera,We prefer people to post in the most relevant channel (<#C0LMFRMB5|django> in this case) and if you don't get any response after a while share your message in channels with a wider audience. And we try to push people to use the share feature so there is no two simultaneous discussion as it links to your initial message :slightly_smiling_face:; But don't worry it's ok :wink:
1425,1510735304.000278,Jule,OK... will make sure to do that next time  :slightly_smiling_face:
1425,1510742638.000408,Vada,although you normally want to protect sensitive information especially for prod
1426,1510740896.000153,Georgetta,"which is the better way to save configuration on django? for example for connection with database or configuration of email, actually i use the settings.py"
1426,1510742625.000106,Vada,<@Georgetta> yes in setting.py; I'll explain more in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
1427,1510748650.000203,Carroll,"Have anyone here worked with bcrypt and postgres? I'm having trouble storing my hashed &amp; salted password in my postgres database using SQLAlchemy; Heroku logs aren't showing any useful info, works locally with sqlite3 though."
1427,1510748711.000202,Suellen,it's best to replicate your production locally; i.e. use postgres for dev too
1427,1510748749.000442,Carroll,I think it's a problem with the data type; Right now I'm using string
1427,1510748758.000029,Suellen,"sqlite is very different, some thing might work in dev and not in prod, and others work in prod and not in dev"
1427,1510748788.000189,Carroll,"I see that some people say here that you should convert the password bytes to a string first; Or using BYTEA; ""I had a similar problem and I solved it using BYTEA data type at the Postgresql. I think problem occurs while writing byte array into VARCHAR datatype in Postgre. This might be related to database encoding and the details of that conversion from byte to varchar.""; Could that be it?"
1427,1510748812.000154,Suellen,I use db.String(64) or something; algorithm is bcrypt too
1427,1510748821.000137,Joann,Storing as bytea would almost certainly be more efficient.
1427,1510748844.000138,Suellen,<@Joann> even if `bcrypt(something)` is a string?
1427,1510748846.00003,Joann,"Unfortunately, not all client libraries make that very easy."
1427,1510748855.000206,Carroll,That's my usermodel; Then I have a db.py file
1427,1510748883.000376,Joann,"leovp: well, you'd ideally want to have it be a binary string since that's going to be smaller than a binary-string-encoded-as-text"
1427,1510748893.000066,Carroll,and for making heroku work:
1427,1510748963.000223,Suellen,"<@Joann> that's true, but unfortunately even low-level `bcrypt` returns a readable ascii string (or a bytes object, but still 2x the size); and other higher level libraries just use what they have been given; <@Carroll> looks ok, you really have to debug the issue itself"
1427,1510749027.000129,Carroll,Yea
1427,1510749030.000085,Suellen,i.e. what is the issue exactly?
1427,1510749039.000411,Carroll,"I'm not sure, when I try to run this snippet; I have an endpoint /register"
1427,1510749047.000311,Suellen,"your app complains about the password, or sqlalchemy? or underlying driver?"
1427,1510749069.000011,Joann,"leovp: which is terribly silly, really.  Still, you could at least save on-disk size by having the data type be a bytea and then sending the base64 or hex-encoded string to PG wrapped in a conversion function to turn it into a proper bytea."
1427,1510749074.000257,Carroll,It hits the exception block; What message can I get out of e?; e.message wouldn't work
1427,1510749113.000247,Suellen,"str(e), repr(e), anything really"
1427,1510749123.000179,Carroll,Alright; Will deploy it and see what problem it is
1427,1510749136.000185,Joann,"Wouldn't help with network traffic since you'd be sending the hex-encoded string over the wire instead of the binary data, but saving space on disk and in memory is certainly valuable from a database perspective."
1427,1510749137.000247,Suellen,otherwise it's really not clear
1427,1510749184.000274,Joann,"(the function you'd use for storing the data into a PG bytea would actually be 'decode', 'encode' would be used to pull the data back out)"
1427,1510749204.000073,Suellen,"<@Joann> I guess no one in Flask/Django/etc world sees it as an issue, because a password column is rarely even 10% of a table size.
Maybe top players like Instagram do care, but I don't know"
1427,1510749236.000041,Joann,"eh, it just grates against me when people store binary data as text because it's such a waste of space."
1427,1510749239.00022,Carroll,Uhm okey; dafuq
1427,1510749261.00015,Joann,The gitlab folks have made an effort to start storing their git hashes as bytea's because it really does make a difference in space.
1427,1510749270.000011,Suellen,I understand you entirely :))
1427,1510749270.00015,Carroll,oh my god; I think I get it; -.-; I'm a freaking idiot
1427,1510749282.000396,Suellen,:tada:
1427,1510749302.000312,Carroll,I changed the length of the db model; But never actually reset the heroku postgres database; ......; Any of you got a rope so I can hang myself?
1427,1510749340.000159,Joann,"leovp: With enough rows, every byte matters. :)"
1427,1510749446.000394,Suellen,"I guess you would want to know that I store IPs in INET :slightly_smiling_face:; not as a string, which is _very_ common"
1427,1510749491.000318,Joann,"well, I'd probably recommend ip4r there; Though it depends on your requirements."
1427,1510749518.000146,Suellen,:open_mouth:
1427,1510749524.000429,Carroll,Would you look at that! It works :smile:
1427,1510749526.000241,Suellen,Let me just google it
1427,1510749565.00019,Carroll,"Right, now it's a problem with the auth :joy:"
1427,1510749570.000241,Suellen,<@Joann> is it in 10.0 or 9.x?
1427,1510749596.000293,Joann,leovp: <https://github.com/RhodiumToad/ip4r>; It's an extension that works with lots of versions of PG
1427,1510749622.000058,Suellen,I see. It's a bit harder to pitch
1427,1510749638.000307,Joann,"Unlike inet, it segregates ip4 vs. ip6, but it's much more efficient at storage and allows more indexing options"
1427,1510749658.000062,Suellen,"I don't think INET is that bad currently, as we don't really perform operations on IPs frequently (or at all)"
1427,1510749659.000132,Joann,(an ip4 address is actually stored as a 32bit unsigned integer..)
1427,1510749707.000312,Suellen,"And we do have a bunch ipv6 addresses stored, which would require `ipaddress` which is probably not much better than `INET`; still, good to know :slightly_smiling_face:"
1427,1510749803.000447,Joann,"well, or you could store ipv6 addresses as ip6 :); but, yeah, definitely something good to know about; and it's quite stable and well maintained."
1427,1510749905.000194,Suellen,i.e. split each mixed IP columns into two?; that doesn't seem nice :confused:; or store ipv4 as a ipv6 as well? will postgres understand that `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:10a` requires 4 bytes instead of 8?
1427,1510750245.000055,Carroll,"Okey; <@Suellen> I'm really new to this crypto approach; This worked fine; Register now works; But, if we look in auth; Without encoding both, I got an error saying they must be encoded; So I encoded both with utf8, and I got this error message"
1427,1510750405.000212,Suellen,hm; where is this exception from?; `bcrypt.checkpw` returns true or false
1427,1510750650.000385,Carroll,Exception is from the auth
1427,1510751068.000251,Joann,"leovp: no, PG would store an ipv6 address as an ipv6 address"
1427,1510751080.00025,Patty,"<@Carroll> since you are doing utf8 going into the db, you don’t need to re-encode it after pulling it from the db"
1427,1510751094.00033,Joann,"leovp: You could have different tables rather than different columns, though it depends on your exact data model, of course."
1427,1510751100.000029,Carroll,It raised an error when I tried to do that; Maybe I have to decode it?
1427,1510751115.000231,Joann,"leovp: I will note that storing NULLs are basically free unless you're careful to not have any NULLs at all in your tuples.; (in which case, PG can avoid storing the NULL bitmap at all)"
1427,1510751289.000147,Carroll,<@Patty> I need that u?
1427,1510751415.000015,Suellen,"<@Joann> This is just a bit too different, storing different types of addresses separately. :confused:; <@Carroll> I think the point was that `checkpw` doesn't raise an exception"
1427,1510751464.000363,Patty,"No you don’t need the u, that’s just demonstrating it’s a Unicode string "
1427,1510751470.000227,Joann,"leovp: eh, they actually are disjoint tho, really, but if it works for you.. :)"
1427,1510751481.00028,Patty,Sorry trying to get a snippet over but I’m in the middle of switching trains :)
1427,1510751490.000133,Carroll,Hehe; I am using Heroku with Postgres though
1427,1510751525.000091,Patty,Are you still encoding the password before putting it in the dB?
1427,1510751528.000461,Carroll,I am
1427,1510751546.000367,Patty,And did you clear out the original hashed value that wasn’t encoded?
1427,1510751567.000324,Carroll,I did this
1427,1510751703.000013,Patty,Right but did you re-create the stored pw with that code?
1427,1510751722.000309,Carroll,Yes; I registered a new user; Trying auth; Brb making noodles
1427,1510752027.000579,Patty,And just to check you redeployed your heroku app with the changes for creating hashes?
1427,1510752531.000497,Carroll,I did; Am I doing something obviously wrong here? :slightly_smiling_face:; the bcrypt.checkpw
1429,1510755310.000716,Season,"Hi, Python newbie here with probably a dumb question...  I am trying to use the Google API examples to get some code running that will send an email from my app since port 587 is blocked on the company network.  I am very close but I am running into some issues where the example code has included some logic for backwards compatibility with python 2.6.    I get compile errors because the syntax is incorrect inside an IF block.  I am coding on OSX with Python 2.7 and my IDE is LiClipse.
Here is the code in question and I get an error on the third line from the bottom where it wants ""tools.run(flow, store)"" to be ""tools.run_flow(flow, store)"" 
```     if not credentials or credentials.invalid:
        flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets(CLIENT_SECRET_FILE, SCOPES)
        flow.user_agent = APPLICATION_NAME
        if flags:
            credentials = tools.run_flow(flow, store, flags)
        else: # Needed only for compatibility with Python 2.6
            credentials = tools.run(flow, store)
        print('Storing credentials to ' + credential_path)
    return credentials  ```
Any Ideas for me?; I went to get the compile error to post here and all of a sudden I am not getting an error on that line.  WTF?"
1429,1510756072.000375,Meg,"I guess my first question would be why support 2.6?; the last release of 2.6 was the .9 minor release back in 2013, and it hasn’t been supported since then"

1429,1510757336.000008,Sirena,"well, if anyone is still running CentOS6, they've got 2.6; and it's semi-irritating to load a different version since the OS uses 'python' to run its package updater, and if it's not 2.6, it barfs.; I uh.... have a friend with that problem.... yeah."
1429,1510757479.000408,Vada,why would it not be 2.6?
1429,1510757871.000513,Meg,uhm that shouldn’t stop you from installing 2.7 or 3.x; just leave system python alone and create virtualenvs mapped to the specific python interpreter version
1429,1510758412.000206,Jenise,running centos you can use the IUS repository (<https://ius.io/GettingStarted/>) to easily install python versions if you don't want to use the system default one

My intention for the final version is that it will, from a gui, request input from the user, use that data to query sql, then dump the result in another gui window.; Am I headed in the right direction with this?; anything I should consider.

For example I tried ot adapt parts of this example but I obviously didn't understand what I was doing because I coudlnt get it to work.  I have since thrown out my atttempts and put it back to how google had it so done really have specific examples of what I tried. ``` import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')
parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+',
                   help='an integer for the accumulator')

                   help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')

1431,1510768423.000473,Antionette,"What could have been the issue there is that `flags` refers to the parsed arguments rather than the parser itself since the google code you posted has the `parse_args` function being called directly on the `ArgumentParser` instance, whereas you need to call `add_argument` on the parser itself.  So you could save the `ArgumentParser` to its own parser variable, then add your custom arguments, and then call the `parse_args` yourself rather than in the spot its called in google's example"
1431,1510770107.000355,Season,<@Antionette> Thanks. Thats what I was trying to do but couldn't get it to work.  I decided to move on because calling it from bash isn't a requirement for today and I'm in a crunch.  When I get back to it I'll post my specific failing syntax.

1436,1510803844.000109,Myong,What's up guys. I have a quick question. So I'm processing a large pcap file that so far has gone through 22 million packets. Now at some point the amount of data I need to collect is going to get way too large. I eventually have to store all the data I gather from this on a frontend webpage. Would sqlite be something to use?
1436,1510804589.00014,Marcie,<@Myong> generally depends on how you're going to be using the data itself
1436,1510804697.00011,Myong,"So the idea is basically upload the data to a frontend (I'll probably use flask) and geolocate them using a database we've been given.; the frontend is supposed to feature an interactive map; Geolocating victims of DDoS attacks that is.; But for now, the file is so large I'm not sure how long it should actually take to go through the whole 8GB file...; So it takes about 1 minute 54 seconds to process 15 minutes worth of packets"
1436,1510805087.000061,Marcie,off the top of my head i'd probably go for PostGresQL; + postgis
1436,1510805155.000207,Myong,I'm just trying to figure out what the tables should look like
1436,1510805564.000102,Marcie,i usually try and put together a few user stories to try and map out my data tables
1436,1510806771.00012,Myong,"<@Marcie> About to put together an example on paper and draw out what might be the best option.; <@Marcie> Just drew this up. I have no clue if this is valid or a good diagram. But it gathers all the information I need; My only concern is how detailed these things have to be. If all they need to be are IPs that map to locations and like 3 other columns of integers then it will be easy cause I can make a single table; So the basic structure that I currently have in python is this.; Actually, realizing the circular reference is gonna be horrible. Scratch that table; Alternatively I could simply remove the Attack Time Frame since I can query the DDoS Victims table for timeframes between a specific time; Guess this problem is a bit more difficult than I thought as far as what I know is concerned."

1441,1510847231.000708,Sade,hmmmm really?  that seems kind of odd for it to live “outside” of the else block it describes; i guess the extra line break does group it along with it though

1441,1510850023.000137,Donella,"I'm running into issues with Pandas when combining `.cut()` and `.count_value()` due to bins not actually being present as values in the data. 
The snippet below shows a workable example. Basically what I'm trying to get is a simple bar plot:

  | |         |
|-----|-----|-----|
  A I   A I   A I
  0-10 10-20 20-30
```
The OS distributions are shown within percentage bins, and bins should be shown even if there's no data for them.
In the snippet I've used `pd.cut()` on the percentage data to get a nice categorical column. I group this data using `groupby` and then I want to get the counts for each OS using `value_counts()`. This is where the code crashes, seemingly because (in the sample data) only 4 out of 21 bins are actually present.
The results based on the rounded up data do show that in theory it does what I need it to.
Any way I can easily get around that crash?"

At my personal laptop, I tinker configurations here and there and I imagine that I had changed something that I shouldn't have from the openssl or ca-certificates packages

1454,1510928305.000269,Jaquelyn,"<@Virgen> i think it really depends what you're looking for. django is probably going to be easier to start out with, unless you've already got pretty strong python skills and web development experience with (insert large established framework here). i'd say there's more extensions, more tutorials, a livelier community around django. it's also got some established conventions for how things are done (more or less) and that can help a lot if you've got a team. all that said, flask is great - it lets you build exactly what you want without all the extra batteries you might not need. (but as your project gets bigger, i think you'll discover that actually hey a lot of those things are going to be needed, and you'll end up needing to research and integrate a solution in flask). but, you spend a month building up a flask app vs a django app, and while you'd probably get further on the django app, you're also going to have a much deeper understanding of how flask works compared to the ""magic"" of django"

1455,1510935060.000663,Arica,"Hi All! :wave: 
I have what I believe should be an easy task, but am having a rather difficult time understanding. It is regarding dependencies installed via `pip`.
I installed tensorflow a while back (version 1.0.0), but now want to upgrade to `1.1.0`. I have this code snippet (`tf_version.py`) that prints the current version of tensorflow:
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
When I run `python tf_version.py` in the terminal I get `1.0.0`. However, when I run `pip uninstall tensorflow` I get:
```
Cannot uninstall requirement tensorflow, not installed
```
Where could this dependency be hiding?"
1455,1510935808.000754,Fabiola,"Hi <@Arica>, which OS are you on?"
1455,1510935855.000473,Arica,macOS 10.13.1
1455,1510935900.00011,Fabiola,"I only know *bash, but let's try this."
1455,1510935908.000493,Junita,do you need authentication?
1455,1510935916.000326,Fabiola,What happens when you type `which pip` and `which python` into your shell?
1455,1510935918.000247,Junita,do you need to paginate the search results?
1455,1510935934.000546,Arica,`/usr/local/bin/pip`
1455,1510935945.000401,Virgen,paginate... not sure...

1455,1510935964.000537,Fabiola,"Ok, thought that might be the case ^^"
1455,1510935989.000175,Junita,if it’s just a simple query and display I’d actually say Flask would probably be quicker to get you up and running.
1455,1510936020.000325,Fabiola,"I'm not an expert, but it looks like you `pip` and `python` are in different distributions, and that's causing the issue"
1455,1510936024.000043,Junita,"it’s the bells and whistles like auth, pagination, database models, etc where Django can really help you by guiding you in what to do"
1455,1510936031.000583,Fabiola,Because of a conflict in paths
1455,1510936033.000226,Arica,well that's farther than I got!; Thanks <@Fabiola>!
1455,1510936046.000376,Fabiola,I surprised that it picks up one and not the other
1455,1510936050.000167,Junita,in the end though I honestly don’t think you can go wrong either way
1455,1510936056.000761,Fabiola,Do you have a file called .bashrc in your home directory?
1455,1510936063.000021,Arica,yeah
1455,1510936072.000283,Fabiola,does it have a line in it added by anaconda?
1455,1510936079.000184,Junita,"If you have any local resources, like friends or coworkers who have experience in either one, that’d be a good way to prioritize which to choose"
1455,1510936080.000642,Virgen,"for pagination, I think I would really only need the main page and limit the number of results."
1455,1510936089.000163,Fabiola,"something like `export PATH=""/home/ogaday/miniconda3/bin:$PATH""`"
1455,1510936104.00081,Arica,"no it doesn't; hmm, i may have accidentally removed it; if it was supposed to be there"
1455,1510936136.000701,Fabiola,Interesting ^^ I think it's an option to put it there automatically when installing anaconda
1455,1510936173.000247,Virgen,"hmm... I'm torn. I think I might go with django. I dont have any local resources for assistance. My understanding is that django has the more significant web community.; and, if this is successful, I may start looking for other tasks that I can simplify by building a simple webapp, when that time comes, if I need some of those features you talked about in django, I would rather build on existing knowledge than learn django after having figured out flask..."
1455,1510936264.000726,Fabiola,"Do you want to do a bit of deeper troubleshooting, or do you just want to get on with other stuff right now?"
1455,1510936265.000555,Junita,"it might, although I’m not sure the difference would be significant enough to matter.; yeah that sounds like a good plan; django definitely has a little more of a learning curve than flask, but it’ll shine when you get into intermediate level stuff"
1455,1510936669.000328,Virgen,thank you for the info! I do appreciate it!
1455,1510936710.000337,Fabiola,"Essentially: you want to be installing stuff using `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip` instead of `/usr/local/bin/pip`, because the different `pip`s will install the packages to different places. If you try `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip uninstall tensorflow` it should work. And in future you want to be using the anaconda pip, not your system pip, because you're using the python interpreter installed by anaconda, which will look for packages installed in the place the anaconda `pip` uses, which if why you could run that file without trouble before"
1455,1510936752.00045,Junita,np
1455,1510936890.000349,Fabiola,"In the future, rather than always writing `/Users/danilo.../pip` when using `pip` you can modify your `PATH` environment variable so that it points at `anaconda/bin` before `usr/lcoal/bin`; Anther consideration for the future is that when doing projects you can create virtual environments, either using `conda` (<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html>) or virtual envs (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>). That way, each project will have it's own packages and dependencies. So you can use `tensorflow 1.0.0` for one project, and `tensorflow 1.2.0` for another. That way, code you wrote a year ago will still run. It takes a little bit more thought to manage, but it's worth it, in my experience; I prefer `conda`, because it's better for things like `scipy`, `numpy`, etc.

Oh, and I think to fix your `PATH` variable you could put a line like `export PATH=""Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin:$PATH""` in your `.bashrc` but I'm not sure. You can try and delete the line later if it doesn't work!; To see what your `PATH` currently looks like, I think you can write `echo $PATH` in your shell"

I’m working on my very first data science project and had some questions regarding the amount of data that I use… I have two large datasets from the US dept of Justice and Kaggle, both with info about student earnings post-graduation from every major university in the US. Unfortunately, the metrics in one data set is not the same metric used as the Kaggle data set (I wanted to use the same time metric’s).. How should I go about this issue? Should I work on converting one data set metric to the same metric that i’m using..? Or should I only use the data that fits the time metric?

I have: 1 server with few different python applications and I need to set up jobs in airflow for all of them
questions:
1. what would be the best solution - use `airflow` instance per project(requirements.txt for a project) have 1 separate instance and configuration for jobs from all project in this repo
2. If 1 instance per project - there is a problem, that some of of tasks(from different projects - Task1 from project A, taks 4 from project C) resource consuming so there is an idea to group them and run only after each other - then you can’t do it when you have instance per project
3. if 1 separate instance for all projects - you have dependency with all commands paths for projects(`/var/projectA/run.sh`, `/var/projectB/run-123.sh`) and deploy changes becomes a bit tricky
sorry for these nubes questions, `airflow` smth new for me :slightly_smiling_face:"

1509,1511641647.00004,Zelma,"hey guys; So i am new to python, I am on linux and i seem to have python (v2.7) and python3 preinstalled; when i open my vscode IDE it tries to install a bunch of things like my linter (which will run the commands against the /usr/bin/python binary and not the v3 one); Am i supposed to change the symlink on my install if i want to use python3?; Or do i have to upgrade the default version? Or what do i do?"
1509,1511641902.000043,Ciera,before installing anything you should check out virtualenv; you don't want to install stuff on your system python as it's widely used by other tools
1509,1511642124.000017,Zelma,I see.. so it isolates it for your project; basically like NPM / Composer so you have your dependencies for your project only?
1509,1511642171.000042,Ciera,yeah exactly; depending on your system you might also want to compile the latest python `3.6.3` so you can learn with the newest; there are multiple tools that can help you with that. I would recommend `pyenv` or `pythonz`
1509,1511642356.000059,Zelma,"so wait.. i dont even know what all those things are yet.. i want to run a python script and now i hear about virtualenv, pip, pyenv, pythonz; pythonz is like nvm?"
1509,1511642557.000076,Ciera,If you just want to run a python script you can easily run it with your system python. Then if you need to install dependencies you should use a virtualenv that split dependencies per project and you use pip to install the modules you need; What you can also do is install other version of python if you want to develop on them. Theses version should be installed alongside your system python because replacing it could cause some bugs for your system
1509,1511642683.000043,Zelma,I see.. but what do i point to in my python scripts? #!/usr/bin/env python ?
1509,1511642710.000068,Ciera,If you are on a recent linux your python3 version should be at least `3.5.x`. There is now python `3.6.x` but it doesn't changes a lot of things especially if you are a beginner; I believe `#!/usr/bin/env python` is correct but I usually don't put a shebang so I'm not sure
1509,1511642891.000045,Zelma,Well if i want to use v3 for it (any 3.* version should be compatible with any v3 version if python follows semver) So would i target python3?
1509,1511643009.000008,Ciera,if your script only run on python3 yes; usually python without version point to python2
1509,1511643117.000029,Zelma,I see..; So what is pyvenv? the pythonz docs point to it if python &gt;= 3.3; I want to use the latest version of python.. so definitely &gt;= 3.3
1509,1511643236.000081,Ciera,If you build on python3 I personally recommend aiming compatibility for python3.5 and up; but then it can depends on what you are doing
1509,1511643294.000058,Zelma,Why does it matter if i use 3.4 or 3.5 or 3.6? Shouldn't they all work with python3
1509,1511643341.000051,Ciera,they are all forward compatible but 3.5 and 3.6 brings new features that aren't supported on older version
1509,1511643448.00003,Zelma,that sounds like it is not  forward compatible at all if they aren't supported; That they have new features should be obvious (hence the version bump)
1509,1511643629.000041,Ciera,well a new feature in 3.5 is not supported in 3.4
1509,1511643925.000065,Zelma,Yeah of course; so having in mind that i want to use python &gt;= 3.3; And i already have installed pythonz and my pthon 3.6.2 is ready to go; whats the next step for me here? Do i install virtualenv or venv (Which seems to be the new thing since python 3.3?)
1509,1511644078.000068,Ciera,you can create a virtualenv with `/path/to/python -m venv path/to/env`; and then activate it with `. path/to/env/bin/activate`
1509,1511644157.000037,Zelma,"""/path/to/env"" is my directory? like a npm project directory?; and the path/to/python is just any python version? Or do i have to use the pythonz binary path)"
1509,1511644230.000033,Ciera,paht to env is the path to the env direcory. So usually your/project/.env; and you need to use the python executable of the version you want your env to be in
1509,1511644323.000052,Zelma,so in my case pythonz locate 3.6.2
1509,1511644343.000039,Ciera,yep
1509,1511644522.000072,Zelma,So i did this and it created a pyenv.cfg file and a bunch of folders; So following the docs from <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>; i activated the environment with source ./bin/activate; and now executing the script which was targeting python now outputs v3.6.2; so that seems like a good start
1509,1511644781.000005,Ciera,now you can `pip install stuff` safely without risking to mess your system python :thumbsup:
1509,1511644813.000033,Zelma,And if i change projects i pretty much do the same there but then activate the other project and install stuff there via pip
1509,1511644869.000105,Ciera,yes
1509,1511644897.000055,Zelma,So why did you point me to virtualenv in the beginning? Did you assume i was using a python version below 3.3? or is there some additional benefit of using it?
1509,1511644964.000045,Ciera,"I'm just used to say virtualenv. They are all the same things, it's just the way to create them that changed"
1509,1511645143.00006,Zelma,"ahh i see..; i am getting a bunch of errors trying to pip install things; first of all i installed setuptools using sudo pip install setuptools; and it gives me ""Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"""
1509,1511645359.000051,Ciera,you shouldn't need to `sudo`
1509,1511645360.000061,Zelma,which does not really sound like it is inside the virtual env?; that gave me a permission error earlier without sudo
1509,1511645377.000064,Ciera,and are you sure your env is activated ?
1509,1511645396.000083,Zelma,"it says ""(python_test) name@name-pc ~python_test $; so it sounds like it is correct; but the fact that it points to 2.7 doesn't sound right, does it"
1509,1511645437.000028,Ciera,can you do `which pip` ?; and `python --version`
1509,1511645463.000007,Zelma,but return the correct thing; python_test/bin/pip and v3.6.2

1509,1511645526.00002,Ciera,can you do `pip install requests` and copy the error here if you got one :slightly_smiling_face:
1509,1511645533.000005,Zelma,"when i run  pip install pyside Command ""python setup.py egg_info"" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-z7ojhvbi/pyside/; It downloaded and installed everything successful; but running pip install pyside still gives me the same error"
1509,1511645628.000063,Ciera,that might be a problem with pyside then; I'm not really familliar with it :confused:

1509,1511645683.000051,Ciera,can you do `pip install -U pip setuptools`; it will update pip and setuptools and then retry

1517,1511735227.000053,Staci,"Question; I'm helping someone out with a homework problem, and their teacher/textbook has them naming class attributes with double underscores. What is the purpose of this?

for example we have a class Nation:
```
class Nation:
    def __init__(self, name, continent, population):
        self.__name = name
        self.__continent = continent
        self.__population = population
```; What does the double underscore do here? I know it does something because when I create an instance, I can't access the attributes with .__name; I have to access with ._Nation__name; What is the purpose of this?"
1517,1511735606.000029,Corrinne,"__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).

__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: ""magic"" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__,  __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.; Not sure if this helps; Naming an attribute in your class self._var1 indicates to the user of the class that the attribute should only be accessed by the class's internals (or perhaps those of a subclass) and that they need not directly access it and probably shouldn't modify it. You should use leading underscores in the same places that you would use a private or protected field in Java or C#, but be aware that the language doesn't actually enforce non-access - instead you trust your class's user to not do anything stupid, and leave them the option of accessing (or modifying) your class's private field if they're really, really sure that they know what they're doing and it makes sense.; I wondered the same thing a while ago. Quite a good answer here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name>"
1517,1511735765.000097,Staci,"Based on the assignment, and the textbook, it looks to me like the class is heavily influenced by Java/C# principles that aren't really relevant in python; What is the purpose of ""Name Mangling""?; Ah, nevermind. I think I see it here in pep8; To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.

Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named __a, it cannot be accessed by Foo.__a. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling Foo._Foo__a.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.; avoiding name clashes with subclasses"

1530,1511814743.000472,Ciera,it depends who is going to run the script; python you need to install it so it might be a bit more complex if random users needs to use it
1530,1511814787.000094,Mallie,"Python is not installed by default on Windows, that's one thing"
1530,1511814921.000561,Season,I wouldn’t imagine I’d get push back on installing python but I have no issues with learning powershell either.

1530,1511815034.000213,Ciera,and if you have the time to learn PowerShell might as well do it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1530,1511815324.000164,Seema,"I'm going to assert (from past experience) that it's much easier to ask the domain admin to create an account in order to authenticate with AD.  Python can connect to the LDAP directory, query, and authenticate though you're asking python to ""be"" a windows user and depending on how the AD is setup, you/domain admin might get (weird) errors about the ticket system or use of resources or other arcane stuff; and to troubleshoot you'll have to dig through event viewer logs on the server to figure out why you can X but not Y; PowerShell has 20+ years (from mmc console) of getting passed the TGT (more fun Windows trivia).   You'll learn a lot trying it with Python though you may or may not want to have a new respect for Windows.

1530,1511815707.000532,Seema,It's quite mature at this point
1530,1511815879.000007,Johana,you can use python and subprocess to execute powershell scripts

1543,1511901369.000271,Lilliam,<@Sirena> thanks is there any other way to update an option menu based on what is selected in another option menu?
1543,1511901718.000459,Sirena,"hard to say without knowing more, but probably you should create some kind of empty or default menu stuff in the __init__ before you call the other functions, as it sits currently you have a circular dependence; so I don't think it's impossible to update a menu based on a menu; but you can't update a menu based on unknowable information for sure; you might be able to just move #19 down to #25 and have it work, there's a lot going on here that I'm not terribly familiar with; I don't do much GUI or DB stuff, sadly"

You can trick jinja2 into multiple inheritance through `extends`, `include` and `import` which allows you to do things like template segments for header, footer, if say it's a separation aggreement you'll have a section that waives liability of the lawyer on almost every divorce document so you can create a standard template for this.

It's still possible to have the same time zone code with two different offsets though, I think. You might have to check the lib docs"

I think a lot of those timezone fields are not super standardized so it depends what libs are underneath, and I only really have experience on the Linux side of those libs. No idea what it does in Windows/other. Might be the same, might not. If you're especially concerned about it, you might use datetime to fetch the GMT offset and then convert to time zone codes yourself. If it's not especially critical you can just leave it to the library; you may find this reference useful. It looks like CET is used for standard and daylight both, as is Europe/Amsterdam, and they are the same values for GMT offsets; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>"

1579,1512135340.00084,Ivonne,Hi guys! Can som1 help me with making a script. I am new in Python. I have one script that downloads files every 15s and put them in the zip and now I need to make another script that follows the changes of those files and if the zip folders are'nt increasing in size the notification should be sent on particular email.
1579,1512136103.000337,Ciera,Hey <@Ivonne>. I don't think anyone here will do the work for you. Maybe try to do something by yourself and if you get stuck ask for help on a specific issue.  If you are new to python we often recommend <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>
1580,1512137015.000585,Robbin,"Hey guys, so im trying to get all the duplicate part_no's that i have stores in a table, and have that in a report that can be downloaded at anytime.

```
def duplicate_components(request):
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text.csv')
    response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=""duplicate_components.csv""'
    dups = Component.objects.values('part_no').annotate(name_count=Count('id')).order_by().filter(name_count__gt=1)

    writer = csv.writer(response)
    #for components in Component.objects.filter(part_no__in=[item['part_no'] for item in dups]):
    writer.writerow(dups)
    return response
```
Now its working but the output format is not the best, i think its lists in a dict. 
```
{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u' ', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'?', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'000000000', 'name_count': 11}	{'part_no': u'0340460000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'0383560000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06127501301', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06b Renold 38 Chain', 'name_count': 3}
```

Outputs to the file like that, as a csv file so im getting `{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}` in each field. 
How would i change the out put to a normal format eg: 
```
Part_no, Count,
345345345, 4
453453434, 5```"
1580,1512137161.000902,Meg,what I’d do is look at <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>; use that to generate an excel spreadsheet; but your original question… your output is doing exactly what you’re telling it to do; because `dups` is a queryset; how do you iterate over a queryset to extract the values you need to some intermediate object?
1580,1512137265.000664,Robbin,"Yeah i know, im struggling with how i can convert it so i can use keys to print them to a csv file"
1580,1512137283.000208,Meg,"well, you’re telling it to use values"
1580,1512137326.000638,Robbin,"I have tried to use values_list, i don't know any other alternatives."
1580,1512137450.000557,Meg,"assuming you have a loop like `for dup in dups`; you’d access the property with a dot variable like `dup.part_no`, `dup.name_count`; oh, wait"
1580,1512137491.001031,Robbin,I have tried: So i have other reports that i have created
1580,1512137497.000629,Meg,its a dict set; so it’d be `dup.get('part_no')`
1580,1512137526.00002,Robbin,ahhhhh
1580,1512137538.000203,Meg,"yeah, because with that one, you’re using the queryset with the actual model objects; with `values`, its just pulling out the field and value alone, and you have to use dict notation"
1580,1512137602.000364,Robbin,"writer.writerow([dups.get('part_no'), dups.get('name_count')])"
1580,1512137631.000129,Meg,no; because `dups` is a list of dicts
1580,1512137656.000049,Robbin,thats why i need the for loop?
1580,1512137669.000218,Meg,"yes; unless there’s some way `writerow` will take in a dict; hmm, you can use dictwriter instead; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/8331638/214892>"
1580,1512137744.000623,Winnie,help I have 2 counters containing objects but when I find their difference I get an empty counter back
1580,1512138860.000209,Suellen,<@Winnie> can you show the code snippet?
1580,1512139026.000958,Louvenia,Perhaps this book: <https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook>
1580,1512139165.000985,Winnie,NVM I GOT IT; <@Suellen> it was a problem of iterating an iterator twice; that's the second time I've had that bug; any tips on how to stop shooting myself in the foot like that?
1580,1512139385.000109,Suellen,don't iterate over already exhausted generators ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1580,1512139395.000459,Winnie,but I don't know that they're generators...; my functions took in an items field; but I had items as Counter.elements()
1581,1512138776.000561,Lilliam,What is the best place to learn fundamentals of computer science and programming I feel like i am missing some things and want to retouch my vocabulary and fundamentals of how things work data memory etc; thanks any free ebooks out there or anything?; I plan on purchasing this though this seems good but do you know of any free material
1583,1512140935.000077,Glinda,"By counter you mean `collections.Counter` ?; Couple of problems I might not be understanding correctly. 
1. You aren't sure if you are getting an iterator or a iterable. In the first case you exhaust your iterable when you compare. The second case you can do a good check later. 

2. You are always getting an iterator and will always run into the exhausted iterator when you want to use the values. 

In the first case you can deal with this by using `isinstance(obj, type)` and the `collections` library. 
```from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator

def my_iterator(): 
    yield 1

i = my_iterator()
a = []

isinstance(i, Iterator) # True
isinstance(a, Iterator) # False```; So in the case that you actually have an iterable you don't need to worry about exhausting your iterable. This leads us to how do you deal with exhausting an iterable? Well one way is to create an iterable like a list, but this gets rid of the advantages of an iterable- the returned contents could be really large.; Here's a function that goes over another method that keeps it in an iterable, and lets you deal with not having large memory concerns. 
<http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/01/03/be-defensive-when-iterating-over-arguments/>; return True if y else False; ```def test_funct(y_val):
    return True if y_val else False
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(test_funct(None))
    print(test_funct(1))```"
1583,1512142318.000764,Lory,"That's making it longer, I know you can do a one line statement for when you have a boolean operation, I just can't remember the syntax for it"
1583,1512142381.00007,Glinda,So you want `single line if else value assignment?`; not single line None checking?; Because if you want to check if a value is none
1583,1512142482.000602,Lory,"I don't necessarily care if it is None, I just have a value that will be either True or None and I want to save it as a False or True. Which I know of the classic `y = True if x else False` but I know I've used something along the lines of `y = if x` in the past for boolean operations like that"
1583,1512142489.000913,Glinda,"`small = x if x &lt; y else y`; <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#id23>; ```def test_funct(y):
    x = True if not y else False
    print(x)
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_funct(None)
    test_funct(1)
    ```; I think what you're getting at is; I have two conditions I want to check, `y== True`, `y==False`. Now there's other conditions you could have to consider `y == anything else`; Since you know  the value ""will be either True or None and you want to map `None -&gt; True` or map `True -&gt; False` Then you only have two actual conditions.; in that case you can do this assignment: `x = True if not y else False`"
1583,1512143039.000302,Lory,Yea I mean I understand all that and that's not where my confusion is. I just thought I remember there being some super shorthand way to achieve the same goal but I think I'm mistaking it with something like `x = not y` which is possible
1583,1512143303.000983,Glinda,"Looks like you can chain ternary operators, but the only case I've seen requires 3 conditions: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2919360/8143102>; `1 if a &gt; b else -1 if a &lt; b else 0`; Now since you want things as short as possible practical advice is that in many cases you don't want one line functions that do too many things, there's the programmer you today, tomorrow a month from now and next year. And next year you're going to wonder why you didn't put this single line into a separate function. Name the function something like `def is_value_None(input_value)`; It looked like he wanted to map `True or None and I want to save it as a False or True` True =&gt; False, None =&gt; True; `y = not bool(x)`; Any suggestions on a way to reverse enumerate that is better than these options- replaced with file; `first` is better due to preserving original index, but not sure I like the `list(....)` part.; I kinda like this `third` wrapper"
1583,1512149920.000559,Suellen,no need for `list()` conversion in `first()`
1583,1512149930.00108,Ciera,"I think, if it works, `enumerate(reversed(my_list))` is better"
1583,1512149943.000596,Suellen,or that :stuck_out_tongue:
1583,1512149998.000074,Ciera,reversed is a builtin so it should be faster than consume the `enumerate` iterator; but not sure
1583,1512150093.00101,Suellen,"`TypeError: 'enumerate' object is not reversible`; yours is best, <@Ciera> :))"
1583,1512150174.000861,Ciera,yeah it's something I discovered not to long ago. You can define a `__reverse__` dunder; if not it will consume everything and then reverse it
1583,1512150202.000724,Suellen,:open_mouth:; Not sure why I wrote it in such a way; It's more logical to reverse and then enumerate; less work %)
1583,1512150701.00014,Glinda,But now the index doesn't correspond to the original index.
1584,1512146769.000352,Loris,"`y = bool(x)`, however in almost all cases just using `x` is what you want.  You usually don't want a `bool`, you want something that is ""truthy"" or ""falsey"", and x already is that."
1585,1512149882.000707,Suellen,`reversed(enumerate(my_list))`?
1586,1512152305.000815,Arla,"I am trying to write a code which involves these two lines; In this case, is the array traversed twice or once and is there a way of combining these two statements?"

    url(r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/$', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),

    url(r'^(?P&lt;question_id&gt;[0-9]+)/vote/$', views.vote, name='vote'),

    url(r'^api/v1/question/(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/detail/$',views.question_detail,name = 'question_detail.api')

1610,1512437467.000075,Meg,doubt it; you will probably have to update openssl or your python version; since 2.7.5 is _really_ old; are you on linux or mac?

1622,1512503409.00038,Season,"Hi quick question…  I want to run a python script from cron to add/modify entries to the /etc/hosts file on Ubuntu, daily.  I have never been good at reg ex and struggling this this simple code.  I admittedly googled this syntax and don’t completely understand it.

```
with open('/tmp/hoststest', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    print(hosts_data)
    new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)',r'\1' + new_hosts_data + r'\3',hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)
    print(new_hosts_data)
```
Result
```
#StartStoreLocations
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
#EndStoreLocations
```
Original Contents
```
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
```
So it looks like its finding the section to replace but not replacing the start and close tags. I’ve been playing with it for an hour and cant figure it out."
1623,1512504994.000231,Sirena,have you considered dns instead?
1623,1512505053.000255,Season,":slightly_smiling_face: I knew someone would mention that. Yes I would love to use DNS but in this situation I dont have that control; this will serve my needs but for my education, I’d like to understand the regex better"
1623,1512505331.000549,Frieda,"so the pattern is `r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)'`. what does that pattern do, as you understand it, <@Season>?"
1623,1512505563.000293,Sirena,"um, I don't think new_hosts_data is defined inside the re.sub function?; this is pretty convoluted, would you be able to transmit a diff and then use `patch` to apply it to your /etc/hosts?"
1623,1512505823.000536,Season,"its there and sort of working, I jsut must have a problem with my regex because its putting the data inside the file but not replacing the starting and ending tags.  so it replaces 
```
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
```
With
```
#StartStoreLocations
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
#EndStoreLocations
```"
1623,1512505861.000103,Sirena,"it seems to me like new_hosts_data already has the tags, so you're inserting them between the literal tags in your regex; that's just a guess"
1623,1512505917.000027,Season,yes that exactly what happening.  I just cant figure out how to fix it
1623,1512505947.000034,Sirena,"```new_hosts_data = '#nhdtag\ninfo\#nhdtag'

yields:
#StartStoreLocations
#nhdtag
info
#nhdtag
#EndStoreLocations```; you'll fix it with; `new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; if you want to keep the new_hosts_data tags; if you want to keep the literals but throw away the new_hosts_data tags, then I'd suggest preprocessing new_hosts_data to drop those lines"
1623,1512506073.000125,Frieda,does `#StartStoreLocations` or `#EndStoreLocations` ever change?
1623,1512506135.000051,Season,<@Frieda> no; <@Shavonda> that worked except it wiped out the rest of the file with the new data
1623,1512506194.000074,Sirena,? you said the original file only had 3 lines; at least in your example
1623,1512506238.000276,Season,I simplified it. there are other entries in my hosts file.  I want to update those.
1623,1512506263.000287,Frieda,"if they never change, make them non-matching groups and only replace the parts in between; at it is now, it looks like you're always copying them back in"
1623,1512506292.000151,Season,"thats why I was placing the entries between those tags.  here is my current code with your tweaks

```
with open('/etc/hosts', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    if '#StartStoreLocations' in open('/etc/hosts').read():
        new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)
    else:
        new_hosts_file = hosts_data + new_hosts_data
    
with open('/etc/hosts', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(new_hosts_file)
```; <@Frieda> agreed,  thats what I want to do but I am literally brain dead when it comes to regex.  I cant figure out the syntax, which is why I posted here."
1623,1512506811.000371,Sirena,"if new_hosts_data has the tags, just do:
`new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; I personally don't really like that `.*?` because it's slippery, so I might change it to `new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations\s*(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; but if you like it, it's sorta personal preference"
1623,1512506984.00026,Season,I like what works at this point :slightly_smiling_face:  trying to wrap my head around it still
1623,1512507069.000053,Sirena,"can even drop the perens around `(.*)` since you're not using the backrefs any more, but I think they make it easier to read"
1623,1512507106.000681,Season,<@Shavonda> works PERFECTLY  thanks!  Now I need to make sure I understand it.  Ive been coding off and on for 20 years and regex has always made my head hurt
1623,1512507138.000104,Sirena,"yeah, I wrote a decent bit of perl for like 4 years, but there's a reason people sometimes call regexes a ""write only language""; if you write some guru stuff and don't come back to it for 6 months, you might have no idea what you did"
1623,1512507293.00015,Season,I don’t use reg much so whenever I looks at it my eyes are like wtf am I looking at.  I’ll go watch a lynda video or something sometime soon
1623,1512507942.000765,Sirena,"yah, I sorta recommend against it. I don't know where your input comes from or anything, but as a cron job you might just consider transmitting diffs around and apply them using `patch`; it's a pretty well established and understood format with tools built around it; in your case, your format is pretty straightforward, and hosts files already have a format that generally will avoid any weird regex problems, so it probably doesn't matter"
1623,1512508377.000174,Vita,"Anyone have an example (for the front end mainly) of a way to organize a bunch of different reports? I want to make them easier to find, but I am not sure what I should use for it; Also, I am not opposed to solutions that need backend work, but the primary goal is to make it easy for end users to use"
1624,1512509954.000451,Laine,did you get this resolved?; At work I have to add --trusted-host=<http://pypi.python.org|pypi.python.org> to every PIP command to get it to work. It seems to try to insert my companies SSL certificate into the mix.; I literally just figured this out so I thought I'd pass it along <@Myong>
1624,1512510099.000092,Myong,"Yeah, I've been using that work around, but it's just not the best option simply because it leaves room for a man in the middle attack; now I don't think that will happen but it's always possible; And you can follow the link to make it so you dont have to specify it every time you do `pip install ...`; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45337029/pip-conf-not-paying-attention-to-trusted-host>"

1626,1512518319.000163,Staci,"Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.

I'm trying to identify an item based on the name given in an a Description. There are about 25-30 possible items and each possible item has anywhere from 2-20 possible spelling/spacing/wordorder/special characters combinations in the description. For example something like this:

```
ICE_WATER = [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield"", ]
```

There are overlaps in the description names with other items, so I don't think using any ""distance"" or other search algo will get me accurate results. Hence why I've resorted to exact name matching. (If you disagree maybe I could give you some more examples and I could look into it more.)

originally, I put these all the possible names in one large dictionary with the function to call as the value. I didn't really like how long and ugly the list was and difficult to maintain (as I find new possible items or terms are added) so I'm wondering how ugly/slow using a long list of `if/elif desc in ITEM_LIST` might affect my program (as long as it doesn't add more than a second I think I'll deal with it) or if there is another alternate (possibly even obvious) method I can use to identify these items (each with different calculations that need to be performed). And route them to the appropriate (now) methods."
1626,1512518340.000152,Arlene,"You mean, curl request get response; than in other variable do the jq stuff?"
1626,1512518493.000072,Staci,"I'll probably clean it up to where I'm only assigning 2 or 3 attributes per item rather than a separate method for each, but I still need a better way to identify them."
1626,1512518516.00008,Arlene,it be nice if .py had switch statement; i think it make this easier; but maybe you can write your own switch
1626,1512518546.000068,Staci,You can make a switch with a dictionary; That's essentially what I had before
1626,1512518565.000273,Marcie,"<@Arlene> from testing this might do it
```ID=""$(curl -X GET $PLATFORM_URL/foo \
                     -H ""x-cookie: token=$TOKEN"" \
                    | jq "".[] | .[] | select(.name==\""$NAME\"") | .id"")""```; as this works:
```NAME=foobar
echo ""$(cat ./test.json | jq "".[] | select(.name==\""${NAME}\"")"" )""```"
1626,1512518600.000122,Staci,I guess I could put all of the descriptions in a table with their appropriate attributes and query the table
1626,1512518664.00021,Arlene,<@Marcie> :boom: that works; Oh man I am tired today.; lol; <@Marcie> Thanks for taking the time sir!
1626,1512518707.000135,Marcie,"<@Staci> you could have descriptions and associated calls in a dict; something like
```checks = {
    'ice_water': [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield""]

1626,1512519288.000099,Staci,"Yea, that is my plan, I just need a way of identifying the items so I can assign the appropriate attributes; I think I may have talked myself into just creating a table, that way it won't require a code change if/when I need to add items in the future; or descriptions rather; but I appreciate your feedback <@Marcie> I like that pretty well"

1636,1512574263.000076,Ivonne,Hey guys! Can someone help me. I am new at Python and I am stuck on this script for 2 days. I have script (<https://gist.github.com/2filip3/bd8d0f26491572c1cce355e9f7e0d366>)that monitors folder and notifies me when files are changed. I want to notify me on email but I don't want my email to get spammed because the file changes every 5 sec. So can som1 tell me what change to make in script so I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED so I would know my script has stopped. Thank you!; It supposed to be running on server 2.7 Python
1636,1512574396.000579,Winnie,"I don't understand; <@Ivonne> 
You
&gt; notifies me when files are changed
but also
&gt;  I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED; can you clarify?"
1636,1512574628.000824,Ivonne,"Yeah sure. Script I am running is monitoring my folder. In that folder i have files tar.gz that are being updated every 5 sec. In my script I get notifications about every change that happens in specified folder. Now, because I wont to get those notifications on email, I need to rewrite script so it doesn't notify on every change because my email would be spammed. I need to modify it in the way that notifies me ONLY when files in specified folder are not being changed/updated or created so I would know when my other script(that is making those files to be updated) has stopped working."
1636,1512574708.000588,Sirena,are these like rolling log files?; do you maybe only want a notification when a new file gets created?
1636,1512574757.000394,Scot,Sounds like he just wants to be notified when his script crashes
1636,1512574957.000589,Sirena,Could just put an atexit handler on the script
1636,1512574976.000202,Scot,What happens if the host crashes?; Not saying it's relevant in this case
1636,1512574995.00066,Sirena,then the script-monitoring script probably went with it; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; need a little more specifics if we're going to go down this particular rabbit hole
1636,1512575068.000443,Ciera,I think it might be easier to use a process manager to monitor the first script; than check if files are being created/modified
1636,1512575113.000354,Sirena,depends on how the first script typically stops working
1636,1512575730.000685,Ivonne,"I need to monitor files, not script guys.; Script can be runing but the server that are downloading files from can be busy or at full capacity so my files wouldn't get updated and changeed; I just need to modify script which i've put above in the link so it can notifies me when the files are NOT updated"
1636,1512575854.000152,Meg,"sounds like you should define the files you want to be notified of updates with a unique prefix or suffix; and your script will check all modified files for that; if it matches, send an email"
1636,1512576017.00063,Ivonne,"I am monitoring whole folder, and i can get notifications on every change. Now I just need tomake little change to notifies me when the files are not changing but I don't know how to do that"
1636,1512576049.000186,Meg,use an interval
1636,1512576055.000127,Sirena,are you certain there will not be any files there which are _normally_ not changing?
1636,1512576060.000527,Meg,check every 30 seconds or so for changes
1636,1512576081.000003,Sirena,"yah, just stat the files and check for update times more than X seconds old; ```for file in file_list:
  if (os.path.getmtime(file) - time.time()) &gt; 30:
    print 'it has been more than 30 seconds since {} was updated'.format(file)```; something like that"
1636,1512576505.000675,Ivonne,Well I think this is helpfull but before this I would need to make a function that states whenever the file is created it should be added in the file_list so I can iterate within it. Right?; I was more looking to find some simple solution to modify watchdog; script above
1636,1512577114.000179,Sirena,"I don't know how many file notification events you were getting before, or how long you want to wait between checking for activity, but this is probably more efficient than the event based system; the problem with the watchdog is that any event you get will always be the brand new, so you won't really be able to use it to check how 'stale' a file is unless you add some pretty wacky logic; you _could_ use the watchdog to build up your file list and add new files to the list any time you catch a file creation event"
1636,1512577654.000082,Johana,you could also use something else that is built for watching files. you may be able to configure syncthing’s inotify to watch the folder and hit the syncthing rest api. <https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/events.html>

1652,1512666312.000315,Seema,"<@Glinda> you can suppress individual types of error by pressing alt+enter in PyCharm and choosing ""Ignore errors like this""; hmmm, I don't know if it differentiates on comments, do you? had never really thought/tried"
1652,1512666342.00021,Glinda,That's usually an issue I want to keep.
1652,1512666377.000191,Seema,"agreed, I wonder if there's a way to get more granular, /wonder; as in that's about as far I'm willing to go even though I probably have run across that exact thing; <http://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration>"

The check E133 is mutually exclusive with check E123. Use switch --hang-closing to report E133 instead of E123.

(^) These checks can be disabled at the line level using the # noqa special comment. This possibility should be reserved for special cases.

1652,1512666793.000358,Cordie,I need to find certain identifiers(datetime related keywords) in JQL (jira query language) and possibly remove them without breaking syntax. How do I go about parsing this JQL? Is there a well known tool or a better approach?

1652,1512667968.000262,Jeffery,@leo where are datetime saved? Changelog?
1652,1512667983.000111,Cordie,no for example
1652,1512668024.000068,Jeffery,It depends. In my Opinion you can‘t find all via jql
1652,1512668033.00014,Cordie,jql=“label=‘string’ AND blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’; i want to remove “blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’”; but it is not as simple as using just a regex; i think the link you provided is more to do with working with jira’s api; my problem is more on parsing a language…
1652,1512668563.000088,Jeffery,"I see. I can‘t really help you.
But just of curiosity - what is the use case?

Who wants to do this change? And through which interface?"
1652,1512668859.000235,Glinda,<@Cordie> are these values strings or datetimes?
1652,1512668925.000335,Cordie,<@Jeffery> it’s just an app I am building. Jira has a kanban board and i am importing the jql that populates the board; <@Glinda> well i need to cover all hahaha
1653,1512671199.00039,Patty,I don’t really see the value of letting you know there are unused params when it can simplify functions or signal you’re doing something off ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; why would you be writing functions with unused params anyway?
1653,1512671743.000258,Myong,"Yeah, I agree"
1653,1512671997.000185,Cecille,Anyone here use jupyter notebooks  &amp; anaconda to manage their environments? I’ve managed to create and manage my packages using the enviornments from anaconda but I can’t seem to get jupyter notebooks to read from the right enviornment too
1653,1512672022.00027,Glinda,"joe, it's something with `websocket`; <@Rheba>"
1653,1512672029.000571,Cecille,I’ve legit been stuck for 2 days now on this issue :cry:
1653,1512672141.00046,Glinda,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37085665/in-which-conda-environment-is-jupyter-executing>; I'm a little out of practice with jupyter/ conda but me switching away from those two was partly due to issues with virtual environments.
1653,1512672228.000587,Patty,<@Glinda> if it’s `on_open` then you just do `ws.on_open = on_open` and drop the `ws` argument since it’s not used. it’s not required for websockets
1653,1512672240.000763,Cecille,Dude it fucking blows <@Glinda> but every data scientist I run into uses it :disappointed:
1653,1512672280.000129,Glinda,So just drop ws?
1653,1512672283.000344,Patty,yep; same with in `on_close`
1653,1512672293.000343,Glinda,"Hmm, must have been a python 2 thing; Bunch of what I was doing was ported from python 2 :confused:; Aite thank you."
1653,1512672358.000408,Patty,"if any argument _must_ be there and isn’t used, naming it `_` is also a preferred method"
1653,1512672402.000097,Glinda,"<@Cecille> the problem from transitioning from anaconda to pip is that you're going to run into issues with numpy/ pandas.; conda is great for installing those packages.; And it's really not difficult for someone who has experience with python to do it, but dealing with the binaries _while_ learning python and wanting todo data science is probably the biggest reason I see people pushc onda.; If you have a student id, you can get pycharm pro for free and they are working their darndest to steal that data science money from spyder/ conda.; Give me a second, I want to see if the new changes make it easy to deal with numpy/ pandas in a windows"
1653,1512672799.000566,Patty,"btw <@Glinda> you’re right, the `ws` lib is going to provide that argument by default, so `_` may be better if you aren’t using it"
1653,1512672837.000593,Glinda,"Thanks man,  the main reason for asking isn't finding a working solution but best practice.; It's probably better to treat the socket as a class.; <@Cecille> So I opened a new pycharm project. Typed `ctrl +alt+ s` and created a new virtual environment and applied to this project. Then I  created a folder with these imports. ```import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt```; It told me package wasn't installed in virtual environment. So I clicked on them pressed alt enter; ```11:51 AM	Packages installed successfully: Installed packages: 'numpy'

11:54 AM	Packages installed successfully: Installed packages: 'matplotlib'

11:54 AM	Packages installed successfully: Installed packages: 'pandas'```; Addded this to my script ``` s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])
print(s)```; ```0    1.0
1    3.0

1654,1512672880.000331,Patty,"yeah it made me realize that it may be forcing that positional arg in, feels like it should be a kwarg but hey i didnt implement it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1654,1512673881.000464,Myong,"Hry guys just found a small bug; In inserting rows of data I have a small thing for inserting `None` in cells which are missing data in order to keep formatting in order for headers and what not; But my issue is that in some cases when there are two or more cells of data missing, the way I am inserting the data into excel is as such; nvm cant put the code; but, my question is, is there a way to order a list based on the order of another list?; so if I have something like `[""hello"", ""bye"", ""ok""] and [""ok"", ""bye""]`; I want the resulting list to be `[""bye"", ""ok""]`; Wait I think I got it actually; Figured it ou!; out"
1654,1512674561.000332,Glinda,nice job; Do you use windows 64 python 3?
1655,1512675714.000282,Myong,"Uh oh, another issue :confused:"
1655,1512675755.000429,Glinda,?; Maybe take a step back and explain the problem
1655,1512675914.000221,Myong,"So basically I have an excel file I'm generating; Now the response from the GET I make to this API send me XML with a bunch of nodes that have child nodes; I grab the text from the child nodes in the order which it appears; But in some cases the data doesnt contain every node which the header contains; so say the header covers 38 columns cause it can contain 38 different pieces of data; Sometimes I only get 35 from any given node; so I'm missing data; But I wanna insert it under the correct header; so I have a list of headers and the headers are the ""id"" nodes which are always included in the response; I also store each different main node as a dictionary, and place the dictionary in a list"
1655,1512676063.000284,Glinda,Can you show an example of the response?
1655,1512676084.000101,Myong,I can not actually
1655,1512676085.000401,Glinda,"Even just the header list with id, and another row list of id."
1655,1512676107.000012,Myong,I cant do snippets on this computer; I would just post my code if i could
1655,1512676127.000179,Glinda,snippets?; Do you not have `` key?; So since you say order of nodes matter you get the header data first right? So can you get the key from each header item and use it later to match the column from the rows of data?
1655,1512676409.000605,Myong,Yeah basically I have all possible headers and theyre in the proper order; I put the masterlist of headers and also the current headers for the current set in a `set()`; then I take the difference of one set minus the others
1655,1512676465.000179,Glinda,Any chance you tried to use a dictionary?
1655,1512676467.000221,Myong,"to get the headers which arent in the data set; I am using a dictionary, yes; When I first filter the data; But I still have to check if the key exists in the data and if it does not I dont add a key to it for that header; debugging right now i have one id i know is messing up; I think I know actually what is happening"
1655,1512676591.000069,Glinda,"Without seeing your data and what you want to happen, or code. It's pretty hard for me to help more."
1655,1512676597.000207,Myong,Yeah I know; But I think I know the issue; if there are like 3 keys
1655,1512676621.000334,Glinda,Explain why you are using `set()` to filter?
1655,1512676638.000331,Myong,with set you can use `set1 - set2`; so like
1655,1512676651.000685,Glinda,set doesn't preserve order
1655,1512676683.000137,Myong,"I reorder it; with filter; `filter()` based on index of headers; but the issue is this; just realize; when inserting into a list with different size than the main header list so like inserting into a size 35 list based on indexes of size 38 list; So if I have `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` as a main list"
1655,1512676847.000537,Glinda,"Okay so if you wishto preserve order and subtract items from list_2 from list_1 this is one way you can do it:
```list_1 = []
list_2 = []


list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
        ```; If you wish to add a space to the list when you remove: ```list_1 = []
list_2 = []

list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
    else:
        list_removed.append(None)```"
1655,1512677008.000104,Myong,It seems mostly to be an issue when two missing cells are next to each other towards the end of the list; and there is also a missing cell towards the beginning
1655,1512677024.000095,Glinda,"This will also work: `map(lambda x:x if not x in list_2 else None, list_1)`; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(lambda x:x if not x in b else None, a))
[None, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, None, None]```; Actually that works. forgot the not"
1655,1512677813.000146,Harlan,"<@Myong> So you're receiving XML, and ultimately you want to build a spreadsheet with it? I'm assuming you're generating a csv file that you're opening in excel, is that right?"
1655,1512677844.000148,Myong,"Yes, I can do pretty much everything but there is an issue with formatting it correctly"
1655,1512677851.000653,Harlan,It seems like you're manually generating the csv yourself.
1655,1512677870.000348,Myong,It's pretty complicated to explain you can read back but for now im just debugging it
1655,1512677909.000123,Harlan,"Have you tried <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter>; If you can get the XML into a dict, you can throw each one into a DictWriter object and it will take care of everything for you."
1655,1512678128.000296,Myong,I got it; I think it actually worked the whole time and I looked at the wrong file :upside_down_face:; Okay now I found the issue; It's in deciding what order to insert the items
1656,1512677941.000104,Harlan,you can even specify a restval to fill in gaps where you don't have a value for the field.
1657,1512680742.000088,Cecille,<@Glinda> got it!
1657,1512680840.000268,Glinda,What did you did up doing?
1657,1512680974.000635,Cecille,"Found a stackoverflow which pointed to a conda package called ``` nb_conda``` that you need to install; Which is also in the docs butttt they don’t mention that you need to install nb_conda  on the machine and the env; or maybe im just a scrub, who knows. But it works!"
1658,1512688532.000028,Sabra,I can’t find the function definition for settimeout in <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/socket.py>; where is settimeout defined?

1659,1512692837.000042,Bette,"Guys in python lists there is a method called insert ,can someone clarify can it insert or single element or multiple elements in to the list ?"
1659,1512693270.000095,Patty,"`list.extend()` can take an iterable and add all of that to the list, <@Bette>; <https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists>"
1659,1512693546.000299,Marcie,"an extend with an index is a bit trickier to do but also possible; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; base_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

1660,1512698213.000108,Toby,So im not sure if im doing it wrong or just not understanding but how do you make a server using asyncio? I dont get how you write the web handlers
1660,1512698554.000137,Johana,i also think requests now supports asyncio.; let me find a link.
1660,1512698590.000045,Toby,"Like in node and express you use app.get/app.post then the url after the server url, isnt there a sinple way to do this in python?"
1660,1512698994.000131,Patty,I find <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be the most express-esque python server
1660,1512699077.000153,Toby,"Well their home page is nice haha, looks very node/express-y"
1660,1512699168.000206,Patty,<@Tangela> when you use the `with cursor` context manager it closes the cursor after the code block; so you need to move all `cursor.execute()` statements to be within that context manager
1660,1512699460.000086,Winnifred,<@Patty> :taco:; (you beat me to the answer); :stuck_out_tongue:
1660,1512699511.000089,Toby,"<@Patty> any help on running flask? Haha
Their example on how to run it doesnt work"
1660,1512699557.000057,Patty,"sure I can help, let’s take it to <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be in the right channel"
1661,1512698536.000131,Johana,you would need to use the equivalent of something like requests which is aiohttp.
1661,1512699477.000176,Patty,thanks <@Winnifred> :slightly_smiling_face:
1662,1512699423.000073,Tangela,Thanks @joe worked perfectly
1663,1512703479.000089,Glinda,What exceptions are you worried about?
1663,1512703689.000059,Tangela,string too long and invalid chars...
1663,1512704196.000041,Glinda,"You kind of have a lot of things happening in this single statement.; What do you want to happen when you encounter 1. string too long, and 2. invalid chars?; Also can you paste the code here, I'd rather not retype most of it the images are helpful."
1663,1512704678.000202,Tangela,"1. When encounter a string too long I want inform the user that string is too long for store it on db, 2. The user cannot store on column emails invalid characters like /, *,&amp;, %, etc."
1663,1512705240.000011,Glinda,Are you using python &lt; 2.7
1663,1512705381.000131,Tangela,I'm using 2.7
1663,1512705383.000137,Glinda,"Okay; So I split your system into three parts.; So now you have a single location where you might have an exception `db_cursor.execute('INSERT INTO {table_name}s({table_name}) VALUES {row}'.format(table_name=table_name, row=row))`"
1663,1512705757.000047,Tangela,Thank you very much <@Glinda> I was using try..except in everywhere but with your code was reduced to 3 at least
1663,1512705780.000116,Glinda,"You know, I don't think you need the `cursor.close()`; Couple of things: 1. Don't use user=root, pw = '' set your password to something if you must use root.; 2. Try to define functions and make them reusable; Make your functions do as limited as possible; The more they do, the harder it is to debug.; A bunch more things I can suggest. But primarily, try and use python 3, and try and use a ORM like sqlalchemy.; If you're just getting into python, it's better to start off with python 3.; Anyways, feel free to ask any more questions, or more help. I'll be around here for a little while longer tonight."
1663,1512706189.00018,Tangela,"I see, from now on I will write more generic functions, I usually don't do that, later I got lost in the errors, py2.7 should be discontinued so maybe better try the most actual, there huge differences between it?"
1663,1512707561.000158,Glinda,Probably the biggest thing you'll notice is in python3 print is a function `print('string')`
1664,1512715038.000058,Blaine,"hi guys. a ver beginner question. considering this piece of code, that should sort an array of strings by their length ```def sort_by_length(arr):

1664,1512715508.000212,Gisele,The `key` should be a function.  <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions> might help you.
1664,1512715923.000217,Blaine,"ok, but len is a build_in? i will read and contemplate.; thank you <@Gisele> i've learned a lot on this. Solution is very compact ```def length(word):
    return len(word)

def sort_by_length(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=length)```; even shorter with this; ```def sort_by_length(arr):

1667,1512742960.000087,Jacki,"Hi guys. I am working with Celery, and it’s pretty cool. However, I would need a way to communicate with my application and I was thinking of nameko due to the wide range of communication protocols.; I am still in the learning mode, so I am not sure if it is a good idea or not; how do you usually provide your application with a communication layer; that can be rpc or pub/sub?"
1667,1512743443.000263,Ciera,From what I know most of the times people try to use redis to store celery result
1667,1512743614.000628,Patty,"Or rabbitmq, those are probably the 2 big backends"
1667,1512743810.000079,Jacki,"oh yes, if you need to store results  you can use a few backends service. However, my questions is about the integration of the two project.; Let say that the main business logic of the workers is made with celery.; but I need to expose a public api; and I don’t want to use flask or some other REST api; oh well, I would like to use something different than that; something more message oriented.; I am not sure if combine together the functionalities of nameko and the logic of celery is a good catch or a bad idea"
1667,1512744420.000708,Ciera,you want to expose an API over the network other than HTTP ?; nameko seems to be over http or AMQP
1667,1512744674.000104,Jacki,yes. I am trying to integrate it with AMQP

I tried convert the xml stream to json stream using xmltojson module .. after that I got the json steam ... But when I try to iterate over the json items I am getting error saying like.. attribute Error. 'str' object has no attribute 'items' ... I tried in Google but luck .. pls help me if u know the way to to
1667,1512746165.000414,Wade,<@Alexa> you are probably missing a conversion from json string to dict; json.loads(your_str)
1667,1512746200.000192,Alexa,I have that in my code ... ; A = json.loads(json.dump(xmltodict.parse(xmlstream))) this my conversation code; After this I am trying to iterate using for loop 
1667,1512746556.000672,Wade,"<@Jacki> i don't know if i understood your question. Are you worried about using nameko and celery in your service, because both are over AMQP protocol?"
1667,1512746609.000247,Meg,<@Alexa> why are you converting to json when you alreayd have xml to dict conversion?
1667,1512746643.000326,Wade,"<@Alexa> could you post the code here as pyhon snippet? And yeah, loads after dumps is nosense."
1667,1512746665.000602,Alexa,<@Meg>  i am not able extract data from dict.. also  
1667,1512746665.000612,Meg,"if I read your code right, you’re converting xml to a dict, then to json string, then load that string it as a dict; what do you get when you do `type(xmltodict.parse(stream))`?"
1667,1512746746.000109,Alexa,<@Meg> let me check
1667,1512746821.000308,Wade,that should be a dict; <https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict>

1667,1512746951.000757,Wade,<@Alexa> btw beware: json.dump and json.dumps are quite different methods

1667,1512747850.000419,Alexa,it was type mistake items only there..
1667,1512747907.000592,Meg,"eg

1667,1512747937.000459,Alexa,ok; lmc
1667,1512747943.00014,Meg,because its not an iterable by default

1667,1512748124.000236,Meg,that doesn’t make any sense at all; are you using `A = xmltodict(stream)`?
1667,1512748186.000224,Wade,"in your snippet ""i"" is one of the keys of a dict; and it's not possible it's a dict, because dicts are not hashable by default (probably OrderDicts are, but idk); (and dict keys needs to be hashable...ofc)"
1667,1512748499.000132,Jacki,"<@Wade> yes, I was wondering if it is a good solution in terms of performance and design. What I would like to have is an agnostic adapter for the APIs side of the application. Moreover, I’vent found that much about nameko and AMQP. Do you have any good example how to use it with Redis or Rabbit? Thanks a lot ; <@Tangela> could you show what kind of data your CSV have? "
1667,1512748650.00078,Alexa,<@Wade>  got it but it is not the key.. in dict let me ping the full code then u guys will get the clear idea ..
1667,1512748940.000173,Wade,"<@Tangela> other than the error you are getting (probably because that 'row' is invalid) , there is another kind of error (a LOT worst). You are exposing your system to be SQLInjected. If someone puts in that CSV a malicious snippet of SQL code, you run it in your database :slightly_smiling_face: look at psycopg2 docs and about SQLInjection generally <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>"
1667,1512749016.000212,Tangela,Thanks <@Wade>! going to check it
1667,1512749110.000316,Wade,"<@Jacki> no, i'm sorry. I've not used celery or nameko. I only heard of them and look'd at their API some time ago"
1667,1512749248.000289,Meg,"I use celery alot, but not with nameko; celery tasks are integrated with django apps, so I call them through regular django HTTP API calls"
1668,1512745042.0005,Alexa,Hi .. how to iterate over json stream.. to prient both key and value for all the items in the json steam.. pls help me on this ; Here is the full info ... 
1669,1512749953.000032,Season,"Hey slackers,  I started work for a new company 6 weeks ago, that is in desperate need of automation across the board..  I have been implementing python and bash scripts here and there to prove concepts and add some immediate value.  I want to step this up a notch and implement some type of integration platform that I can use to consume and push to rest APIs.   This is what I have been doing with python, bash and cron, but I’d like some sort of platform versus a bunch of scripts and cron.  I was looking at <https://zato.io/> and wondered what you all thought about it and if there are others I should check out as well."
1670,1512751290.000107,Patty,"That won’t prevent SQL injection, you’re putting the values directly into the query without sanitizing them; <http://bobby-tables.com/python>; though it depends on which database module you are using; Also, a small thing, but it’s a lot easier to share code/output on here with snippets or code formatting with backticks instead of screenshots"
1670,1512751975.000781,Wade,"idk MySQLdb syntax, so you should check the API yourself. Consider using psycopg2, which support almost all SQL drivers <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>; in the usage there is also the example to avoid SQLInjection"
1670,1512752346.000002,Patty,`psycopg2` supports other dialects?
1670,1512752398.000634,Keneth,you sure psycopg2 supports mysql?? I can't find anything about it mentioned in their documentation or anywhere else...
1670,1512752441.000212,Patty,I’m 99% sure `psycopg2` is specifically postgres
1670,1512752474.000089,Keneth,"for mysql he should be using MysqlDb, which also supports DB API2; me too, I got really surprised when I read such an statement"
1670,1512753933.000172,Wade,"<@Patty> <@Keneth> aww gawd, i'm so dumb. Yeah it's postgresql specific :sweat:"
1671,1512753286.000273,Tangela,"So, maybe should be better using a ORM like SQLAlchemy?"
1671,1512753758.000089,Glinda,"Realistically you should be using some type of framework that makes it so you don't have to write out the sql statements. I like sqlalchemy, but my experience level is like maybe a total of 50 hours. Some people here can provide you good alternatives."
1671,1512753991.000074,Wade,#sorry
1671,1512754019.000238,Tangela,"I used SQLAlchemy some years ago, was my first touch with a ORM, I guess will not be problematic try to implment,  anyway better that use pure sql statements. Thanks <@Wade>  <@Patty> <@Keneth> <@Glinda>"
1671,1512754089.000428,Keneth,"<@Tangela> if you are adventurous enough, give a try to peewee. A simpler and smaller ORM, but yet powerful enough. I've been using it with Flask and I love it.; it has extensions for some of the most used databases, and it's quite awesome. The author, owner and maintainer helps with doubts on Stackoverflow quite quickly.; anyway, there's no problem using SQL sentences, if you need them. But the DBApi2 interface supports parameters, which sanitizes the input for you for the values, so things like SQLInjection are less prone."
1671,1512755162.000526,Wade,<@Keneth> +1 for peewee. I tried it and was so smooth and easy
1672,1512755141.000101,Tennie,"Hi ... I am new to django and I keep running to migration problems like `django.db.utils.DatabaseError: ORA-00904: ""CORE_COMMAND"".""HIGH_RISK_JUSTIFICATION"": invalid identifier`.  Is there a trick in trouble shooting these sort of issues?"
1672,1512755165.000035,Meg,is this oracle?
1672,1512755178.000331,Tennie,yes
1672,1512755189.000007,Meg,"what happens when you google examples of that error; not sure how oracle handles it, but invalid identifier seems to me its a bad type or null value when there’s something expected"
1672,1512755314.000616,Tennie,oh its pretty clear that the column high_risk_justifitication does not exist in the core_command table.  But the the django core/model.py references that field.
1672,1512755329.000392,Meg,"did you make a migration?; a new one, that is"
1672,1512755344.000407,Tennie,and I have done the makemigrations and migrate
1672,1512755403.000401,Patty,is the first in the migrations?
1672,1512755419.000341,Meg,about the only thing I can think of is there’s some sort of migration out of order.
1672,1512755440.000267,Patty,or one didn’t generate correctly and the SQL may show the field wasnt being created
1672,1512755473.000477,Meg,"is this a new column name, or is it being re-used from a previously deleted/renamed column?"
1672,1512755683.000474,Tennie,There is a migration file that adds so I'd say it s new column
1672,1512755733.000327,Meg,do you set a default value for the field?
1672,1512755734.000152,Tennie,would zapping the pyc files help at all or be a disaster; I'll check for a default value; nope no default value
1672,1512755814.000158,Meg,"ok, if the field is not nullable, that’s a bad thing; because if you’re changing a db table by adding in a not null field,you need to specify _some_ value to be inserted"
1672,1512755843.00065,Tennie,"`    high_risk_justification = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)`; so I need to add a default?; looks like it is nullable ..."
1672,1512755903.000292,Meg,"what I’d do is remove `null = True`; <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/07/25/django-tip-8-blank-or-null.html>; &gt;Now, where most developers get it wrong: Defining null=True for string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. Avoid doing that. Otherwise, you will end up having two possible values for “no data”, that is: None and an empty string. Having two possible values for “no data” is redundant. The Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL."
1672,1512755987.000199,Tennie,would that fix my oracle ORA-00904 issue or is that just a best practice suggestion
1672,1512755994.000195,Meg,best practice; because I really don’t have a clue why that migration error is happening; if you run `manage.py migrate --list` do you have any unapplied migrations other than that one
1672,1512756046.000013,Tennie,cool thanks I'll try that; turned out that my django db user does not have privs to drop the tables before running my tests; so I had to log in via sqlplus as more priv'ed user and drop the tables
1673,1512760696.000632,Meg,interesting.  too bad the migration errror didn’t give more detail about that…; nice find though
1674,1512762393.000303,Lory,"after an `os.fork()`, from a a child process, how do I pick up from the parent process when the child calls `os._exit(n)`? I don't want my parent to wait on the child because I need to fork a few times, I just want to be able to poll for when all child processes have completed and then continue execution from there"
1674,1512762601.000094,Meg,is there any way you can refactor from fork to use suprocess instead?
1674,1512762666.000532,Lory,"That's the eventual goal but I'm trying to understand the root basics of forks and inter process communication before I use subprocess to hide the details; That and I tried it with subprocess first when I initially wrote the code but failed and ended up running everything in serial instead because it was simpler and faster to develop, but now I have time to go back and learn more about it so I'm starting at the very bottom; It's easier to learn when I can see the actual forks and exits and everything happening within the code itself"

1676,1512785887.000084,Corrinne,"It doesn't quite work like that in Python.

1678,1512816109.000016,Louis,"<@Tangela>: You should never do it that way; it's actually usually simpler to do it without a `.format()`.; And it's not just about SQL injection attacks; you have to quote the values correctly just for the query to work correctly at all, in the first place, so you don't have problems like the above."
1678,1512816836.000049,Tangela,"<@Louis> I know that's dangerous, I am just using this way because is I'm trying to find the error point so I did simple just to debug easier.

1678,1512842050.000058,Glinda,"it could be that by marking it private, it's preventing the patching from not working, because you're trying to access a private method.; I'm not really sure"

1687,1513007819.000406,Patty,Celery is generally running on redis or rabbitMQ
1687,1513007826.000578,Jacki,"yes; but, let say that you have to send tasks to the application where celery runs; i was wondering how to you communicate with it"
1687,1513007870.000782,Meg,is this using a web app?
1687,1513007873.000634,Jacki,no; only backend services
1687,1513007892.000101,Meg,"ok.  I use django, which integrates well with celery; so you have your `tasks` module"
1687,1513007919.000331,Patty,"Can you expand on “communicate”? Are you looking to send tasks, receive them, etc?"
1687,1513007978.000386,Jacki,"let say I have a serviceA which has tasks to be consumerd; consumed; and let say that serviceB is my Celery application in charge of dealing with tasks; how I can request to serviceB to run tasks?; so, in other words,; how do you expose the APIs of the serviceB; ?; <@Patty>, yes i am looking to send tasks"
1687,1513008126.00095,Meg,"makes sense.

what I do is each django app’s celery tasks are integrated with the exposed api for that app; where some POST requests explicitly trigger one or many tasks"
1687,1513008172.000633,Jacki,"ok, but what if I do not have django but just a stand alone backend application; that just does one job"
1687,1513008186.000632,Meg,just follow the regular celery documentation; should be the same; that would handle executing tasks
1687,1513008218.000047,Jacki,"oh well, is what I am doing, but still something it’s not that clear"
1687,1513008226.000196,Meg,what do you mean?
1687,1513008235.000399,Jacki,"moreover, I have to put that application into a docker container, so; I need to communicate with that service"
1687,1513008299.0004,Meg,"uhm, I think you’re not entirely understanding of what celery is"
1687,1513008323.000806,Jacki,"i am pretty new to Celery, but this is my structure; ‘’’json; docker-cluster-with-celery-and-rabbitmq
  -- test_celery
    -- __init__.py
    -- celery.py
    -- tasks.py
    -- run_tasks.py
  -- docker-compose.yml
  -- dockerfile
  -- requirements.txt; so, I am able to run tasks, such as sending emails; but, my question is, do I need to integrate Celery with django or I can use it; in a stand alone application adding a layer of communication; like, RPC or REST or whatever; and use it just as a distributed task Q"
1687,1513008472.000136,Meg,"hmm, ok.  So to be clear, celery consists of three parts:
worker, broker and task; you’ve already written up the tasks; and you apparently already use rabbit to handle the task queueing"
1687,1513008521.000192,Myong,Can anyone recommend a library for grabbing an address from coordinates?
1687,1513008525.000562,Meg,"the worer is completely de-coupled from everything, and just listens to messages from the broker; geocoding?; so you have that cluster and communication, <@Jacki>; thing is, tasks are highly specific, are they not?; you can use OOP and task classes to create levels of inheritance, but in the end, a task is highly specific to the thing it is supposed to do"
1687,1513008634.000436,Jacki,"true; but still, if i have to send 100 email to 100 users; I have to communicate the array of those 100 email addresses"
1687,1513008669.000298,Meg,no
1687,1513008677.000385,Jacki,"oh,"
1687,1513008682.00009,Meg,"well, yeah.  but not exactly; you have the data from your backend service; you post it to your rabbit broker; and the workers pick it up"
1687,1513008749.000556,Patty,<@Jacki> do you _want_ to handle sending emails to users? that can be a mess and end up with your email server running into all kinds of problems when it starts getting blacklisted. if youre looking to move this up to production-level i’d integrate with an external mailing service
1687,1513008762.000043,Jacki,"and I suppose it’s the same with Redis; <@Patty>, yes I already have an external mailing service where all the stuff; and basically yes I have to send email mgs as result of some actions"
1687,1513008848.000395,Meg,"so, long story short, you can indeed make a service layer of sorts to handle the task calling and execution; question is, does having this explicit layer make sense in your overall application and project structure?"
1687,1513008892.00081,Jacki,"well, yes because I can only send a payload to a serviceA; and I don’t have to take care of broker; or other technology stack"
1687,1513008918.000763,Meg,uhm you _do_
1687,1513008922.000829,Jacki,serviceA will be in charge of

1687,1513008939.000259,Meg,or for any kind of asynchronous task queue
1687,1513008947.000575,Jacki,"oh yes, serviceA has celery and use Redis in my example; and he has a public endpoint; just to receive the work to perform; is that make sense?"
1687,1513009066.000042,Meg,"What I get from you is Service A is a backend service, and you need it to pass off async tasks to celery workers."

1687,1513009184.000436,Jacki,"yes is what I did; but,; in my local env; I have one console with the celery worker runs; and another one where I run the serviceA; in order to expose the APIs"

1687,1513009768.00052,Jacki,what do you suggest for production?

1687,1513010074.000645,Meg,"if all you’re doing is sending out emails with this, then yeah; much better ways to handle that"

1687,1513010786.000824,Jacki,"great.; cool, I know how I’ll spend the rest of the day; thanks again; I’ll try to sort it out; but may I ask you why you don’t like the docker solution; for a production env; i mean, docker is strong enough and reliable; is it something related to celery itself ?"
1687,1513010922.000386,Meg,"just don’t see the need for it; because celery workers are already daemonized; so, why go through the docker layer?"
1687,1513010985.000734,Jacki,"to have a configuration ready to start in different env; you do the conf once, you can repeat everywhere, even localy"

1687,1513011127.000369,Jacki,ok
1687,1513011171.000446,Meg,"that said, I am going to be teaching myself docker this winter.  It has benefits I can use; but I just don’t see any distinct advantage to containerizing celery on dedicated servers that are wholly responsible for async workers"
1687,1513011261.000042,Jacki,portability is one of the main advantages; your container is not  coupled to your server

1692,1513017251.000307,Enid,"Question: I have a server-side application that automates downloading a bunch of excel files, performs some ETL, and writes them to a SQL db. I have like 30 functions that contain each search (automated through selenium, and the site's HTML doesn't really lend itself to iterating through those searches in a single function). I currently have one master function that calls all 31 functions, but is there a more pythonic way to run all of these searches without calling every function in another function? It just looks amtuerish to me."
1692,1513017990.000075,Antionette,Are the functions just different in terms of the search arguments they're called with or are they actually different functions?
1692,1513018093.000605,Nicole,"Also, is this a blocking function or are you using some sort of task queue like Celery?"
1692,1513019031.000001,Enid,<@Antionette> They are different functions.; <@Nicole> I'm not using a task queue.

1693,1513019844.00071,Ciera,There is the arrow lib <@Suellen> showed you or `datetime.strptime`
1693,1513019849.000468,Suellen,do you know the timezone?

I have little problem with performance may little function:

Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
The function takes the parameter: n (n always n &gt; 0) and returns an list of the form: `[(a, b), ...]`
It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array if no possible numbers are found.
#Example:
```
removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]

1699,1513076306.0001,Ciera,oh yeah my bad. you should cast it to an int. `int(n/2)`
1699,1513076504.000018,Hipolito,"but still it does not give the intended effect because now `a` is max 12 and as you can see an example, `a` is equal to 15 and in the next tuple 21; a is x; and should check all possible pairs of numbers"
1699,1513076610.0004,Ciera,ah yeah my bad. I wasn't sure a `/2` would work.; anyways you can do two loops in `range(n + 1)`. (forgot the +1 also :p); that's quite fast; it's the `map/filter` that are longer I suppose; I'm going to go eat something. I can make a better snippet afterwards if needed :slightly_smiling_face:
1699,1513076943.00042,Hipolito,"unfortunately, I have tried this too and it is even slower; ```def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    total = sum(numbers)
    result = []
    for first in numbers:
        for second in numbers:
            if first == second:
                continue
            if first * second == total - (first + second):
                result.append((first, second))
    return result```; this work nice if we have numbers below 100; and after I try this way:; ```def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    pairs = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))
    total = sum(numbers)
    result = []
    for first, second in pairs:
        if first * second == total - (first + second):
            result.append((first, second))
            result.append((second, first))
    return result```; still to slow; Bon Appetit,
and I would be very grateful for your help.; I'm back to work now if you find something please send to me directly, thx :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,1513077740.000297,Ciera,I'm not sure what are the limits of `n` are but I think once you reach higher number you need to be clever about it and skip ranges of number.
1699,1513077792.000165,Fabiola,"Problem has piqued my curiosity! Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, <@Ciera>. Have to think about the mathematics of the problem and find a shortcut so you don't need to compute so much; which for large `n` should cut out a lot of pairs; For instance, you don't need to check pairs where both numbers are greater than `sqrt(sum(range(n)))`"
1700,1513078186.000248,Ciera,"I win a big chunk of time by removing the `list` from  `list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))` as it's not usefull"
1700,1513078231.00027,Fabiola,"What's the complexity of the naive approach? `sum(range(n))` is `n(n-1)/2`, and then by comparing all pairs, you check `n(n-1)/2 * n(n-1)/2` pairs; So the complexity is essentially `O(n**4)`?; `n**2*(n-1)**2/4` pairs to check"
1700,1513078490.000098,Hipolito,let's say that `n` will not exceed 1k
1700,1513078735.000096,Fabiola,"By checking for `(first  &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n)))) and (second &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n))))`, you can reduce that to..."
1700,1513078741.000244,Hipolito,"but anyway, from what I was leaving it, I do not know if it comes `n` to until 1k.
I suspect that the max is much lower."
1700,1513078915.000044,Fabiola,"If I'm not wrong, even if n=1000 that still requires checking 249500250000 pairs of numbers"
1700,1513079037.000157,Hipolito,"Well, that's a lot.
But as I said, I do not think it ever came to n = 1000.
I think it's going to be hard to make it halfway. (n=500); for research purposes, let's set it for not more than 300.; not only do you worry about the speed of action. If, for example, I have to check with 50 x `n` where `n` &lt; 100; for this, this function should be as fast as possible"
1700,1513079334.000027,Ciera,It also depends what is as fast as possible. Maybe there are solutions in C library
1700,1513079577.000309,Hipolito,"I do not say that it must be done in this way, it is completely different solution that will give the desired result; oki, then how this need looks?; I'm just learning this fascinating language and I can not get everything in flight yet.; Any hint how it should look like? :slightly_smiling_face:"
1700,1513080519.000343,Fabiola,"Your code earlier looked really nice. On the whole, list comprehensions are much faster than `for` loops, so I think your first answer looked pretty good. Like <@Ciera> suggested, you can remove the `list`structure"
1700,1513080625.000411,Hipolito,"oki, <@Ciera>, <@Fabiola> thanks for your help :slightly_smiling_face:; :+1:"
1700,1513080970.000201,Fabiola,"You can use the `itertools.product` to find combinations of the `range(n*(n-1)/2)` and `range(np.sqrt(n*(n-1)/2)`; And because the product is symmetric, at the end you can reverse all the pairs you have found and add them to the solution set; ie. if `(a, b)` is a solution, then so is `(b, a)`."
1700,1513081086.000517,Hipolito,"nice; Check it out as soon as I find a moment because now I am at work :slightly_smiling_face: and will certainly write back what I sent. Once again, thanks a lot for your help"
1700,1513081234.000324,Fabiola,"Yeah, me too, it's an interesting problem! I'll try an run some of my own benchmarks to see if my calculations reflect reality ^^; And <@Hipolito> you can give tacos to people if you found them helpful  :taco:"

1701,1513086591.000213,Nickolas,"Hi all,
Has anybody successfully bundled OpenCV and PyQt using PyInstaller on OSX?  I’m having a nightmare getting it to work.    Everything works perfectly before bundling with PyInstaller, however when I run the app created by PyInstaller I get the following error:; If I comment out the ‘import cv2’ the app works (but without the opencv functionality obviously)"
1701,1513086641.000668,Meg,"IIRC, opencv dependencies are a pita to make portable"
1701,1513086666.000153,Nickolas,Is there a better alternative?
1701,1513086685.000535,Meg,I just installed the deps using a linux vm; and added the python binaries via a virtualenv
1701,1513086708.000212,Nickolas,I am attempting to create a short video file from individual image frames; Installing deps on a linux vm won’t help me build an OSX app though will it?
1701,1513086873.000392,Meg,"nope; so, with this, seems like its worth escalating to the pyinstaller repostitory issue page or going to the opencv mailing list"
1701,1513086961.000036,Nickolas,Ok will do.  Thanks for the indo!; *Info
1701,1513086996.000552,Meg,"good luck :slightly_smiling_face:; that said, there are a number of projects where packaging is a pain, I feel; opencv is one; gis is another (geodjango, etc); and depending on the machine/OS, numpy/scipy, pandas…"
1701,1513093035.000539,Glinda,But right now both sub loggers are duplicating the file.
1701,1513093053.000615,Ciera,FYI you can also use yaml for the config file (can be more readdable :slightly_smiling_face: )
1701,1513093062.000663,Glinda,I saw that; I'm kind of regretting the json
1701,1513093076.000237,Ciera,there is a key to deactivate that
1701,1513093104.000048,Glinda,So both `new_event_logger` and `all_event_logger` have the same data.
1701,1513093104.000232,Ciera,see <https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/config/prod.config.yml#L96>; ah no you already have it
1701,1513093126.000302,Glinda,"` ""disable_existing_loggers"": false,`; Maybe something to do with root?"
1701,1513093191.000325,Ciera,the root logger use both handlers; how do you log a message ? `<http://all_event_logger.info|all_event_logger.info>('my log')` ?
1701,1513093232.000156,Glinda,Yes
1701,1513093285.000215,Ciera,I'm not a pro on logging but your config seems fine to me :confused:
1701,1513093324.000258,Glinda,"maybe something to do with my setup function?; <https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/utils/log_manager.py>; Not sure if I need to have ```logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
new_event_logger = logging.getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')``` within that file"
1701,1513093404.000621,Ciera,you shouldn't use `__name__` there.; name is the python path of the file `mymodule.submodule.filename`; so you don't get the correct logger
1701,1513093467.000578,Glinda,Cause I'm using `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`
1701,1513093476.00062,Ciera,you should do `logging.getLogger('my_module.new_member')`
1701,1513093899.000082,Glinda,I think that's working better :slightly_smiling_face:
1701,1513093972.00064,Ciera,for `all_events` it could be interesting to just set the message in DEBUG mode and log the debug elsewhere; haha I see you also had some trouble with the stupid `Bot ID`. I can't understand why they haven't changed that yet
1701,1513094051.000278,Glinda,"I'm not even sure if I need it.; But was working with someone and he included that utility to get the bot id; This first iteration we are just using the RTM, the next step is to turn it into an app so we can incorporate buttons. Do you know if that's something your wrapper can do?"
1701,1513094148.000096,Ciera,"the wrapper doesn't handle button by itself but yeah it can handle messages with buttons.; try the `/gif` command to see some buttons :wink:; it's a bit of work to get buttons and commands working correctly as you will need a webserver, Most likely Django, Flask or an async one; you should use `logger.exception(e)` here; <https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/src/app.py#L117>; so no need to do the traceback thingy"
1701,1513094338.000218,Glinda,"Yeah, probably go with flask at first.; I saw you were working on a curio implementation; I really wanted to learn async using curio first.; Been hearing lots of crap about asyncio"
1701,1513094517.000134,Ciera,"I have never really used it, I usually stick to the standard python async; well it works for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1701,1513094559.000766,Glinda,I don't disagree
1701,1513094647.000477,Ciera,but I can understand that there is other implementations that are easier to get into
1701,1513094753.000097,Glinda,"```  while True:
            try:
                parse_slack_output(slack_client.rtm_read())

1704,1513106426.000344,Virgen,"Short Question: Is it possible to use a MS Office file as a source to render a webpage with one of the web frameworks? If so, what would you use? (I am looking for a simple yes/no on the possible question. And if possible, just direct me to the package/module and I'll read the docs from there...)

Long Version: Our IT dept keeps our documentation in a bunch of MS office files. It is all quite well organized and standardized. A directory for each area of IT (network, storage, vmware, voip, etc). Each folder has a single .docx, a .xlsx, and a .vsdx.
The issue we run into is that we rarely update but frequently reference. Since we all have RW permissions to the files, whenever we open one of them, it locks the file so no one else can edit. So, whenever we have to make an edit, we have to find who has it open and ask them to close it.
Its not enough of a bother for anyone else to have done anything about it, much less be willing to spend anything on a better solution.
So, my thinking is that if I could use my django server (on which I am still learning...) to host a webapp that would render a page from each of those files, we could use that as reference and only open the file when we need to make an update. 

My general thoughts on the high level program would be as follows:
1. point the program at the root directory. 
2. it would generate links for each folder, once clicked, it would display another set of links for subdirs or files. If files, it would display a page rendered with the content of the office file. If folder, display links to folder contents, rinse repeate.

I dont know how to do any of this, yet. I'll figure it out.
What I am looking for is if it is even possible to render a page with Django using a MS Office file as a source.
If I know I can do that, I'll figure out the rest. 
If that is not possible, I wont be wasting my time trying to figure it out...

Thank you for any input!"

1727,1513267755.000109,Junita,"I’d go the multiprocessing route over threading, but yeah, like <@Joann> said - depends how much you care; could be a good excuse to try the technique though"
1727,1513267782.000719,Myong,Currently sitting at my desk awaiting completion so I got 20 minutes lol
1727,1513267824.000662,Junita,heh; I mean if it’s something you have to wait for the result for then I’d say yes.  How many cores does your machine have?
1727,1513268065.000611,Antionette,"if the work you're doing is cpu bound I'm not sure if traditional multi-threading will help that much, wouldn't it be stuck on one core anyway?"
1727,1513268092.00015,Myong,8 total with hyperthreading
1727,1513268092.00043,Joann,"huh? no; well, idk what you mean by 'traditional multi-threading' to be fair, but Linux threads will certainly get you access to multiple CPUs..."
1727,1513268202.000273,Ciera,In pure cpython you are block by the GIL
1727,1513268213.000208,Antionette,I meant python threads vs a library like multi processing
1727,1513268217.000726,Myong,<@Antionette> I believe `ThreadPoolExecutor` works properly
1727,1513268219.000086,Ciera,you need to drop in C or use multiprocessing
1727,1513268256.000462,Joann,"oh, ugh, forgot which slack I was on. :); silly python"
1727,1513268275.000427,Myong,"Multithreading for IO bound, Multiprocess for CPU bound"
1727,1513268289.000642,Ciera,really good talk about concurrency in python <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zinZmE3Ogk> :slightly_smiling_face:
1727,1513268294.000851,Myong,IIRC; How many processes should I have running at once?
1727,1513268356.000147,Joann,"with 8 HTs, I'd probably try 10; you could time that and then vary the # of processes and see if there's much change"
1727,1513268399.000284,Ciera,n° of core + 1 is the rule I heard but I don't really know :smile:
1727,1513268413.000621,Joann,"it really depends on a lot of different things, heh."
1727,1513268418.000058,Suellen,yeah; very hard even to estimate
1727,1513268435.000877,Joann,The difference is likely to be relatively small in total runtime anyway tho.
1727,1513268452.000362,Suellen,but it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot and make parallel code work slower than one-core-one-thread; RE: multiprocessing communication overhead
1727,1513268739.000287,Myong,Now the attempt to get `tqdm` to work with this
1727,1513268801.000239,Fabiola,<@Myong> Looks like you can afford to spend about a day or two on this before you wipe out any gains in time you make over a year: <https://xkcd.com/1205/>; Assuming you shave 5-10 minutes off the task
1727,1513268853.000481,Ciera,haha nice chart :smile:
1727,1513268874.000588,Suellen,relevant xkcd!
1727,1513268908.000332,Ciera,I like how some are greyed out. Like `you should have already done it` :smile:; today's one was kind of happy/sad
1727,1513268958.000902,Suellen,oh no
1727,1513269015.000265,Fabiola,"wow, yeah, hadn't read it yet"
1727,1513269050.000239,Seema,"<@Myong> have you checked your time-complexity, for example, do you have inner and outer for loops?  also have you profiled the code at all?"
1727,1513269061.000875,Myong,Yeah I ran a profile on it; It's basically a word likeness algorithm that runs on a few thousand inputs
1727,1513269101.000913,Fabiola,"<@Myong> I don't know what the task is, but would it be possible to run it as a cron job before you need it, so you're not actually waiting for it?"
1727,1513269119.000444,Myong,It spends about 97% of the time inside a single function
1727,1513269124.000109,Fabiola,Or is it something you need to run on up to date data when you get it?
1727,1513269125.000157,Suellen,hope it's not the slow Levenstein
1727,1513269139.000386,Myong,It's useing `FuzzyWuzzy`; <https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy>
1727,1513269202.000304,Ciera,it might be a good opportunity to learn cython :smile:
1727,1513269226.000391,Myong,You could be correct; I'm just not busy at work and trying to improve this little script
1727,1513269271.000407,Seema,"""cheap"" ways to *potentially* increase speed are to compile the program or try pypy, though reference that time chart for pypy :wink:"
1727,1513269375.000118,Myong,Okay I'll check it out
1727,1513269386.000856,Ciera,yeah pypi is a good idea :thumbsup:
1727,1513269409.000417,Seema,"lol, I can never get the name right"
1727,1513269410.000805,Myong,the python package index?; Oh I got confused for a sec
1727,1513269456.000597,Seema,"pypy is a python compiled python interpreter, no C underneath"
1727,1513269456.000797,Ciera,haha no I go it wrong you got it right <@Seema>
1727,1513269466.000907,Seema,lol
1727,1513269471.000616,Suellen,what's happenin
1727,1513269476.000867,Myong,wait isnt that pypy?; LOL
1727,1513269481.000572,Suellen,I'm confused
1727,1513269498.000393,Ciera,<https://pypy.org/> != <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>
1727,1513269515.000107,Suellen,"right, so i'm not having a stroke; that's good"
1727,1513269523.000488,Myong,what a rush; <@Ciera> so <http://pypy.org|pypy.org> and download the interpreter?
1727,1513269542.000109,Ciera,!= <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pipi>; yeah with a bit of luck it should automagically work
1727,1513269609.000346,Junita,it shouldn’t?  :stuck_out_tongue:
1727,1513269617.000562,Myong,Hopefully im not lucky
1727,1513269627.000443,Seema,"*IIRC*, you need python to use C to use python to create the python interpreter so not as easy as ""download the interpreter"", you'll need to build it.  Last I saw it was a long build time.; can someone tell me I'm wrong and that you can download it?"
1727,1513269657.000619,Ciera,it's late here :coffee: :cry:
1727,1513269660.000783,Myong,I have a download im looking at here
1727,1513269664.000085,Junita,I think there’s a binary distribution for it.
1727,1513269666.000044,Myong,BUT Idk
1727,1513269693.000345,Seema,"at the very least, you'll learn a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,1513269756.000339,Myong,Looks like they have SVM here <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/>
1727,1513269789.0003,Seema,Where are you at?
1727,1513269817.000319,Ciera,I'm in belgium. It's not that late but it's getting dark
1727,1513269856.000048,Seema,"My brother-in-law lived there for 10+ years, he's from California so there was a bit of weather shock.  He loved it otherwise.; I think he lived in Leuven, spoke Dutch and English, had to learn French"
1727,1513269906.000156,Ciera,yeah the weather is not too good at the moment :disappointed:; Leuven is pretty nice.
1727,1513269943.000304,Seema,he tells the story of over a 100 days of no sun and he had an upcoming bike trip
1727,1513269971.000519,Ciera,haha 100 days of no sun is a bit exagerated :smile: we are not England
1727,1513269974.000466,Seema,"just as he goes on his trip, the sun opens up for 5 or 6 days and he has this glorious ride and then it goes back to cloudy, he said the whole country kinda slumps"
1727,1513270064.000718,Ciera,well it's a shithole afterall :trollface: :trump:
1727,1513270080.000478,Seema,are you Belgian?
1727,1513270125.000102,Ciera,yeah. I was born in France but moved to belgium when I was 12
1727,1513270140.000121,Myong,Alright about to try it out
1727,1513270202.000802,Ciera,where are you at ? I suppose US west ?
1727,1513270221.000399,Seema,"northern California, east of San Francisco; it's been 4 to 16 degrees out here and I'm not use to this, I'm from southern california; I have thermals and ear muffs , often in the house"
1727,1513270284.000728,Ciera,is that °F or °C ?
1727,1513270287.000129,Seema,C
1727,1513270306.000744,Ciera,ah yeah that's pretty cool for California; it's around 0° here; you don't have good heating in the house ? More focused on cooling usually ?
1727,1513270362.000489,Seema,"brrr, I live on the way to the mountains so if I was a skiing fan this would be great, about 2 hours to some great slopes.  Too bad I can't deal with the cold.; Most of the houses in US are old double-pane windows that no longer hold the insulation, often about 2000square feet, so the heaters are kind of useless, the concern in most of the state is air conditioning"
1727,1513270450.00044,Ciera,yeah well I guess in the south temperature are usually higher.
1727,1513270464.000188,Seema,"It's highly variable too, in San Francisco, you might never use your heater but a couple of weeks a year because the proximity to the ocean keeps the temperature even"
1727,1513270494.000815,Ciera,at least in Belgium house have good insulation and heating; but then in the summer when there is a bit of sun nobody can handle it
1727,1513270519.000431,Seema,"central california is a giant, and I mean HUGE valley, easily ges in the 100s.... errr 40+, part of southern california too but the closer to the beach, the less craziness, the more expensive, nice community,etc"
1727,1513270538.00064,Ciera,I couldn't deal with 40+ :smile:
1727,1513270539.000054,Seema,is air conditioning a normal thing to have?
1727,1513270549.001005,Ciera,"no, nobody has it"
1727,1513270583.000015,Seema,"that's interesting, how many times a year would you say it's needed?"
1727,1513270584.000309,Ciera,you would only use it for a few weeks over the year. nt worth it
1727,1513270628.000066,Seema,"Seattle is like that and they've been having warm, dry summers.  My (ex) co-workers were miseable, weeks of hot, muggy, no relief, no way to cool at night; you working on any interesting projects?"
1727,1513270671.000436,Ciera,yeah it's usually like that. But temp rarely reach 30; Average should be about 24-25 in the summer
1727,1513270707.000589,Seema,that's nice!
1727,1513270726.000372,Ciera,"Yeah I was working on making our postgresql replicate, and before that on a SIP server with asyncio; pretty cool stuff to do; and you ?"
1727,1513270783.000172,Seema,"lately, tinkering, I'm hobbyist not full-time programmer.  I've been playing with Dask <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>; Also, been trying to figure out how I can level up, my decorators, metaclasses, context managers, properties knowledge is non-existent; do you roll your own SIP?"
1727,1513270865.000598,Ciera,"I don't really know anything about datascience / analytics in python but it looks interesting :smile:; well it's always by doing that you learn, there is no secret."
1727,1513270900.000484,Seema,true
1727,1513270918.000798,Ciera,No but we have the need for a custom SIP server/proxy in some specific cases
1727,1513270952.00013,Seema,"I used to manage the VOIP and the Lync servers, some of that stuff is black magic, some of it cool, most of it a pain"
1727,1513270952.00043,Ciera,If you haven't already watched them I can recommend all the raymond hettinger talks
1727,1513270989.000156,Seema,"I like his, then I'll balance it with a Dave Beazley talk just to keep it light, lol"
1727,1513270994.000045,Ciera,Most of it was a pain to do :smile: but we got something working. It's not perfect but does the job; <https://github.com/Eyepea/aiosip>
1727,1513271007.000229,Seema,"""proto-duction"""
1727,1513271016.000124,Ciera,David Beazley is like the crazy uncle of python; I have to go. talk to you later :wave:
1727,1513271060.000013,Seema,take it easy; o/
1727,1513271127.000024,Myong,Alright installed the binaries but there is no actual binary anywhere
1727,1513271195.000607,Junita,start a new shell session?
1727,1513271247.000208,Myong,On Windows fyi (save me). But it's nowhere at all let me see if this works gonna download one of the newer binaries; ahhh there it is
1727,1513271292.00061,Junita,"ah, no idea about windows.  :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,1513271317.000562,Myong,Yeah I got it. I guess I downloaded the source but for some reason there was no distinction between the two
1727,1513272455.000423,Meg,"but not sure whether you’d be able to hook into the subprocess.  that might be best left as a standalone debug, where your inputs match those from the subprocess call"
1728,1513271571.00052,Myong,Alright im excited to see how this works with  pypy; just as slow so far in pypy as normal python build; :disappointed:; Sweet! Implemented multiprocess and the speed has doubled so far non pypy
1728,1513272343.000827,Seema,"<@Myong> play around with it, I've even heard of things initially going slower on pypy before going MANY times faster; nice"
1728,1513272373.00044,Myong,Worth running on pypy with multiprocessing?
1728,1513272413.000801,Meg,"<@Mirian> if you set `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` in settings, then the worker will run synchronously and you’ll be able to debug in pycharm"
1728,1513272541.000081,Seema,"that's a good question (euphemism for I don't actually know), though pypy is an interpreter with a GIL, I would imagine you'd see improvements; do tell how it turns out if you do"
1728,1513272585.000481,Myong,okay about to start
1728,1513272793.000379,Mirian,"I can debug celery worker itself, just cannot figure out how to setup breakpoints within Python script executed with subprocess; debugging the rest of the code works :slightly_smiling_face:"
1728,1513272846.000808,Meg,the problem is that the subprocess runs on an entirely different process than what the debugger is attached to
1728,1513272916.000445,Mirian,there is a settings `attach to subprocess automatically while debugging` <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-debugger.html>; but maybe it's an external process; and I've misunderstood that
1728,1513272962.000257,Meg,I’ve never had any success with that; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1728,1513272996.000103,Mirian,"anyway, thanks for the tips <@Meg> :taco:"
1728,1513273874.000026,Myong,Moment of truth for pypy w/multiprocessing; It's slowly going up. 10% through and its gone from 1.5 it/s to 2.35 it/s and keeps climbing
1729,1513272300.000859,Mirian,"Hello, I've got a celery worker that runs task that involves calling `subprocess.check_call(cmd)`. The cmd is a Python script. Is it possible to debug it using Pycharm inside a Celery worker debugger?"
1730,1513273974.000504,Myong,"<@Seema> Starting out as fast as normal python interpreter w/out MP, but im gonna let it run the full length and see what happens"
1730,1513274036.000529,Seema,cool; what are you using to display the number of iterations per second?
1730,1513274080.000008,Myong,`tqdm`!; Awesome library for progress bar; And I just found the code to work alongside multiprocessing
1730,1513274156.00028,Seema,"seems like a win, take the rest of the week off!  lol j/k"
1730,1513274200.000984,Myong,That's what I'm saying
1730,1513274333.000372,Suellen,pypy often requires warming up; such is life with JIT
1730,1513274466.000558,Myong,Just read up on JIT so now I understand; <@Seema> half way through at 2.65 it/s so about 35% slower than normal python atm both w/MP; Time for cython?
1730,1513274630.000818,Suellen,that's a strange result
1730,1513274645.000002,Myong,could I possibly have too many workers?; I have 8 total cores and 10 workers; should i drop it down and see what happens
1730,1513274950.000349,Suellen,"<@Myong> how does the pool communicate with the main process?; do you submit something to the pools, or just tell it where to read from, or..?"
1730,1513275012.000072,Myong,"I submit them with list comprehension; `futures = [executor.submit(self.find_match, radio) for radio in self.missing_list]`"
1730,1513275069.000339,Suellen,and what's the typical size of the submitted data?
1730,1513275084.000503,Myong,It's a string usually no longer than ~20 characters
1730,1513275091.000089,Suellen,"huh; I'm not 95% sure it's a communication overhead; each piece of data needs to be serialized, transmitted to the process, and deserialized. And then the same when the process finishes and communicates the result back"
1730,1513275144.000386,Myong,Its just weird cause the normal interpreter improved ~80% from the MP
1730,1513275167.00067,Suellen,maybe PyPy was already fast so less room for improvement?; what if you submitted a chunk of data each time? like a hundred entries or so
1730,1513275192.000362,Myong,Difference in speed is `2.55 it/s vs 3.9 it/s`
1730,1513275239.000117,Seema,too much fuel in the carb! lol
1730,1513275422.000331,Myong,ugh now `with open()` in pypy can't take the `newline=''` argument
1730,1513277116.000625,Suellen,mine does :open_mouth:
1730,1513280314.000615,Myong,:disappointed:
1730,1513282299.000466,Mirian,<@Meg> I've figured it out! This script was an setup.py's script and I've changed it to the actual path of the file
1731,1513280468.000508,Suellen,how is it going?
1731,1513281204.000303,Myong,"I haven't run it in a bit, but it was still running around 2.7 it/s"
1731,1513281335.000386,Suellen,:disappointed:; is it public code?
1731,1513282307.000015,Mirian,and it now magically works; but I'm not sure why :stuck_out_tongue:
1732,1513283918.000566,Myong,It is not. It's just a small script that deals with data that's not very sensitive. I'm gonna profile it again on pycharm w/PyPy
1732,1513284417.000235,Suellen,alright
1732,1513284680.000461,Myong,"<@Suellen> huh, I just found something interesting; downloaded the 3.5 version binaries, but python 2.7 installed..."
1732,1513284723.000399,Seema,how did you install and invoke python?
1732,1513284836.000202,Myong,So Installed it from their nightly py3.5 branch here; <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/>; I downloaded the top most `pypy-c-jit-latest-win32.zip`
1732,1513284879.000702,Seema,"and when you type python, 2.7 comes up?"
1732,1513284886.000479,Myong,"When I go into the directory; And open up pypy.exe; I see python 2.7.13; `Python 2.7.13 (5ef9bb870cd2, Dec 14 2017, 07:11:07)`"
1732,1513284926.000561,Suellen,:open_mouth:
1732,1513284939.000429,Myong,How does that work lmao

The product was a commodity so buying was mostly based on availability and price and not features; he implemented an ingest system and said to the suppliers, ""this is our system, here are the tools to adhere, we'll even teach you, if you don't adhere, we will buy from the other companies that do.""; there was a bunch of squabbling but my dad's company won because a) they were a big buyer and b) the tech the companies were offering was awful (word docs, xeroxed sheets, faxes(!))"

I am building a platform which retrieves order data of multiple webshops, those orders have different suppliers (depending on the products).

Each of these suppliers have complete different API's. Expect data to be mapped differently and have different features. For example:

Supplier #1 has ""Post Order"" (POST to API), ""Get Stock"" (from FTP), ""Get Order Status"" (from FTP).
Supplier #2 has ""Post Order"" (SOAP WSDL), ""Get Stock"" (SOAP WSDL).
Supplier #3 has ""Post Order"" (Through E-mail)

We have a ""BaseSupplier"" class right now, and want every feature to be a mixin (""PostOrderMixin"", ""GetStockMixin"", ""GetOrderStatusMixin""). However, these Mixins still just have abstract functions because the actual implementation for a supplier is so different. But I'm not really able to move forward on this right now because it's starting to feel ugly..

You're front end would be handling the ""real time"" updates, i'm familar with using Angular or Knockout.js to bind elements to data models.

1742,1513362300.000165,Corrinne,in your case you might be better off using a get request; <https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/>; You may also have to pip install the flask-cors package
1742,1513362674.000421,Devorah,"ok so now I have 4 lists it looks like, but it still has the \n; but if I put in rsplit() in it I can strip it but then it shows up as ``` ['nick|julius08025978', '']

['robot|jones|08041872', '']

1745,1513367602.0001,Adan,"Hi everyone, I started to implement a simple web service for image processing in Python 3.6.3. High throughput is very important, because we do real time processing. The concept is very simple - download image from azure blob storage -&gt; resize -&gt; apply some filters -&gt; response.  So I used Flask for the first prototype, after few load tests I realized that we need something asynchronous, so I switched to Tornado. But the problem of overloading still persists, I have only ~77% success requests for 250 concurrent users, which is sad (I use visual studio online load tests). I use single core VM for testing, on another similar VM I run our existing resizer written in C#, which handles loads perfectly with 100% request rate (tho single request is much slower). The logs don't have any failed requests, which means that the failed requests didn't even come into the web server request pool... I use docker container BTW, and odd thing is that CPU has ~65% load idle, tho the python processes consume 0% idle... This is my first ever web Python experience, so I'm frustrated a little bit, may be some help would be appreciated. Could it be a problem of Tornado? Docker? Should I try Sanic or japronto? Should I use another layer over built in web server in Tornado?"

```df.loc[:,'Epoch'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Datetime'])```
But I get this error:
```TypeError: Unrecognized value type: &lt;class 'str'&gt;```
Does anyone how may I resolve this issue?"

That _is_ strange"
1745,1513368030.000168,Adan,Is it possible that the web server is overloaded to accept any other incomming connections so it just drops them before they actually logged?
1745,1513368751.000438,Suellen,"Well, it's possible, but I'm not sure. Tornado is a top-notch framework, but it depends"

1754,1513469351.000018,Corrinne,I see
1754,1513469378.000074,Myong,It only becomes an issue if the item is in the format like `[h]1070 gtx[w]...`
1754,1513469379.000017,Corrinne,But there's no kind of validation; Still think there's a way with regex to filter it
1754,1513469416.000088,Myong,"Yeah; I can always just grab the item the person wants; and see if the starting point of the string is between the start of the want and have tag; that might be easier; Lol; Instead of splitting it up; But then I have to check if the string occurs both before and after, but in that case it doesn't matter I can just grab the first occurence"

1754,1513469708.000037,Myong,Yeah the only thing is the spaces
1754,1513469873.000024,Corrinne,does the [h] mean payment method right?
1754,1513469894.000072,Myong,It differentiates between have and want
1754,1513469912.000049,Corrinne,"they all seem to be formatted like `[h]paypal`; or in this case `[H] Paypal, Local Cash [W] Used 1080/1080Ti`; This should take care of any white spaces..; ```import re

1756,1513471292.000033,Myong,Thank you; Getting a `Runtime Error: dictionary changed size during iteration`; Basically iterating through the dictionary and popping off keys that dont pass a certain `if` statement; I tried to create a temp dict but didnt work; I made a list comprehension that does the same thing; lets see if it works; Got it to work
1756,1513472207.000063,Corrinne,Rather than pop as you iterate

1756,1513472298.000098,Myong,One thing I still haven't figured out about list comprehensions and such is when to use if at the end or before the `for` portion.
1756,1513472401.000074,Corrinne,Think you always use it after for as its a conditional statement; But i could be wrong; I know you can get pretty complex with some of these comprehensions
1756,1513472468.00002,Myong,Yeah I did one earlier that nearly took two lines lol
1756,1513472474.00011,Corrinne,haha
1756,1513472478.000049,Myong,They're satisfying when you get them right; I remember my professor gave extra points when I first really got into python for doing list comps so that's all I ever did
1756,1513472505.000072,Corrinne,Yeah totally; They can really condense a lot of code into a nice one liner

1) I forked, and a new ""forked master"" (as you called it) was created.
2) I made changes and committed to MY forked master (my fork; my local copy).

4) My changes were implemented on the original master.
5) Others made numerous changes to original master.
6) I want to make a new contribution so I want to sync my local copy with original project master.

1769,1513616603.000467,Suellen,"well I guess you can; StringIO or something like that, which is a ""file"", but in memory"

1773,1513629145.000169,Fabian,"i was wondering how it returned a list, because we enclosed it in a list?"
1773,1513629173.000373,Myong,".split just splits the string up, and each actual charcter in the string is placed into the list; so if I did `""my name is kbman"".split("" "")` I'd get `[""my"", ""name"", ""is"", ""kbman""]` back"

1787,1513721842.000254,Dimple,<@Fabian> I saw this post but is there a way to do it without use ```del``` or ```remove()``` instructions ?
1787,1513721902.00063,Fabian,I think the way you used it should work? let me open up a console; yep
1787,1513722009.000445,Dimple,<@Fabian> it doesn't work (the way I used). This works on c++.
1787,1513722025.000149,Fabian,"i just got it to work on the console; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):

1787,1513723081.000147,Dimple,<@Fabian> the output should be this (c++ on left): <https://i.imgur.com/BXmUZIo.png>; ops. right
1787,1513723112.000452,Fabian,ahh then you need to do something different in python
1787,1513723166.000404,Dimple,yep.. I will do a while loop. :slightly_smiling_face:
1787,1513723174.00054,Fabian,there you go
1787,1513724020.000149,Dimple,"<@Fabian> I found a way to do it with the same way of c++:
```
myList = iter(range(10))
for i in myList:
    if i == 1:
        myList.__next__()
        myList.__next__()

`output: 1456789`; a little ugly but works."
1787,1513724072.000232,Fabian,yeah i don't even know c++ so thats over my head lol
1788,1513725611.000179,Seema,"is there such a thing as an API schema query, I know API are (loosely) convention based.  Is there some common query to return the schema?"
1788,1513725646.000357,Frieda,"that's what swagger and the like are for, right?"
1788,1513725658.000346,Seema,"okay, I'll go check it out; <@Frieda> I'm thinking on the opposite side, as the consumer, is there a way to ask Swagger, can I see your schema?"
1788,1513725721.000022,Frieda,i could be completely wrong re: swagger; <@Seema> i really doubt there's a standard for that. a lot of people try to hide their API
1788,1513725763.000088,Seema,"or in my case, hey government body with public API, your documentation is meh, just show me your structure"
1788,1513725857.000259,Frieda,it'd be awesome if you could do `/api/schema.json` and get a map of the api
1788,1513725868.000109,Seema,yes! exactly
1788,1513726009.000052,Frieda,"yeah, i don't think that exists; but i'd happily sign a petition"

1788,1513726295.000411,Fabian,just bumping this again now that there's more activity
1788,1513726432.000339,Seema,"which variables and in what manner do you want to use them?; I'm a bit confused about the ingestion, the instr.txt gets opened and read once, correct?  If so, your `while line:` is indented -&gt; performed under the open().  Is that intended for some reason...???"
1788,1513727005.000031,Fabian,"I dont think so, it's the variables at the bottom"
1788,1513727515.000245,Seema,"use a list accumulator, close out the while loop and then you can iterate through the accumulator.  Or you'd really rather skip the iterator, you can straight assign the values manually; then you could go with lines[0], lines[1], it's not the most pythonic way but it'll get you there; go ahead and ask the room, I may be returning a gift that I forgot to return earlier today (doh!)"
1788,1513727928.000297,Corrinne,"During the while loop, you're re-assigning the same variable several times without doing anything to them; Might be worth reading the document in. iterating over the lines using a for loop as <@Seema> suggested and making lists of items you need"
1788,1513728092.000041,Fabian,"thank you guys, ill try screwing with it once I get pycharm to start up; oh i included that in the post; its at the bottom"
1788,1513728238.000254,Corrinne,Pycharm will undoubtedly start shouting at you haha
1788,1513728245.000304,Fabian,"hahah; i see what you mean, was confused for a sec lol"
1788,1513728282.000117,Corrinne,Ok i see the file sample
1788,1513728332.000154,Fabian,here's a post that goes a little more in depth as to my intent with an example source file <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/183187/crop-multiple-images-from-single-image/183222#183222>
1788,1513728523.000078,Corrinne,Have you tried it by just setting some default values here..
1788,1513728533.00038,Fabian,yeah at the top
1788,1513728533.00039,Corrinne,"```major_columns = int(input(""Number of Pages: ""))

1788,1513728545.000262,Fabian,"ah that was the old code; at the bottom is the newer code, before I was taking user input, its quicker to read a file"
1788,1513728594.000069,Corrinne,"ok, besides taking any user input or reading in from a file, have you tried it with fixed values?"
1788,1513728651.00025,Fabian,yeah once i tried setting all of them to none first at the top
1788,1513728664.000135,Corrinne,Ok and I'm guessing that didnt work
1788,1513728699.000062,Fabian,"nope; would i still use the while loop after?; still getting the same issue it seems when i try this; ```lines = []

1788,1513729406.000223,Frieda,which effectively means you're splitting something that isn't a string
1788,1513729417.000083,Fabian,ah that means i dont need the split anymore!; interesting
1788,1513729437.0002,Frieda,this is where pdb and logging come in handy
1788,1513729449.000247,Fabian,pdb?; agh

1788,1513730917.000174,Corrinne,That's a shame.. For Treehouse. Although I really like some of their other teachers too
1788,1513731073.000196,Glinda,I could maybe use python subprocess to `curl`?
1788,1513731115.000241,Frieda,<@Glinda> i mean...you could...but i'd probably spend my time figuring out why the other two are blocked. especially `requests`
1788,1513731163.000329,Fabian,"did all the logic look otherwise ok in my code? specifically the loop at the bottom? getting some funny results, math isnt my strong suit"
1788,1513731165.000014,Frieda,"yeah, so far, so good; <@Fabian> honestly not sure what you were trying to accomplish so i just cut that part. explain, in english, what you're looking to do?"
1788,1513731226.000032,Fabian,"ah ok give me one sec, its a little complex, or at least I think"
1788,1513731274.00002,Frieda,"(that's why i said ""in english"" :smile: )"
1788,1513731296.000078,Fabian,that makes sense
1788,1513731316.000049,Frieda,gotta get out of that code mindset
1788,1513731448.00026,Corrinne,"<@Frieda> I know this is an open ended question, but what was the most effective way for you to learn Python / Development?"
1788,1513731471.000036,Frieda,"uh. i built things; i mean, where do you want me to start? when i first learned any sort of ""coding""?; or learning python specifically?"
1788,1513731495.000195,Corrinne,Ok that was the answer I was hoping for / expecting
1788,1513731504.000366,Frieda,or how i learn stuff now?
1788,1513731524.000205,Fabian,"Ok so have to use a little code, what im trying to determine, is what exactly this is doing, `y = h * row + start_y + major_rows_h * row_m` ive been trying to get the right measurements  using gimp,, and i believe im manipluating the height between the major rows here, and my estimates are way off, so im not sure if this is doing what i think it's doing"
1788,1513731583.000148,Frieda,"so, i'm old. i learned BASIC in elementary and middle school. then taught myself HTML on a computer that wasn't connected to the WWW (_HTML For Dummies_ shoutout) and i snuck floppy disks into the public library to upload my web site to GeoCities; <@Fabian> you understand PEMDAS?"
1788,1513731619.000062,Fabian,Yeah its been a while but yes
1788,1513731620.000136,Frieda,"<@Corrinne> was that a bit earlier than you wanted?; <@Fabian> parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction"
1788,1513731644.000317,Corrinne,No not at all. I find it interesting to known where everyone started their journey; Wish I had started earlier. But I'm only just creeping up to 30 :thinking_face:
1788,1513731700.000319,Frieda,"<@Fabian> so that line multiplies `h` by `row` (I'll call that `x`), then `major_rows_h` by `row_m` (`z`). then it adds `x` to `start_y` and the sum of that to `z` . finally it assigns the sum of that to `y`; <@Corrinne> there's no max age on programming; one of the reasons i went to ORM was because i got interviewed by a recent hire who looked to be in their 50s"
1788,1513731750.000203,Corrinne,"The thing I realised shortly after starting to learn python / Web dev, is that you need to grasp a whole load of other technologies to put it to good use"
1788,1513731772.000356,Frieda,web dev is one of the hardest disciplines because you have to understand so many moving parts
1788,1513731780.000172,Fabian,I think I see

1788,1513731788.000094,Frieda,each part is pretty simple but the cognitive load is no joke
1788,1513731802.000244,Corrinne,Yeah exactly
1788,1513731837.000102,Fabian,ah ok i get it now; thank you again!
1788,1513731850.000155,Frieda,<@Fabian> break it out into multiple steps if you need to
1788,1513731852.000144,Corrinne,It's all time and experience though
1788,1513731853.000011,Frieda,code is cheap; obvious code &gt; clever code

1788,1513731949.000054,Corrinne,Yeh I learnt that quickly when I started out
1788,1513732002.000011,Frieda,"with python, at least, whatever you're wanting to do has probably already been done and put into stdlib; _always_ check the docs"

1788,1513732052.000113,Frieda,i've been looking into learning Go lately and it's hard using a language that doesn't love you

1793,1513762854.000118,Ciera,ssl is a pain in python; what version ?
1793,1513763770.000388,Suellen,betting on 2.7; my bet is 2.7.9
1793,1513763808.000511,Ciera,there are a lot of 2.7 sadly. But it might just be a self signed certificates
1793,1513763836.000457,Suellen,"I remember troubles with normal certs on 2.7, it was related to an old version of system openssl"
1793,1513763864.000289,Ciera,yeah and newer version of TLS are not available I believe; got trouble with the postgresql apt repo with ansible not too long ago due to python2.7
1793,1513763953.000276,Suellen,Why did you change `ovv` to `Ovv`?
1793,1513764060.000146,Ciera,Well names should start with a maj :smile:; and to differentiate with all my test accounts
1793,1513764159.0004,Suellen,:thinking_face:
1793,1513764293.000105,Chaya,"basicaly with all versions I'm getting this error; I have 2.7.13 , 2.6, 3.2, 3.5; I this it's something to do with lib"
1793,1513764350.000021,Ciera,can you share the url ?; are you sure the certs is a valid one ?
1793,1513764379.000041,Chaya,also when I try to pip upgrade I get `certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate`; <@Ciera> url I'm using is in local network
1793,1513764549.000352,Suellen,and if you `wget` it?
1793,1513764594.000022,Chaya,"yep, it's same story"
1793,1513764612.000176,Suellen,thats.. interesting
1793,1513764626.000243,Chaya,`ERROR: The certificate of xxx is not trusted.`; `The certificate has expired `
1793,1513764630.000034,Ciera,probably something with the openssl installed and the certificates
1793,1513764633.000154,Suellen,well there you have it!
1793,1513764641.000058,Ciera,ah well it's something else :smile:
1793,1513764652.000052,Suellen,good old expiration
1793,1513764677.000138,Chaya,but why then pip also shows ssl erros?
1793,1513764688.000536,Ciera,proxy ?
1793,1513764700.000399,Chaya,hmm...; not sure
1793,1513764715.000276,Suellen,Try `pip -vvv [command]`; it's probably gonna spill a lot more details; if your network does something like mitm it's gonna be funny :|

1793,1513770661.000251,Chaya,kind'a stupid mistake
1794,1513776494.000178,Mariano,Any way to revert a git command?. I just did a git rebase --abort and it rolled back a lot of my work. (i never ended a rebase that i started without noticing)
1794,1513776602.000164,Ciera,you can use `git reflog` to find a commit to go back to I think
1794,1513776629.000374,Mariano,Ok. Crossing my fingers here; yeah i fuckup; today's a sad day
1794,1513776881.000152,Ciera,arg :confused:
1794,1513778015.00007,Lachelle,<@Mariano> if the changes were ever staged you might find them with `git fsck --lost-found`
1795,1513780657.000401,Gaynelle,hello
1795,1513780683.000095,Afton,hi
1795,1513781952.000141,Bella,"Could someone to explain me, why we need to use `generators`, and for which reasons?"
1795,1513782079.000468,Ciera,<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1twn9kLmYg> if you have 4 hours to spare :smile:
1795,1513782586.000406,Bella,"<@Ciera> thanks, for the video! but could you explain in two words, why need to use generatos? sometimes, I’m a little bit confused."
1795,1513782632.000322,Ciera,"the goal are to win memory and sometime time; ```
for x in [1,2,3,4,5]:
  if x == 2:
    break
```; For example in this loop it will exit on the second item; so there isn't really a need to create a list with 5 item. If I have something that can give the item one by one I will win a bif of memory; ```
def give_items():
  result = []
  for x in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     results.append(x)
  return results

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break

def give_items():
  for y in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     yield y

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break
```; In this case it will be faster because once `give_items` yield 2 I can continue; does that make sense <@Bella> ?"
1795,1513783094.000669,Bella,<@Ciera> Yes! thanks for the explanation! and main goal of generatos it’s save time?
1795,1513783132.000262,Ciera,mainly memory (I didn't really illustrate that here but imagine if the list is 1 million item long); it can save time but if you need to complete the loop if will take the same time
1795,1513783194.000055,Bella,"<@Ciera> Okay, got it! thanks;)"
1795,1513783205.000176,Ciera,:thumbsup:; The video is really worth watching (as all :dabeaz: videos). Maybe not everything but just the beginning if you don't have the time
1795,1513783462.000706,Bella,"<@Ciera> Yeah, David Beazley discuss about generators and etc a lot:slightly_smiling_face:"
1795,1513784092.000635,Ciera,"the cleanest way would be to use the `multiprocessing` module, but then you don't launch a file; otherwise `subprocess.Popen()` with `python path/to/script.py`"
1795,1513784485.000052,Winnifred,"hm, I like <@Ciera>'s approach. I personally use `subprocess.run()`."
1795,1513784535.000612,Ciera,"<@Russ> what database are you using ? some db have full text search; does this works ? `python -c ""print('hello world')""`; <@Russ> I'm not familliar with mysql, you might have better luck in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or <#C3X4T24LB|databases> :slightly_smiling_face:; Not sure what happens when you use `&gt;=` with two strings"
1796,1513783940.000186,Elsie,"What's the best way to run a separate python file as a subprocess?; When I use Popen its opening a python repl in my terminal that I launch the main script from...; Well oddly enough when I run it on windows it runs as expected, however on linux it's opening the python repl in the terminal; subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, basepath+""/DeviceSocket.py""], shell=True)"
1796,1513784278.000587,Winnifred,what does your python script do? does it require input?
1796,1513784349.000273,Russ,"Currently have a Django list table view for books (w/ filters - book title, author, etc.). Books has a `foreign key` to comments, but comments has a `generic foreign key` to books (or anything else you could leave a comment on, like movies). 

*How could I go about having a free form text based search on a field pointed to a generic foreign key?* For instance, a text filter for searching (filtering) through the comment list view column."
1796,1513784360.000017,Elsie,"Just needs to run the 'DeviceSocket' script as a subprocess, and continue on with the code block below the subprocess call in the main script; However when I run my main script in the terminal when it gets to the Popen line for that subprocess it opens a python repl in the terminal as if i had typed in ""python3""; This problem only occurs when I got from windows to linux; in windows it continues on with the code block below the subprocess.Popen; Yeah unfortunately I'm restricted to using subprocess, the rest of the application is too tightly coupled to implement multithreading; Could it be that I don't have the file marked as an executable on my linux setup?"
1796,1513784645.000261,Suellen,"no, you don't execute it anyway; you point Python to it"
1796,1513784723.000423,Ciera,as a subpocess
1796,1513784729.000193,Winnifred,"what is the call you are using, <@Elsie>? Can you show us some code?"
1796,1513784745.000413,Russ,"<@Ciera> I am utilizing MySQL, however, I am not sure how to have this Book list view be filtered by the comments - given that there is the generic foreign key from comments to Books."
1796,1513784864.000042,Elsie,"Where basepath is the path in which my main script and ""DeviceSocket.py"" are located; <@Ciera> using Popen?"
1796,1513785145.000394,Winnifred,"yeah, my guess is it's not finding your script"
1796,1513785171.000418,Ciera,it should throw an error and not enter the repl in that case
1796,1513785191.000413,Winnifred,hm okay
1796,1513785206.00069,Ciera,well at least on my system it does.
1796,1513785228.000008,Elsie,"And just to reiterate, it does not enter the repl on win7; python 3.4.3"
1796,1513785265.000547,Ciera,are you 100% sure it's the same script ?
1796,1513785273.00023,Elsie,100%; Copied everything over and tried running it
1796,1513785329.000932,Winnifred,"can you run this from the directory where the script lives? so something like `[sys.executable, 'DeviceSocket.py']`?"
1796,1513785358.000229,Elsie,<@Winnifred> in the repl?
1796,1513785470.000105,Winnifred,Scratch this. I just tested my hypothesis locally.
1796,1513785496.000756,Elsie,<@Winnifred> same behavior when run it in the repl
1796,1513785505.000478,Ciera,are you sure it's what you want ? what do you want to check ?
1796,1513785525.000113,Ashlea,I want to make sure that the length of node.text is higher than the length of target.
1796,1513785536.000419,Ciera,<@Elsie> do you get any output on `stderr` or `stdout` ?
1796,1513785538.000375,Ashlea,Or equal.
1796,1513785558.000129,Ciera,you should use `len(my_string)` I believe
1796,1513785583.000549,Elsie,<@Ciera> How should I check that?
1796,1513785597.000038,Ashlea,"That throws the same error. Also, pylint states that you may not use len as a conditional value."
1796,1513785634.000107,Ciera,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'aaa'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 'b'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a &gt; b
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; a &lt; b

1796,1513785760.000089,Ashlea,<@Ciera> So the only way to go about this is using len(string)?
1796,1513785773.000153,Winnifred,"<@Elsie>, additionally, check out: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/43276598/3046539>"

1796,1513785833.000078,Winnifred,"instead of `shell=True`, you can do `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and then poll to see if it is completed unless you need some output from subprocess."
1796,1513785848.000273,Antionette,<@Ashlea> What is `target`?
1796,1513785869.000611,Ashlea,Target is an argument that the function expects. It's a string.
1796,1513785911.000791,Ciera,you sure ? can you print it ?

1797,1513785993.000014,Antionette,Can you post the stack trace?; Can you post the full function?; and throws the error? Couldn't that be beacuse that evaluates to false and then it continues to the `elif (node.items() is not None) and (len(node.items())) and isdeepsearch:` line where the error occurs?; So none of your if/elif statements are evaluating to true for some reason

Split the list into n equal parts where n = num of workers

1798,1513795135.000193,Winnifred,"^^ same thing I was thinking; can you operate on each list in the ""master"" list?"
1798,1513795195.000008,Myong,What do you mean; I can access and take values then modify them and return a different list; then `del()` the old one to save memory

1798,1513795324.000132,Winnifred,"if so, each process/thread can work on each list and modify them in place (I think)."
1798,1513795365.000399,Myong,"Technically it's not in that format; when I get it; Cause atm I basically run requests that pull a .csv from online and save into a list of lists where each internal list is a row in the .csv, however I do this ~9 times so I have a list of 9 lists with thousands of other lists within; So it's sort of setup already, however I don't want to just send those lists in cause one might be 5k items and another might be 500; I flatten the masterlist from `[ [ [ ], [ ] ], [ [ ], [ ] ] ]` -&gt; `[ [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ] ]`; But at that points its one main list of thousands of entries, and I need to split it up evenly so I may just do something like"

1798,1513795892.000746,Winnifred,"I would go about it the same way. To get stuff done, I’d try without distributing work and then optimize like you’re doing. "
1798,1513795923.000027,Myong,Good point

1799,1513798540.000498,Collette,It really depends on what your worker function does
1799,1513798565.000457,Myong,"Sounds good. The worker function checks at a certain index in a list if it exists, then have some Regex that grabs a piece of it"

1800,1513806266.000337,Mara,"Hi everyone, I was wondering, is there a good place to find help for locust related scripts?"
1801,1513807574.000106,Bruno,"what do you guys like for a minimal queuing system? I am not sure if we need the ""distributed"" nature of something like celery yet. But if its an easy setup it could be fine. I also saw RQ as well. I am going to try a minimal example setup for processing some work in python through a queue and using docker. we are trying to rewrite a portion of our stack from node."
1801,1513807805.000076,Johana,i used python-rq for a long time but after learning celery i probably would have just used celery.; the Python Cookbook has some really good examples too.; if you want something minimal.
1801,1513807881.000174,Bruno,"ok cool. so celery is easy to get setup? ill have to check out the cookbook; does celery need redis? using docker, would it need to talk with a redis container for storage?"
1801,1513808724.000233,Callie,"I was curious about the function return type annotations. My Python book used them throughout but I almost never seen it in real code, is it some thing that is generally ignored?"
1801,1513808749.000293,Johana,celery needs some kind of broker.; you can use redis or rabbitmq.
1801,1513808938.00012,Bruno,oh i was thinking rabbitmq was synonymous with celery
1801,1513808984.000008,Johana,"nope, it’s a broker. they are often used together so probably why you thought that."
1801,1513808998.00015,Bruno,ah
1801,1513809015.000087,Johana,when you instantiate celery you pass the connection string to the broker.
1801,1513809047.000002,Bruno,"hmm. in node theres a library called `kue` which is nice since we just import it, and it talks to redis directly to handle the queue.; ah ok."
1801,1513809146.00002,Johana,this is my celery config. some of the tasks are loading the database with data as others are computing student mastery of topics and other things. <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/celery.py>; aside from that you add a task decorator to whatever functions you want to execute async and that’s about it.; oh and you have to make sure to run your celery workers process and then run your celery beat process; if you want to use celery-beat
1801,1513809453.000248,Bruno,"when using the decorator, it puts the funtion into the queue based on when it does I/O ?; or just when the function is called"
1801,1513809507.000229,Johana,"the latter, wherever you decide to use it in code you will have `.delay()` method.; my_async_function.delay()"
1801,1513809528.000027,Bruno,"oh wait, with the config. i think i see. so the config is basically scheduling these ""loaders"" to run at given intervals?"
1801,1513809539.000179,Johana,"yep, that part is using celery-beat."
1801,1513809541.000511,Bruno,ah ok.
1801,1513809555.000093,Johana,if you’re not running anything on a schedule you can ignore all that.
1801,1513809559.000408,Bruno,ok. so thats more like running it as a cron setup?
1801,1513809585.000247,Johana,"yea, you can use cron syntax or some others iirc."
1801,1513809604.000309,Bruno,"well, thats interesting. part of this is running on a cron like setup. but that, is processing some data and when work needs to be done, we want to send that to another queue so workers can process it.; currently this is all in one shitty service and managed through a Thread.js file and is messy. so were going to rebuild it and looking at using node or python. im pushing for python."
1801,1513809704.000201,Johana,sounds like it would be achievable in celery.
1801,1513809716.000101,Bruno,"so the ""thread"" is run and looks to see if anything needs to be processed. if it does, it preps it, then starts up to 10 threads to do the work.; those threads doing the work, we just want as workers to monitor a queue to see when work needs to be done."
1801,1513809789.000482,Johana,"yea, that’s why we have the different queues. you can create different ones for different workers.. you can add priority and other things."
1801,1513809820.000482,Bruno,ok cool. so why did you switch from RQ to celery?
1801,1513809854.000432,Johana,we use celery in a lot of our other apps so it was to remain consistent.; i was the outlier using RQ.
1801,1513809887.00003,Bruno,ah. are there benefits to using RQ?
1801,1513809910.000423,Johana,it’s “simpler”.
1801,1513809940.000123,Bruno,would it do what I need in your opinion based on what I described?
1801,1513809947.000257,Johana,celery is often touted as having a large learning curve. that’s why i avoided it. but after working with it it isn’t all that bad.
1801,1513809961.000379,Bruno,ok
1801,1513809984.000106,Johana,"yea, i don’t see why not. you may need to do a quick spike to see what you like best."
1801,1513809995.000171,Bruno,"yea.; so how is celery ""distributed"" ? looking at their page.; so you can have multiple instances replicating each others queues?; mostly, the threads that run and to the processes are long running and take time."
1801,1513810085.000211,Johana,the workers are distributing the work and you can distribute the workers among any number of machines. they all know how to talk to each other b/c of the broker.
1801,1513810095.000213,Bruno,a larger process takes about 10 minutes. some times more. it takes about 10 hours to run them for all clients. and its done daily; ah ok. you cant do that with RQ?; or as easily?
1801,1513810137.000347,Johana,not sure really. i haven’t used RQ to that capacity but i would assume so b/c all the workers need is a copy of the source code they can access.; the same goes for celery
1801,1513810224.000266,Bruno,yea. that was my thought; i just spin up workers based on need or load. and they have thecode. and just look to see what work needs to be done.
1801,1513810258.000166,Johana,as long as they can all talk to the same broker it should work.
1801,1513810277.00007,Bruno,what about failover. if the queue container breaks or fails. how is that handled?; ok.
1801,1513810298.000015,Johana,you get a bunch of rabbitmq errors.
1801,1513810301.000013,Bruno,"ah, or i suppose what if the broker fails.; ok.; we want to prevent lost jobs; well, we have to"
1801,1513810327.000408,Johana,you can have celery retry a task a number of times.; if it keeps failing you can setup a dead-mailbox or something like that.; you can also have celery send an email.
1801,1513810364.00001,Bruno,"well, i mean if celery goes down. or, in this case, redis since its the backend store; hmm; i suppose if it goes down, we can re-run the main worker to rebuild the queue."
1801,1513810433.000373,Johana,o wait n/m dead-letter queue is rabbitmq specific.
1801,1513810444.00012,Bruno,its a finite amount of work (that would get larger as we get more users) but its that they are long running.
1801,1513810509.000334,Johana,"i got you. celery has what are known as signatures, chains, and groups, you can use these to execute your tasks in particular ways.; a chain for example will execute tasks in order and only when the first one completes."
1801,1513810562.000125,Bruno,ok. thats nice.
1801,1513810602.00043,Johana,for monitoring: <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html>; flower is pretty sweet.
1801,1513810634.00019,Bruno,but what im thinking about. is the storage of the queue. in redis. what if redis goes down. For this case i would assume that the redis data has to be persisted onto a data volume or s3? or something. so if it goes down it can be restarted and get the data back. or we could possibly re-build the queue; ok ill check it out thanks.
1801,1513810665.000059,Johana,"yea, you would need to run a persistent redis."
1801,1513810669.000196,Bruno,i just havent done this much yet for deploying all this.; would it save data to s3 or just a mounted volume or something?
1801,1513810734.0003,Johana,i think redis has its own thing
1801,1513810742.000558,Bruno,were not using docker yet. well we are but only for a small service. im onw of the few that is trying to help and bring docker in by getting small things running in it.; ok.
1801,1513810759.000071,Johana,yea it’s called RDB. <https://redis.io/topics/persistence>
1801,1513810784.000421,Bruno,ok. basically we cant afford to lose data.
1801,1513810802.000586,Johana,"yea, says the RDB can be stored on amazon s3"
1801,1513810822.000037,Bruno,"this is all done every day. so backup would only need to be done for the current or last day.; main thing, is if it fails for whatever reason. when we bring it up we want to continue from where we left off.; &gt; RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage); what we store in redis shouldnt be too large.; ok, i think the AoF part is more what im looking for."
1801,1513811044.000235,Johana,is the current thing not working well?
1801,1513811087.000351,Bruno,"but, it may not be too big of a deal. the list of all work can be built in a couple minutes probably. so if redis goes down. we can probably just rebuild it.; it is working, but its really messy. its basically a small monolith.; its all done in 1 big thread managed in code. and spawns process threads (up to 10) to actually process the work. and its hard to debug. and right now, im debugging a race condition.; so when we have clients thats using this to monitor $1b worth of work reports, we want ti to be stable and easy to work on."
1802,1513817523.000319,Marlon,I have a module with a `def main():` block i’m trying to call this module from another file using the context trick (<https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod/blob/master/tests/context.py>) in my tests folder i’m trying to say module.main() and it’s telling me it’s not callable. any pointers?

1816,1513960481.000166,Meg,are you loading the json response into a dict?
1816,1513960556.000246,Devorah,I believe so I can call current_observation and it pulls all the pairs under that; but I don't know how to call the nested ones
1816,1513960593.000471,Meg,"you have a couple options; execute the api request in a rest client like postman, then inspect the response; or two, implement a recursive dict traversal to print out the keys in the dict; I’d go for the first"
1816,1513960775.000236,Devorah,"what's involved in the first one, never dealt with rest or postman"

1817,1513968460.00009,Seema,"<@Devorah> if you're up for learning, the reading of the errors and parsing a bunch of dicts within a list within a dict is a great way to practice indexing and key/value iteration and searching, on the other hand, this has been solved long ago and if it doesn't interest you, can you skip for now or forever; <@Marco> welcome, if you are going to paste a lot of code, please click the plus on the side of the text bar and input the code there.  The `with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:` block is written to close down the `with` block when the process is complete, you could use a `while True:` block to keep the program alive though that is rough as it does not have a condition for closure."
1817,1514063788.000006,Deedee,"<@Marco> Because the script is already importing `time`, you could just follow same convention that most other camera software use: timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.

Change line
`camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image1.jpg', use_video_port=True)`
To something like
```
datetime_captured = time.strftime(""%Y%m%d%H%M%S"")
camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/' + datetime_captured + '.jpg', use_video_port=True)
```
The above will produce file w/ name like `20171223140944.jpg` in `/home/pi/Desktop/`.

As for having software run until explicitly exiting, something along the lines of what <@Seema> suggested is way to go."
1818,1513981460.000118,Marco,"Hi.  I am brand new to this group, so I hope I am not making any mistakes.  I am not a heavy programmer, but I am trying to help my father with an issue.  He is working on a camera built with a Raspberry Pi and Python for taking picture of a retina. The problem is that the code he has always saves the picture with the same name.  Thus, if you take a picture, it writes over the previous picture.  It should instead save each picture with a new name.  Also, at the end the script shuts down the camera, rather than letting you take multiple pictures without restarting the program.  Below is the code.  How can I change it to fix these problems?  If I should post this somewhere else, please let me know.  Thanks.

1830,1514290962.000087,Bette,Python <http://tutor.com|tutor.com>; I got your point regarding variable rule
1830,1514291002.000108,Junita,yeah perhaps they are doing something weird with the variables before passing them to an underlying interpreter.
1830,1514291003.000039,Bette,Do you know about python any method; I'm scartaching my head to understand it
1830,1514291031.00011,Junita,"yes, essentially it ensures that at least one value in an iterable evaluates to `True`; a related method is `all`, which assures that all values evaluate to `True`"
1830,1514291134.000117,Bette,"Yeah. Read it but in the example; The output is 
True false true false; I'm wondering how"

    return False

1830,1514291251.000026,Junita,"the reason is python has a concept of “truthiness” - essentially values like 0, None and False all are roughly equivalent in boolean comparison"
1830,1514291251.000135,Bette,Like how it was true or false
1830,1514291281.000009,Junita,"and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, etc. and of course True are all True"
1830,1514291381.000052,Bette,But in case 1 and 3 0 is there and still return true ?; Because we need atleast one true ?; Am I right ?

1830,1514291912.000034,Junita,that’s always a good idea.  are you by chance going through the list here? <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>

What are the options in my case?"

1862,1514555333.000014,Georgeann,"Hi all.
I have a Dockerfile. I run the command docker build. Then docker run.
My script creates a file, how to make so that it is stored on my PC, because if I the script will run using Docker, it is nowhere to be found."
1862,1514557951.000143,Deedee,<@Georgeann> have you checked for the file inside of the container?
1862,1514558159.000136,Elma,after you've checked if the file exists inside of the container you should use docker-compose 'volumes' <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes>
1862,1514558378.000087,Deedee,"Agreed.
But also depends on what no-name wants to do. I didn't get much other than script creates a file that can't be found. Apparently should be written in host OS."
1862,1514559069.000042,Elma,mmm you're right.
1862,1514560259.000213,Georgeann,"<@Elma> <@Deedee> Look.
I have a pythonscript for example look like
```f = open('some.txt', 'w')
f.wrtite('Test')
f.close()
```
and i build docker, like
```$ docker build -t test/test1 .
```
then
```
$ docker run --rm idonotknowwhat
```
And what should I add to start to the file to appear in the same folder where I run the script?"
1862,1514560854.00027,Elma,To share files between client and container you can create volumes; You should take a look on this <http://jdlm.info/articles/2016/03/06/lessons-building-node-app-docker.html#the-nodemodules-volume-trick>; or check in the official documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#choose-the--v-or-mount-flag>

1863,1514564680.000068,Glinda,"<@Johnsie> Best practice: anything that needs to be unique among instances needs to be in `__init__` or an instance variable anything that needs to be shared among instances needs to be a class variable. Code to the behavior here, don't code to the variable type."
1863,1514567049.000174,Johnsie,"<@Glinda>, ok thanks. You last phrase make senses a lot. ""Code to the behavior""."
1863,1514569576.000169,Glinda,"What is this behavior called: ```from src.modules import Module

# Instance the class and save a variable in this package. 
Module(important_variable)

# classmethod, that can reference 'important_variable'

ModuleHelper.function('some string')```; That sounds right.; How bad of an idea is this: ```token = None

1863,1514570247.000147,Glinda,"I have a few classes in this module, all of them need access to this token.; I want to make the module as much like a package as I can; where you have to pass in a token instead of looking for one in the local area or define it within the package."
1863,1514570380.000145,Ciera,"you can create a variable inside a package; ```

I've read so many posts/responses/articles... even watched 2 hrs worth of vids on LinuxAcademy on Git that things like <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing> may as well be written as hieroglyphs.
What I need to do is replace my local repo w/ the most recent upstream. So sync my local copy so that it is exactly as the latest upstream/master copy.
fetch, rebase, pull, merge, sorcery, it all just produces errors. 
```
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0001 Rewording of copy on invite request form
The copy of the patch that failed is found in: .git/rebase-apply/patch

When you have resolved this problem, run ""git rebase --continue"".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run ""git rebase --skip"" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run ""git rebase --abort"".
```

I ask because I have things such as test_update_user that needs me to

- Setup a test user in the database via `post(/api/user, data=new_user_data)`
- Perform test on user update via `put(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;, data=updated_user_data) `
- Teardown the test user via `delete(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;)`

I don't really know how to consolidate the Setup and Teardown aspects of this into a fixture."

1870,1514693223.000005,Ute,"Hello. I'm new to python and am a bit puzzled about using virtualenv and was wondering what the current best practices are surrounding that, especially for beginners"
1870,1514694168.000067,Seema,"<@Sherley> I'm being a *bit* simplistic but the norm is virtualenv for everything.  If you use more than one version of Python, it becomes very handy, especially when you start using the switches/options."
1870,1514694275.000002,Ute,<@Seema> has virtualenv been phased out in favor of docker?
1870,1514694300.000017,Collette,"<@Sherley> I'd say start with `pipenv`. It has its quirks, but for an end-user it works better than just plain virtualenv"
1870,1514694301.000004,Ute,Or is it still accepted to use virtualenv
1870,1514694310.000051,Collette,docker is a whole different story
1870,1514694347.000039,Seema,"Depending on your philosophy and desires, you can use both together or just a virtualenv.  They are not the same though can accomplish similar tasks"
1870,1514694356.00003,Ute,"From what I understand, the point of virtualenv is to keep each project and its dependencies isolated; Which incidentally also coincides with my understanding of docker's purpose.. Or at least its central one"
1870,1514694623.000062,Seema,"Docker creates composable environments while virtualenv creates a virtual environment, installing to a virtualenv is isolated from the system but available after deactivation.  Docker images are created, calling the same image next time will create the original environment; There are other advantages and disadvantages.  Are you developing for yourself?; The pros often come down to how you want to manage dependencies, system files, and whether you are sharing the environment.  Virtualenv really does take care of the majority of the issues in a simpler fashion; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe>"
1870,1514695713.000027,Ute,<@Seema> The project that I was interested in is an open source project I found on GitHub
1870,1514695778.000045,Seema,"The project will typically have a lead either by including a docker file or a requirements. Txt or possibly even both; I would follow the project in that case, ymmv"
1870,1514696082.000007,Ute,"Ok. It recommends virtualenv but is missing explicit directions on how to use it in the readme, <http://GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art|GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art>"
1870,1514696455.000009,Seema,"Like Malinoff said, you can use other virtualenv, either way, you'll create an environment, clone the repo, then pip install -r requirements.txt; The command will change depending on the program of course; (Off for the night, gn, good luck)"
