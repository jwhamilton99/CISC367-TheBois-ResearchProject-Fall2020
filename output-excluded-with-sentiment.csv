0.0	0.861	0.139	0.6652	Is it possible to switch between conda and virtualenv? That is I want to switch the actual environment managers not just environments in them … I typically use conda but want to try something out that requires virtual env and is not compatible with conda.  Thanks.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What is it that "requires virtualenv", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies
	0.149	0.774	0.077	-0.296	<@Beula> zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.; what have you tried so far?
	0.161	0.759	0.08	-0.3075	Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.; Just switch the path/env settings?
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.4215	with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.; so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.; `source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it; are you using python 2 or python 3?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Conda does the same really, so  gives you a conda environment; and then  sets it up; you can use  to check which one you are using
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but i think the issue is with the library <@Hillary>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>
	0.198	0.802	0.0	-0.6059	3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.7783	but as <@Johana> said, probably best to not try and mix them up; Oh, hadn't seen zappa before
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when you do `which python` what comes up?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Normally the conda one.
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.4767	that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.
	0.0	0.581	0.419	0.7351	when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ; if that helps
	0.0	0.152	0.848	0.6808	Yes, thanks <@Hillary>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then follow <@Johana> advice on activating
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.7845	Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.

	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.1154	I don't know what conversation but I can make <@Alesia> say what I want
	0.2	0.686	0.114	-0.3612	Oh, alright. So you can't see our convo?; Alright.; Not that I say anything bad.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if <@Alesia> is in a channel (public or private) we could snoop with the logs. In private messages <@Alesia> doesn't see them, only when you use `/` commands
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	slackline is also listening to stuff but only on general
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hey guys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hey buddy
	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.5499	I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied; any tips?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	compileall?
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh
	0.129	0.871	0.0	-0.4767	I also removed the previous .pyc file; before recompiling; apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues
	0.0	0.752	0.248	0.6808	help is a good channel to ask in n/w.; did you install your package with `-e`?; `pip install -e "path/to/package"`
	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	<@Johana> no; just `pip install mypackage`
	0.0	0.94	0.06	0.2732	that would be your issue; -e allows it to be editable; it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm; so I need to reinstall it
	0.0	0.733	0.267	0.6249	you can install it again on top (i think).; but it’s probably safer to uninstall first
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.2263	okay; `mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it local?
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.296	no
	0.0	0.945	0.055	0.5267	hmmm.. this package is on pypi?; you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.; for example lets say this is my project dir.  ; these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`; i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.; then type `pip install -e "../requests"`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	virtualenv?; uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
	0.03	0.859	0.111	0.7269	yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.; if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does `pip install` look for any particular file?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
	0.0	0.423	0.577	0.6249	great; I think I got this
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hey it worked!
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.2023	the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.4199	it actually really works!; this is going to be my first pull request; thank you so much <@Johana>
	0.0	0.244	0.756	0.8519	that’s fantastic. i’m glad i could help.
	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.4767	Does anyone have a pro tip for freeing up disk space on a SSD?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	links
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`rm -rf /`
	0.0	0.693	0.307	0.4767	BleachBit; and ZFS; (compression is freeing space, right?)
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.6652	Depends on what OS, but on mac there is a diskutility thing that is used to erase free space, I have seen that reclaim a bit. Also cleaning up a docker cache, if you use docker
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.0772	I want to use setattr inside a class’s init method. Should I use it on `self` or `self.__dict__` ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Reda>  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Natividad> are you running it in a virtual env?
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.7618	whats the use case?; you could, but changes wouldn't be replicated; and trying to keep changes in sync between the excel program and the python program would be a headache; so, I'd say this is something that you could do in theory, but I'd not bother
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.6249	<@Staci>, I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg>, my thoughts exactly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or office 365; those already have collaboration built into them; why re-invent the wheel; and end up handing the client a 10K bill for development time
	0.0	0.578	0.422	0.9211	haha; <@Staci>, if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>
	0.086	0.681	0.233	0.6249	Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents.; And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents; But that's crazy of course.
	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.25	Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document.
	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.7184	<@Staci> I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.
	0.087	0.698	0.215	0.7684	yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python; it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(
	0.034	0.767	0.199	0.8689	<@Winnifred> not exactly.  xlsxwriter is only for creating and writing to excel files.  It can't open and read from existing files; right there at the top of the FAQ <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/faq.html>; &gt;&gt;&gt;Can XlsxWriter use an existing Excel file as a template? No.  XlsxWriter is designed only as a file writer. It cannot read or modify an existing Excel file.
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.2023	how do I get an elastic IP to my ec2 instance? the instance is already running and when I click on it’s description. It’s empty
	0.058	0.909	0.033	-0.5346	before a user account can be created in my app it checks whether someone with the same username exists, and then whether someone with the same email has already registered, as both of these are supposed to be unique. Do I really need to check these individually? I know the insert query will fail if the values aren't unique since the columns are set to `unique`, but is there a way to know _which_ one caused the error, so that for example I can tell the user whether their username is taken or whether their email address is already registered.
	0.095	0.822	0.082	-0.1513	<@Thomasina> your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Hermina> Hi. How about this snippet: 
	0.0	0.627	0.373	0.8442	<@Meg> yep, agreed. I mentioned open and edit wasn’t possible in my first comment (at least with the popular python excel libs).

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hey <@Beula> thnx for your response, apparently mysql-connector doesn't work on 3.6
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Follow this: <http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>; where it says: export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7; use this command: export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.5; then activate the virtual enviroment with source my_project/bin/activate
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.3612	Did you try it <@Corrine> or is that just what the docs say. There isn't any reason it shouldn't unless they depend on dicts being unordered or something like that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeap I’ve tried it
	0.0	0.942	0.058	0.0772	(Note that you can change the name "my_project" to anything else you want to write as the name of your virtual enviroment)
	0.066	0.878	0.056	-0.1027	What's the error? In any case, <@Deann> 's solution should work if you have python 3.5 installed ; I'd probably use `which python3.5` so it grabs which is in your path (for example on osx it's probably at /usr/local/bin

	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.5574	Regarding Python Classes. How do we create classes (along with inheritance) to be able to do something like, Class().Function(data).toJSON  toJSON being a @property function.  So really I'm looking to take the return of Class().Function(data) and pass it to the toJSON property to format the data.  Anyone have an idea?
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	<@Rolf> did you mean like chaining methods?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yes.; I've looked into @property methods @staticmethods; Just can't figure it out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`@staticmethod` just means a function doesn't require an instance of itself to operate on; the key to chaining methods is that you have to return a copy of `self` on chainable methods
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What do you mean
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	; something like that would have basic chainable class init and `Function` methods
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Awesome!; I didn't try that ... why didn't I try that?; Hmm this didn't work.  ; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	your `return x` needs to be `return self`; because `return x` is just returning the result of `var1 + var2`, which is just an int
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ahh, so `_x` in that scope doesn't exist; that will need to be `self._x = var1 + var2`
	0.05	0.536	0.414	0.9543	Wow .. ok .. that one I knew .. just too focused on other things ..; Just completely missed it like a noob.; yup .. perfect .. thanks man.; Returning the self was what I was missing.; thanks
	0.232	0.677	0.092	-0.4389	no problem!; its okay, method chaining is a bit of an odd thing to work out at first

	0.223	0.711	0.066	-0.4767	I have a file( test.txt ) which contains a no. and i want to store that no. in a variable; new to python
	0.19	0.634	0.176	-0.0516	<@Jessie> Can you declare your problem a bit? Like given a little example.
	0.028	0.824	0.148	0.7657	<@Jessie> this sounds like you have quite a basic problem (opening and reading a file, finding the right value and storing it); But considering you are new to the language it is probably worth you doing an online tutorial to learn more about python. We could try and help you but there will  likely be more questions and you would be better served by a more formal resource.
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.5859	actually i want to write a script that mail me if root partition is motr than 90% in use...i am fetching that percentage using awk and then appending it to a file and i want to read that file and save that percentage in a variable.. so that i can do if elase on that
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.8537	hi. what is the most pythonic/efficient way to check for 2 conditions as in:  i have 3 string-templates `template1 = 'Main'`  `template2 = 'Other'` `template3 = 'Final'`   - if `template1` is `Main` and its length &lt; 10, take `template1`, otherwise take `template2` and check its length and if thats too long, take `template3` (each string can be dynamic, so that sometimes `Main` is shorter and sometimes the last. but it should always start by checking `Main`); (it should be easy for the experts out there but i cant seem to get my head around it - ideally without a `Class` or `lambda` function)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	length &lt; 10?; if it's main, then its length is 4, right?
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah; ; how about that; change appropriately
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	thanks <@Suellen>. however i quite dont understand how the other templates are used here in their order. maybe very beginner question
	0.074	0.926	0.0	-0.4019	`for template in args` -- loop over all passed arguments (in order, as they are positional arguments); return the first found main template, or the first found "len&lt;10" template; otherwise just return the last one
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.836	`os.system` returns 0; i. e. successful result; `os.system` calls a program (or a number of them) that you specify, and they print to the terminal; then `os.system` returns 0, because everything was successful; then you print `DISK_SPACE` and that's your 0.; don't `print DISK_SPACE`; ... I don't understand.
	0.102	0.837	0.061	0.372	what if i dont want to have that 0; i just want to have size of my disk; i can do if else on the basis of DISK_SPACE and this 0 wont interrupt me ????
	0.058	0.874	0.068	0.1027	Why bother writing to a file and then having python read it and email? Unless you are using that file for other usages, it's probably easiest to just call the subprocess from python and email based on your condition.
	0.046	0.875	0.079	0.128	Now i am not printing. I wonder why it's still printing 80 """ import os DISK_SPACE = os.system("df -Th | grep /dev/sda6 | awk '{print $6}' | cut -d'%' -f1")  if DISK_SPACE &gt; 90:     print "warning" else:     print "everything is fine" eccentric@debian:~/Downloads$ python test.py  80 everything is fine """
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because os.system just spawns a bunch of processes with current context; `df` prints to the terminal
	0.0	0.64	0.36	0.5423	actually i just want to save that output to DISK_SIZE variable
	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.3182	please format your code, use backticks on both sides instead of quotes:  ` ``` ` <@Jessie>
	0.474	0.526	0.0	-0.4019	backtics says syntax error
	0.0	0.484	0.516	0.4939	In slack, my friend
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The short of it is this: `os.system` does not capture the stdout from the subprocess - you need to use the `subprocess` module: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor>

	0.052	0.847	0.101	0.4019	If I have an unknown # of properties that come from a JSON document that I want to attach to a Python class and then use that new class for every record moving forward, what's the best way to do that?  I was trying to grasp python class factories and was struggling a bit with it
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.6948	Well, the properties come from json source 1, and the attributes come from json source 2; so I want to just build out my template from source 1 and then loop through the thousands of records in source 2 with the template as my container.; the structure of the json is goofy though so i have to load it and process it separately from the standard .loads().  good times.

	0.104	0.846	0.05	-0.34	Break down your problem into small components, what is the current issue? "Provide a number" suggests to me that you are not looking for "yes"
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	nope; I am looking to see if some number was provided, if not use the full legth of the array
	0.07	0.653	0.276	0.6249	"the array" is pretty vague, I think you need to expand on your issue a bit more; <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>
	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	let me think about this more on my own; thanks <@Beula>
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	Sounds like you are trying to do an if statement
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anyone worked with PyMC?
	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.4754	So, I broke our mysql cluster, how's everyone else's day going?; Apparently a query caused a table to lock and never unlock.
	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.4963	With the data we are working with, it wouldn't surprise me if we ended up doing that.; We have weekly cron jobs that truncate then insert hundreds of thousands of records.; Unfortunately, much of the data we are working with isn't indexed when we get the data.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Dang, that is a bit of data.
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.2263	Would be nice to index it, but then those bulk inserts become insert or updates and would likely take a long time.
	0.258	0.412	0.33	0.1779	Was the fix pretty difficult today?
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	Don't think he has it fixed yet. Thankfully, not my baby.
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.3612	Any reason to roll your own test framework? It looks like one big issue is that you don't handle exceptions in the runner, so cleanup won't be guaranteed
	0.034	0.9	0.066	0.3102	<@Beula> I handle exceptions in the real code, they are included in the "do some stuff, execute the actual test" comment. In any event, I thought it made sense to execute the tests this way, and I have a Jenkins job that that does so by executing main.py (each test case being called from within the main file). Really I'm just curious if that goes against any conventions or industry practices because I want to correct any bad habits. I don't really have a reason for rolling my own framework other than to get better at coding (this is my first coding job).
	0.01	0.946	0.044	0.6343	I'd say that, from experience, don't ever roll your own at work. That's free time stuff until you find a deficiency in community accepted frameworks (unittest or pytest, in the python world for the big couple). Every time I have rolled my own it has bitten me hard.; <@Yessenia> - the `illegal byte sequence` is from stderr of the subprocess, one of the pipes is getting something it can't handle. From the try local it's the `cut -c30`.; If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console). Since from the console you will get bytes back, you'll need to decode and probably strip them
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Are there any that you recommend for UI testing?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	has anyone used pyflot? how is compared to bokeh?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can anyone explain why this works?  Specifically the `b""`?
	0.064	0.703	0.234	0.891	<@Ouida> the docs for `iter` explain it pretty well (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter>).  The second argument is a "sentinel" value, which will create the stop condition when the result of the callable (the lambda function) equals that value; So each iteration it will check the result of the lambda against that value, if they're equal it raises `StopIteration`, a special built in exception to exit a loop.
	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.2523	<@Beula> sure, but what is `b`? it’s not an identifier?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`b''` is a bytes object
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You have a few of those: `r''` -&gt; raw, `b''` -&gt; bytes, `f''` -&gt; f (format)-string
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.2023	so `b''` is basically an empty byte object?

	0.113	0.824	0.064	-0.2716	Hey guys, I'm new to deploying django applications and I've been fighting an issue for two days now, could anyone help me with this? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44666555/django-wsgi-no-module-named-site> I just posted a question in stack overflow and I'm completely stuck at the moment
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.4019	<@Blossom> I think you have a type-o in your question:    The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error
	0.0	0.481	0.519	0.6588	oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Otherwise, some questions:  1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH 2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra; I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance; And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn ; <https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>
	0.033	0.85	0.118	0.9231	Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great; My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?; But now that I remember I couldn't do both at the same time, I could only run gunicorn when nginx was stopped and viceversa; I'll do everything again from scratch and see if I manage to work around it now with gunicorn and nginx
	0.035	0.872	0.094	0.5574	Sounds like you're competing for ports and running into collisions. Nginx should handle 443 and 80, and forward to the "upstream" port (if using gunicorn) used by gunicorn (the `-b` flag can set this); With Django it's also pretty much required to use nginx (or another webserver) to serve the static files (created via `./manage.py collectstatic`)
	0.043	0.911	0.046	0.1179	yeah I thought as much, so I began from scratch and was able to put my app up using `gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 shinra.wsgi`; now, having that, do you have any resource I could use (that could work with either 1.10 or 1.11 and python 3) for setting that up with nginx?; ah.. here is where I got stuck; <https://pastebin.com/r8MrQAPi>; Thats my bash script, I never got it to work haha; Does anyone know how make gunicorn use the python from my virtual environment? for example: `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/python /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi`; running `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi` only works inside my virtual env and not with supervisor; never mind, I got it to work now, my directories were all wrong

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hello, are there open source APIs to access street traffic feed live?
	0.096	0.766	0.138	0.0276	<@Clarence> it's more likely that individual cities and towns will be responsible for publishing feeds if they want to; so no global one
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.6124	and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration; so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc; and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	have you done anything like this before?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct; and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation; which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	ok; so all that classic jazz if request.GET; etc.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	out the window
	0.079	0.856	0.065	-0.1531	Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google; brings up different stuff; a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work
	0.0	0.621	0.379	0.7269	server side or client side?; I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeh perhaps client sided; sending the post request to the DRF API
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	processing it
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4522	<https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>; so that would help client side; server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending; and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance
	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.6249	yeah; and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you; so you can send in a model representation via json from your client; and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with; and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.6124	ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct; or get, put, etc
	0.0	0.125	0.875	0.7906	superb thanks man
	0.0	0.782	0.218	0.6486	<@Mirna> I am trying to get the value inside the li and strip out some text. I will test your code; <@Mirna> Thanks

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm evaluating celery/redis alternatives for task queuing and scheduling. Someone mentioned redislite and apscheduler. Does apscheduler do task queuing or just scheduling? Also, any other alternatives?; This is being used for a Django environment.
	0.105	0.658	0.237	0.4588	So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?; I like that.
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4215	Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple
	0.072	0.838	0.09	0.1901	ah. gotcha.; I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route.; Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?
	0.0	0.812	0.188	0.7351	Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc; Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler 
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4215	True.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Rolland> we're also using huey

	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.8689	hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data.  Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets?  1. Django ORM 2. SQL alchemy  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.6597	<@Dave> thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.; would like to move to postgresql.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Romona> <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>
	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.4149	how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4939	if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.; and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.; i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.128	I think "performance on large data sets" and "ORM" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^; and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data
	0.136	0.725	0.139	0.0243	That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql
	0.0	0.496	0.504	0.7269	sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.
	0.042	0.894	0.064	0.0956	It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB; But if you're doing "big data" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter

	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6597	one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access; and then look at it to see if you can improve it

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM; since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same
	0.058	0.886	0.056	-0.0258	yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework.
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.7906	If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF.

	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.8126	hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file; I was thinking of writing it into a csv; where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
	0.047	0.953	0.0	-0.3269	<@Thelma> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object; You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again
	0.226	0.635	0.14	-0.0917	yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
	0.076	0.762	0.161	0.4404	Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such

	0.082	0.732	0.186	0.5255	oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object; thanks  guys!; hey guys I have a quick question   will dict and dict2 be the same always?
	0.114	0.787	0.099	-0.3029	since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values; this is my best guess; contents and keys i'm confident in; ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same; I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem; if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`
	0.039	0.885	0.076	0.6635	Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@Dorothy> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results

	0.016	0.924	0.06	0.5434	Maybe someone has an idea on a bit of a headscratcher I have. I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that I’m aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of it’s users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?

	0.116	0.696	0.188	0.7376	True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think when you use --data with curl, it will do a HTTP POST request, with the data in the request body.; To do the same with `requests`, you'd use `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>("<http://httpbin.org/post>", data=payload)`; So, `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` instead of `requests.get()` to make a HTTP POST request.

	0.154	0.846	0.0	-0.6113	Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
	0.122	0.812	0.066	-0.2575	I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).; However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirna> is this some sort of single page web app?
	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.3818	Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.; But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow; one minute they can only render 5-6 page; Which cannot serve my purpose
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirna> can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	Let's keep our conversation public; I'm not the only one who can help you
	0.073	0.897	0.029	-0.507	Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel. So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.; So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.; My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.; But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yeah, you said that a couple of times already.
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.2023	and not the only who need to solve it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirna> have you seen my previous question?
	0.057	0.891	0.052	-0.1027	Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.; <@Collette> and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.
	0.0	0.942	0.058	0.5514	You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?; You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from "Network" tab; That's pretty much it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.
	0.078	0.698	0.224	0.6124	You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes. If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever
	0.179	0.574	0.246	0.0433	Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already.
	0.09	0.878	0.032	-0.4939	<@Mirna> Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?; I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup.
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.8225	Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered. I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better
	0.081	0.919	0.0	-0.4767	I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.; I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how many cores on these machines?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	8 cores.
	0.078	0.831	0.091	0.1953	so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems; not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now.  given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction; however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out; and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances; just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.; <@Mirna> what instance size are you running this on, and what provider?

	0.338	0.375	0.287	-0.1027	Hello guys I got a huge problem
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Hyman> ask away
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	We've been ask as assignment the implementation of Dijkstra's and Bellman Ford's algorithm for calculating the shortest path in a given graph
	0.338	0.662	0.0	-0.4696	So what's the issue?; run into a problem?
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.4019	I don't really know how to start and that's my problem
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.2732	Well were you given code to start off with as far as "i will give you this input" in order to build the graph you have with the path weights and what not?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The Input to the algorithms is an oriented graph with weights
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	So then you have to build the graph in the code, yes?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	More precisely compute the shortest path from a given source to all the other nodes
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.3612	I understand that, I am just asking if you have anything to build off of like code given to you to complete the task or if you have to start from scratch and build the graph in code then calculate it.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You need to code the algorithm from scratch and supply it with a graph in a text file and it'll calculate the shortest path in it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you give an example input
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.1513	<@Hyman> how much experience do you have writing code?; for example, there are quite a number of existing examples of the algorithms you're talking about
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	basic i'm just starting
	0.064	0.913	0.024	-0.5651	ok; can you describe the steps on how you execute the algorithm?; and do you understand why those steps are necessary?; if so, then the next step you take is translating your written description of the process into pseudocode; once you have a reasonable sequence of actions, you then implement the pseudocode in your language of choice; frankly, the first two items are always the most difficult; because it requires you to understand the problem domain; once you understand it, making it work is usually much less effort
	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.4019	Yes I understand how those work
	0.278	0.722	0.0	-0.4019	just having trouble translating described steps to code?
	0.0	0.869	0.131	0.8201	I saw this today, <https://github.com/stackimpact/stackimpact-python>. Looks nice, but don't think we could use that internally. Anyone have any experience with Stack Impact, or know of something that would provide similar data without sending it to an outside source? Even just having the data print out at the end of a run would be great.
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.4019	<@Meghan> I dont know of any tool that does all of that. But I know of many tools that do peices; What data are you mainly interested in?
	0.07	0.66	0.269	0.8641	The charts are pretty, but I would just like to see which calls are blocking and for how long.; For most of my code it's pretty clear anyway, and I throw in timing decorators at the really long ones.
	0.0	0.73	0.27	0.4005	so, if you just want CPU profiling, then vprof works really well.
	0.104	0.803	0.094	-0.0772	Having a monitoring system for users who use my scripts would be nice too though. Right now I just have them email the logs if somethign goes wrong.
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.4201	So, for "errors", I highly recommend sentry; basically, anyone not using sentry, should be doing it right now; its a game changer
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.5859	Having a syslog server for loggign would be amazing, however the logs get extremely large for some scripts.; One of them produces a log so large the last step in the script is to zip and delete its own logs.
	0.169	0.831	0.0	-0.5362	So, what do you actually use the logs for though?; just trying to figure out what went wrong?
	0.223	0.688	0.089	-0.5106	Determine why some data was missed or not parsed correctly, why communication failed on a device, why an exception occurred.; Yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would try using sentry instead of logging; it might change your life
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	here is the page: <https://sentry.io/welcome/>; but its an Open source project, so you can host it yourself and dont have to use the SaaS
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.4448	Is anyone aware of a standard library utility related to the `ast` module that can extract the source of a function without evaluation? Or more specifically, the ability to trace the execution path to a function without evaluation?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.8818	what are you really looking for?; there are various ones for different things; if you just want to look at the function, etc, then `inspect` works pretty well; &gt; the ability to trace the execution path to a function without evaluation What does this mean? you want to look and see what the "stack" might look like had the function ran?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Signe> Right, I'm essentially trying to get the stack without actually executing the code.
	0.049	0.848	0.102	0.3049	can you display what your dataframe looks like and what you want it to look like?; i.e. are you trying to just drop a row?; not really understanding what the issue is, is it upon export you're getting the indices?

	0.122	0.765	0.112	-0.0516	Yeah, I think I'm just going to take a crack a dumbed down approach that just works for simple functions.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So, `inspect` will give you the source code, then you can keep going down that path
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.8539	<@Georgeann> I believe `read_html` tries to find a `&lt;table&gt;` tag in the HTML, so if you want to load an HTML table into a DataFrame, then that would probably be a good usage instead of trying to extract it yourself with XPath or another XML parsing library.; Thanks for your help!
	0.343	0.657	0.0	-0.6385	<@Carlie> thats a really really hard problem. Especially with the dynamicness of python

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Staci> if this is a string, then you can tell that there is a "],[" motiff that would split it into the logical pieces.; You just have to examine it, think, and then act.

	0.199	0.572	0.229	-0.0415	well , it's like the 'is_admin' field ,right?,isn't the best choice,but it's fine , i don't see any drawbacks "for a very limited scope permissions"
	0.029	0.971	0.0	-0.2944	Can anyone see any major drawbacks of having a simple boolean 'can_write` field on a user object for a very limited scope permissions (literally for the forseeable future: read/only and read/write)? We have a different user object per subdomain (not my call) - and rather than porting a whole permissions framework over, to me this seems reasonable; I figure that's enough to not lock us in too much if we need more. A simple migration could get us to a more involved permissions model
	0.082	0.796	0.122	0.1226	It is actually broken JSON, so I'm surprised that it returns it. You can `strip` the { and }, then use `split` on the ":", and you should have the key and the value
	0.0	0.717	0.283	0.7964	Probably they're not using a json library to generate that output. I guess they're just concatenating strings and hope for the best.

	0.107	0.725	0.168	0.4767	Only tangentially Python related, but does anyone know good ways of generating code-related documents offline? I'm struggling with static blog generators like Pelican because trying to coerce Pelican and Pygments and ReStructuredText to cooperate to do what I want is twisting my mind
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm, not python but have you looked at jekyll?
	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.1531	I'm on Windows and Jekyll is a bit awkward on that platform

	0.101	0.785	0.115	-0.0348	I think my problem is that ReStructuredText is really not that good; If you want more control over the formatting, for instance. Rules like "Multiple successive blank lines are equivalent to a single blank line" make it awkward to introduce whitespace for readability; And if I want to highlight the code, I can do that in blocks via Pygments, but not in literals
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i’ve personally started writing my own markdown filters/extensions for things that I need.
	0.085	0.808	0.107	0.0948	Not sure if anyone can help, but have a quick question regarding <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> , powershell more specifically.; <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C5XHHMXHB/p1498673610887626>
	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.1154	I'd be surprised if that's the case... but is it not working for you?

	0.096	0.867	0.037	-0.4884	<@Johana>  That sounds useful, especially since I've found that both Markdown and reST each only do about 80% of what I want... a different 80%... but unfortunately I only need to do this one piece of documentation then I'll probably never need it again, so it's hard to justify the time expense
	0.0	0.97	0.03	0.1655	<@Myong> I believe powershell requires a path be stated to any executable not in the search path. But, a ./myscript.py is sufficient.; Or, in this case, .exe; <@Signe> I showed the lead engineer Sentry. System looks cool, but he thinks we would hit the 20k transactions per day fairly quickly. Do you know of similar systems without limits?

	0.565	0.435	0.0	-0.0772	<@Gabriele> sorry?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	A month is not a fixed unit of time (at least not in the cultures I know of)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I need to know how many months have passed between two dates
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.0772	If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.6369	for example I started it today - June 2017, and the end - June 2016. The difference - 12 months; I think the best way is to pass the Python...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does this work? `((endDay.year - startDay.year) * 12) + (endDay.month - startDay.month)`
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	works; Thank you. You are a genius.
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.5994	You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st; no problem
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	exactly...
	0.09	0.872	0.037	-0.6312	<@Meghan> if you self host, there is no limit; I would recommend that. With docker its really not all that hard to host it; thats what I do. All similar systems will have some type of limit. There is also bugsnag, and rollbar, but they all have limits; self hosting is the only way to have no limits. Oh, I guess google cloud has one called stack-driver that is just a flat monthly fee + minimal data charges

	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4215	if you don't need to do anything complex, dateutil is nice and small

	0.108	0.721	0.171	0.4482	seems to be the one from that environment; I created a new file with a single `import requests` line and am still getting the same error, so i’m pretty sure my environment is messed up. I will delete it and try again though

	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.25	There’s probably a clever command to do it all in one go, but `echo $PATH`will show you your path and you can poke around a few folders to see.
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.1779	`which python3` will show which one is resolved in your PATH
	0.0	0.743	0.257	0.5423	maybe check which directories are in a search path, maybe it will help to solve a mystery:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do that outside of my environment?
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.296	Yeah, if you installed `virtualenv` with `python2` (or `pip` from py2) - it will use that interpreter as the default if you don't give the `--python/-p` flag
	0.168	0.683	0.149	-0.0772	hmm, i gave it the python3 flag and it’s still giving the same error
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.1779	Silly question, I am sure, but did you `pip install -r requirements.txt` since re-creating the env?

	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.0772	capital `V`; you did lowercase, which is a verbose log of the interpreter starting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so it’s using a default `pip3` which installs libs into `/usr/local/lib`, but search path in environment is looking into `./lib/&lt;version&gt;/site-packages`?

	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.7645	i use `pyenv` with `pyenv-virtualenv`. both of them together allow you to use a `.python_version` file. The python_version file is kept in the root dir of your project. When you change into the project’s dir it will activate the right virtualenv for you. it’s quite nice although the instructions of getting it going weren’t all too clear.   <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv> <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv>

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does anyone know of a way to fetch and update a user with a single db trip in django?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lasonya> why?
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	i'm looking for a way to optimise my db calls; <@Collette>
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3939	<@Lasonya> have you profiled your views? Are you sure fetching and updating users is the most expensive operation?
	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.5267	well for large data sets it sure is <@Collette>. how do you mean 'profiled your views '?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I mean what makes you think that this is the most expensive operation? Do you _think_ so or you have profiled your code so you _know_ it's the most expensive operation?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Looking up one record in your user table, and updating that record, is really the bottleneck? That sounds quite suprising to me, too.
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.5423	That may be the bottleneck, for sure. Which is likely to be fixed by creating a proper index.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anyways in sql you are able to retrieve data from an `update` query
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ruben> <@Collette> won't it be performant to have one db trip to fetch and update rather than have two trips?
	0.0	0.449	0.551	0.5994	<@Lasonya> please, google about premature optimization
	0.0	0.44	0.56	0.6249	Your remark smells like premature optimisation
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	i like this <@Ciera>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> Some DBMSses indeed can, see RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL's UPDATE. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-update.html>
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah that's what I was referring to
	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.4364	...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.; I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.; <@Ciera> So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row; if you have read only data for example
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed.
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.5859	I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app; even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow
	0.0	0.73	0.27	0.7427	if your db is on the network you gain a bit; but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have
	0.138	0.759	0.103	0.0	plus if I can get an empty page in 30 ms and a heavy page in 40 ms, then there is no point in optimizing just yet
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yum yum!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	any pandas people in here?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’ve used it a little
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.4199	I'm trying to do a groupby on a df; and the field I'm trying to group on needs to be preprocessed; I'm trying to figure out how to offload the preprocessing of that field to C so its not slow as crap; it seems like `df.groupby(by=func_to_preprocess, df.ColumnToGroup)` should work, but the `by=` field seem to want the column header; or a function; but not both
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Rudolph>, what is the function doing?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if it’s 1 “column”, use `.map`

	0.0	0.697	0.303	0.8268	lol, definitely; In general, take a look at `.applymap`, `.map` and `.apply`. All very useful when you learn how they operate on the dataframe.
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	Hi guys ,is there something like django-restframework or flask-restplus for tornado?
	0.085	0.85	0.065	-0.1759	Hey!; I can’t seem to import the slackclient correctly; I keep getting an import error. I tried googling around and their fixes didn’t really work; it’s installed for sure, so I don’t know why I can’t import
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you do a `pip freeze`; or `pip3 freeze`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The issue is your `pip3` is from `python 3.6` but your `python3` command is running `python 3.5`; ; Execute the script with `python3.6`
	0.0	0.263	0.737	0.4215	nice spot
	0.078	0.858	0.064	-0.3919	ahh i figured it out, i used pip3.5, which i’ve never used before; I’m getting a new computer in a few days, how can I prevent myself from having 7 different python versions?; and yes, I was setting up the virtualenv wrapper but ran into an error doing so
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what model mac, windows, etc.?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mac!
	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.4588	on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don’t want to use system python for anything.; then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ahh ok
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.5399	Thanks!!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yah i’m trying to install virtualenvwrapper; but am getting that; my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it’s different if i’m using zsh, correct?
	0.0	0.95	0.05	0.3612	; something like that; yea you put it in your zshconfig however you have that setup.; i load my zsh config via my own script that i call at the end of the config zsh uses.; `WORKON_HOME` is the dir where all your virtualenvs are installed when you write the `mkvirutualenv` command
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Just the last line should be sufficient 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i trimmed it down to those two.
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	yeah, `~/.zshrc`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Done!; got it
	0.292	0.708	0.0	-0.3566	so now no need to run this?
	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.6369	I wish more shells had bash compatibility layers like `fish` does 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the last two lines you paste into your shell config
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.5719	you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn’t too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.
	0.0	0.156	0.844	0.6588	ahh ok; thanks!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.
	0.212	0.788	0.0	-0.5423	It’s bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?
	0.0	0.673	0.327	0.6538	virtual environments are extremely cool, but they definitely have a learning curve to them
	0.065	0.761	0.174	0.5945	lots of things have changed in ansible now.; yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started.; i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those.
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.0772	why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?
	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.5994	i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.; lol; when you need to manage python versions.
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.6597	i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.; i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.
	0.205	0.709	0.087	-0.4588	Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess
	0.111	0.889	0.0	-0.5216	If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	Yeah was just realizing that
	0.293	0.707	0.0	-0.358	I’ve heard! they’re very confusing at first
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I m new to python community and has not worked much; And also clustering

	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.659	Ah ok. I came from C++ a long time ago, and I found the standard Python tutorial quite a good read. And I found some 'Python for C++ programmers' online texts.

	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.4404	Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB.  Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	flask
	0.084	0.916	0.0	-0.296	+1 for that use case; Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.659	i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.; <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Johana> Can you tell me more about it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I will log request, pageviews and other user actions.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you have any experience with flask?; or python web frameworks?; i try not to assume things.
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	Yes I've decent experience on django
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i also had to get my kid off of the table.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.2263	okay
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved.
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ok then
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You used Flask + ES + Kibana?
	0.128	0.872	0.0	-0.296	no kibana; in my project recently.; my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How did you build dashboard?
	0.0	0.375	0.625	0.6124	Yeah, that will be nice.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i've few questions.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	k
	0.0	0.869	0.131	0.7269	Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.; Is it something like this -  1. User creates an event. 2. Flask view logs data in ES. 3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.; Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.4404	I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/> They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture; ES will be better than this?
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.4696	yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.; do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?; or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.0772	I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cost involved?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How many VMs you used?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?
	0.033	0.869	0.097	0.6048	well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.; it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.; this is my docker-compose.yml for ES:   you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you.
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.0772	So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.296	Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.8126	yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{"id": 1, "name": "a1gupta", "role": "1", "created_on": "2017-10-11 343434"}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.; that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Elane> don't use `install`?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So there can be multiple `{'10.01.2005': {'issue': ['important1', 'important2'], 'url': ['url1', '<http://google.com>']}}` ?
	0.173	0.655	0.173	0.0	all. tired better not to sit at the computer. go to the beach.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so if important3 and url3 came in, there are different "10.01.2005" that it can go into?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	append, it list.; `z[date]["issue"].append(df["issue"][i])` everything is very easy.))
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.2646	I don't think you can use a dictionary for this. Hopefully someone else can confirm, but I think you're looking at using a list instead.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	z[date]['issue'] is probably a list
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.3939	and the date stay the same? So Jan 5, 2017 would have two {url_result, issue} sets?; actually, take another look at leovp's solution.
	0.0	0.25	0.75	0.4588	Exactly :)
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.0772	In PyCharm, can you have the project run kick off a bunch of things at once? For example, I want to run Django, Celery Workers, and Celery Beat
	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.5719	If you find out that share it with me. I have to open like 5 command windows to get started
	0.102	0.694	0.204	0.296	haha, no kidding. I guess if you don't need a bunch of workers you can run beat and the worker:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is that it?
	0.42	0.58	0.0	-0.4404	I think those block before starting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`&amp;`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula> i use honcho to do that now.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I tried to run the worker and beat with django-beat and it didn't seem to work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And running django in a docker container involves too much hacking. I prefer to just run postgres and redis in it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but you can use it as a library.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you don’t necessarily need the Procfile
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yeah <@Mariano> I have docker running postgres and redis
	0.0	0.753	0.247	0.3182	I wrote it on version 3 because i'm a cool kid
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	thanks <@Johana> I will look at that; What's new in v3?
	0.0	0.5	0.5	0.4588	haha; time to update...
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	<@Beula> good example here:   <https://github.com/hypothesis/h/blob/master/h/cli/commands/devserver.py#L60-L89>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`os.environ[‘PYTHONUNBUFFERED’] = ‘true’`
	0.302	0.698	0.0	-0.0772	sorry about that paste
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the example is the click cli that hypothesis (pyramid app) uses. then you can put this in your make file. <https://github.com/hypothesis/h/blob/master/Makefile#L30>
	0.143	0.633	0.224	0.2263	Oh nice - I'll keep that in my back pocket. I like keeping things stupid simple as long as I can
	0.0	0.682	0.318	0.4215	with flask, webpack, and react it’s nice.
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	Yeah - that totally makes sense
	0.0	0.345	0.655	0.5859	wow that's handy
	0.0	0.276	0.724	0.8885	Yep, honcho is great. already in love

	0.154	0.689	0.157	-0.1891	Hi, all. I have three pandas data frame. Challenge them to unite and write the result to a file. The first two has common headers. a third plug on the left.  Everything is good, except a wrong result, not beautiful. <http://imgur.com/VIoHXnel.png> this problem <http://imgur.com/cdUxjkrl.png> - so it looks in the editor and need <http://imgur.com/gmY8UtKl.png> <http://imgur.com/1e4fRKnl.png> I hope for your help, just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Thank you.
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	Looks like you need `merge`, not `concat`.
	0.1	0.858	0.042	-0.4256	<@Suellen> the first two data frame which has common columns normally unites, the problem with the third. the third has no common poles with the first two. the `merge` would be for the first and second if I understand correctly. But why? And so they're fine.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nothing happens. first two should be together? Then the two third?; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	[silly] question for the slack bot experts: in many examples I keep seeing a variable named BOT_ID, what is this ID? All I get from slack is the bot token
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.7814	this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?; I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens; so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something; what I'm trying to do is test the correct exception is thrown/handled; so I was thinking...
	0.265	0.735	0.0	-0.2023	`as new_object` looks strange to me
	0.119	0.746	0.134	0.0772	If you are testing code I believe both pytest and unitest have special context manager to test errors
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just do 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yah that is unittest
	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.4767	also, don't test anything else in this function; you're testing only the fact that wrong URL causes an exception
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in that case if the assert is correct the test will continue as expected
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with the `as new_object` I can pass it through the rest of the code as an exception object which I found here<https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises>
	0.0	0.616	0.384	0.7964	but <@Suellen> make a good point; oh ok. You want to test what is in the exception ?
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4404	thanks <@Suellen> that does make sense; right; and how the rest of the code responds to that <@Ciera> if that makes sense
	0.053	0.864	0.083	0.2247	both object have the same name that's a little confusing; you can interact with the exception after the `with` like any other object. For example to check what's inside
	0.0	0.656	0.344	0.6369	Best way to order a list based on another list?
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.6124	there is something like `sorted()`; and I guess you can pass like a lambda to do custom sort
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do you have a specific question about dns ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> I'm using namecheap; Does this record look alright?; Or should it be the whole domain name?
	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.296	this will point `www.my_awesome_website` to the same IP as `c.storage....`; no you don't need to put the whole name
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	yes; if you do `dig www.my_awesome_website` you should see the result
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	well it seems to be pointing the right way
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; Maybe I'm unlucky and DNS take an unusually long time to update?
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.25	; Huh, now dig returns way less data then 1 minute before.; Alright, it's probably Namecheap shenanigans; There is a reason they are not "Nameexpensive"
	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.6858	did you change something ? I had one time a saved that wasn't taken into account so I just redid it; they are usually not too bad
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.2023	At the moment the uploaded files are at the same directory as the script, upload works fine.
	0.041	0.865	0.094	0.3527	So the server code needs to change to support saving in another directory - otherwise it's a vulnerability (directory traversing attack); Do you control the server side code?; And you want to store the photos from the client machine in a different folder, or the server?
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.7851	<@Beula> you've used the undocumented Slack method `setInactive` right? It says here that this method doesn't work on the free tier. Is this true?
	0.457	0.543	0.0	-0.4939	I've not used that one, sorry :(
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	Thanks :))
	0.057	0.92	0.023	-0.4453	Maybe os.path.join() can help?; Do you mean the website where I post the ads or the machine where my script runs?; Script runs on my OSX, website is not mine, so no access.; On my machine, at the moment, at the same folder as my python script, and I want to store the photos in a subfolder.
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.4767	Oh, okay. Yeah, you should be able to just move them and `os.path.join`
	0.0	0.423	0.577	0.6249	great, I will try now …
	0.059	0.941	0.0	-0.4567	umm, I have questions 1. about `map` vs `as_completed`, if I dont care for the result order, I should use `as_completed` right? 2. If I use `map`, then even my 2nd job finished earlier than the 1st, my executor still wait for the 1st to finished then push new job to the executor?
	0.204	0.796	0.0	-0.6619	<@Gabriele>  I am thinking it might be due to missing dependencies for the `checksum` def. But I am not sure how to check that as the logs dont help much
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	<@Hermina> jobs are pushed when a pool isn't completely full; Take a look: <https://pymotw.com/3/concurrent.futures/>; There you can see better (almost real-life) examples.
	0.196	0.623	0.181	-0.0423	<@Kymberly> Missing dependencies in Python don't cause syntax errors

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Anyone knows how to set an script to run every 2nd sunday in a month ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	linux/mac/windows ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Linux. I'm using crontabs on django-beat; I haven't found a way to do that using a crontab
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have seen some hacking with bash but i think i don't have that available; just a plain crontab
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	don't have shell? how?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11683387/run-every-2nd-and-4th-saturday-of-the-month>; it seems you need a small bash script indeed
	0.025	0.914	0.06	0.2023	The crontab is ran by a scheduler built with on top of celery. Introducing the equivalent to the bash script will involve too much hacking i think; meh. I'll just run the script every sunday (well they are celery tasks). And have the task checking if it's on the week that i want
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.4215	that should be the easiest
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I saw that the weekdays and the day of the month are an `or` proposition on crontabs
	0.105	0.746	0.149	0.0772	What’s wrong with the following substring in my SQLite Create Table command?  &gt; 24h_volume_usd; Turns out columns cannot start with numbers. To anyone else curious
	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.1154	Beat me to it... I suspected it, but was actually googling to confirm that
	0.065	0.766	0.169	0.5574	it's best to ask in <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> <@Jacinta> <@Beula> (who is the main dev for the website atm) might miss it here
	0.059	0.543	0.398	0.8172	Feel free to join us over in <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> :)  sorry, was off biking and grilling today!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi peeps. What is the most state-of-art machine learning technique or research project on learning langauge?; *language (clearly i have a reason for my research)
	0.0	0.972	0.028	0.1306	What do you mean by 'learning language'? This is a VERY wide field; Are you familiar with word2vec? It's not the 'most' state of the art but it represented a big step forward a few years ago and is widely used; (You might also reach a more specific audience in <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> , but there are fewer people there)
	0.338	0.375	0.287	-0.1027	Hello guys, I got a huge problem
	0.286	0.4	0.314	0.126	Cool, thanks! No worries, biking and grilling should always take precedence.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	someone will read it and say something, but you need to put your issue out first
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.0772	There is a website and a WiFi network. And what i want to do is to automatically connect any person on my WiFi to the website without theme authenticate themselves directly on the website
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Simple, flippant answer: disable authentication on your website
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.296	No no, that isn't that. Persons on my WiFi can connect themselves but those out of it need to authenticate themselves
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you have a static IP?
	0.688	0.312	0.0	-0.5267	No, no static IP
	0.046	0.954	0.0	-0.0772	then sorry; if you had a static IP through your ISP, then you could check the IP address on the incoming request; and then filter to authentication if necessary
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If you're on a Windows domain you can do more, but that's a bit specialized
	0.034	0.966	0.0	-0.0772	can you run custom code on the wifi router?  you might be able to have it regularly send its ip; when it updates you might have a moment where the site isn’t accessible, but it might do the trick.
	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.4445	My problem now is to authenticate a person from it's IP address since I don't want to change even the website code
	0.0	0.743	0.257	0.765	why?; ok, better step back and describe things in more detail; because it sounds like you're trying to do some things that are not advisable
	0.168	0.648	0.184	-0.17	and depending on how secure you want this, IP whitelisting may not be the best bet
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	since you can spoof and use VPNs, and more
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Have the site listen on 2 network interfaces, one inward-facing to your network, one outward-facing to the internet, and the inward facing one can use different auth criteria
	0.052	0.904	0.044	-0.1406	<@Meg> Let me explain it more detailly; There is a website that I am setting up and i want to grant direct access to persons i a given location that is persons connected to my WiFi. If a person is connected to my WiFi, he can access the website with no problem, but if he is not in my WiFi, he should enter a passcode before proceeding to the site's content
	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.7906	why do you want to have such a huge hole in your authentication; just have them sign in; and keep a session cookie active for them; and so when they re-access the site, their login session is still active
	0.075	0.817	0.108	0.12	I've seen this sort of thing done before to facilitate company intranets, and that's done primarily just by virtue of listening on an inward-facing network address. But sometimes there is still extra auth anyway, because it's not a great hardship.
	0.104	0.896	0.0	-0.3736	Is it the case that it’s irrelevant *who* the user is that accesses content?  i.e. there is no user data specific to a user?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	...also that.
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.6249	if it’s truly irrelevant who people are, then yeah, I’d combine <@Gabriele>’s comment with a VPN from the wifi router to the network that second interface is on
	0.103	0.613	0.284	0.6917	not a bad suggestion; <@Hyman> do you have the expertise to do this?; <@Hyman> best to say your problem; why?
	0.0	0.639	0.361	0.8834	what's the best way to join on a string x time the same value ?; like `', '.join('hello' for _ in my_list)`; But it seems a bit overkill
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	<@Ciera>: is there a better way than that?
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	`'hello ' * n`; where `n` is the number of times to repeat
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.3818	I hoped something existed for that. I'll stay with the for loop more readable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`('hello, ' * n).strip(', ')`?
	0.08	0.796	0.124	0.3736	Quick side question for my project server; is forcing https everywhere bad?; should i rollback and switch to 1? Not really python but web related, haha; No, I run House of Carts.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	looked into what house of carts was
	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.128	<@Patty> : it's legal, just breaks site ToS I think
	0.202	0.674	0.124	-0.34	Oh. Yeah, the community is generally against enabling breaking TOS or anything Illegal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.52	0.48	0.4005	its a big grey area, so, yeah
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4019	What? I asked for help with setting up a SSL certificate that has nothing to do with a sneaker group..
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.4019	I think it's more the soliciting DMs for help and such
	0.261	0.681	0.058	-0.7227	Ah, okay. He’s the one who asked if I needed a dev, but there’s not really a need right now.; No worries though
	0.141	0.784	0.075	-0.4019	Okay, generally speaking - the group would prefer to not be used for anything gray-area or illegal, whether DM, public, or private channels

	0.081	0.919	0.0	-0.4391	I am just getting my feet wet with building stuff out of bits and parts i find and cleaning it up for my use.  I am still quite noob. This slack has pulled me out of the fire many times where i wanted to bang my head into the wall
	0.106	0.843	0.051	-0.3182	Question about unit testing and type hinting - is there a simple way to assert that a function call returns a certain type and that there are no other type warnings if return types have already been hinted in the function signature?
	0.0	0.492	0.508	0.7351	mypy probably; It's pretty intelligent in type inferring
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it possible to run nosetests with mypy?
	0.057	0.721	0.222	0.7968	anyone have any recommendations on best ways to test flask api’s?  I am writing an api in flask and want to do unittests on it but not sure the best way to do it with flask
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.0772	do you want unit tests or integration tests?
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.6597	well this is all sorta new to me as far as testing goes I haven’t done it much in the past but I want to mainly ensure the code works and get back proper responses, etc; since its basically a bot
	0.027	0.912	0.062	0.3818	So there are various levels of testing. If you want a lot of confidence, you should do `end-to-end` testing; which basically means you spin up your app, then use `requests` to hit the api's and check that they actually work; an integration test would be just calling the handler, not using http. And a unit test would only check the logic of one function alone, as in, the function where the logic is
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Unfortunantly I dont know of any "api testing frameworks" in python
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its more of how do I test flask
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.288	but its really not very hard to just write tests that use requests
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	since its a flask app
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and call your app
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea if thats all it is I guess I can do that
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.0772	You also might want to look at: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/>; or ask more questions in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
	0.035	0.876	0.089	0.4754	I was more curious how I test it and where for example where do I spin up the code and test it or does it just do it all local, etc; yea I’ve been looking over that doc; problem is that one is very db driven and I’m not even using a db yet, just want to test simple flask routes, maybe I’ll just go the route of requests; I’ll see what I can find, thanks
	0.152	0.848	0.0	-0.3612	if you dont have a DB then ignore the DB code; the rest will still work
	0.0	0.931	0.069	0.3182	yea thats why I’m checking it out just wasn’t sure if there was anything else or if this is the only info I’ve asked in flask too; didn’t realize they had a channel

Any options?
	0.124	0.693	0.183	0.2354	i think you can use map, Not sure if it would improve the code
	0.09	0.846	0.065	-0.128	could change line 12 to be `for item in page.get('Contents', []):` or whatever empty iterable you want; saves a line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Similarly `if item.get('Key', '').endswith('htm') or item.get('Key', '').endswith('html'):`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I thought of that; but feel the readability is so-so
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah gets a little overly verbose there
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	I like this one
	0.071	0.605	0.324	0.7259	alright, thanks; It was the nested looping and checks that I was unsure about; wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something more pythonic

	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3612	<@Hyman> what kinda of enviroment do you have for wifi.; <@Hyman> define single sing on.  To my network ears that sounds like 802.11x; for your needs
	0.048	0.845	0.107	0.8122	got a celery question here.  I have a master task, for lack of a better word, that takes in a list of URLs and chunks it up to an appropriate number of sub-tasks to execute for indexing in a solr server  I'd like to be able to record in the model record for that particular instance _how_ many URLs were successfully indexed.  But as the sub-tasks are executing asynchronously, with no feedback to the parent task, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to update the db on completion of the last sub-task.; Only thing I can think of is for each subtask to increment/update the db record on completion.  Is there a more elegant way to do this with Celery?
	0.063	0.82	0.118	0.4848	I don't think that is too inelegant, but you could have the parent task get all results of the subtasks by polling them and do it that way - not sure it's much more elegant though
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.7906	yeah, agreed; thats about what I was thinking as well; but its pretty necessary for the parent and child tasks to be on different queues
	0.0	0.965	0.035	0.4215	Anyone have experience trying to persist CloudSearch/Elasticsearch search results? I am working on a system that maps document ids to search queries so relational data can be added in an RDS. However because documents AND search queries can be edited you need to routinely re-run the search to see if new documents need to be added in the mapping table or delete the outdated ones and the runtime is just going to grow as documents and saved search queries are added.
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.0258	<@Meg> - I don't think which queue they run on matters for getting a result
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula> I have to think about the queue and workers getting clogged up
	0.203	0.625	0.172	-0.1027	yeah, so the master task blocking them will cause issues
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct; thus, the different queues
	0.134	0.648	0.218	0.2023	It would only block on 1 worker; But yeah, in that case - DB increment seems like the option
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.8068	nobody else here uses python or the tools I use, so its good to get confirmation; he's probably sleeping right now; but woould be interested in his and <@Patty>'s feedback as well
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I thought they had an on-done callback option, but I am not seeing it

	0.084	0.712	0.204	0.5719	Yeah, I'll probably do that in the master task, combined with polling of the subtasks. When the subtasks complete, the master will finish as well, and then can handle success, failure, etc

	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.0772	Hi; Does anyone have experience in `protobuf`? I want to know how to map a `dictionary` to `protobuf`. I’ve tried this one : `<https://github.com/davyzhang/dict-to-protobuf>`. But it doesn’t work in nested case.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirna> found in one of my projects: `from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, dict_to_protobuf`; The library is called `protobuf3-to-dict`; And it handles nested data
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There's also <https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/python/google/protobuf/json_format.py#L112> that from the protobuf library
	0.104	0.851	0.045	-0.3318	So I ended up trying to use Flask-HTTPAuth as recommended in this thread <https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/issues/492> however I'm getting `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'as_view'` even with the most basic demo code. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work...
	0.0	0.656	0.344	0.2732	Well, functions don't have `as_view`
	0.0	0.947	0.053	0.1901	<https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/blob/ff64cdbef03aa2ce108a7dc06ca336035ec68b70/flask_restful/__init__.py#L444>; Flask-restful registers a view like this; and the view is supposed to be a class; which have an `as_view` method it seems; but `@auth.login_required` returns a function. do you apply this decorator to a class?
	0.0	0.604	0.396	0.8346	Oh shooooooooooot!! Wow! You're right! I had it on a class rather than a function.; Thanks a million!
	0.226	0.774	0.0	-0.5423	Is it considered bad practice to append the working dir to the `sys.path` ?
	0.028	0.815	0.158	0.8174	i think it may be frowned upon. i usually try to avoid it but when i need alembic `env.py` to be aware of my metadata i do this so that i can import it and have it do autogenerated migrations. The benefits i get out of that are huge so i think it’s worth appending to the sys.path.
	0.0	0.526	0.474	0.4019	In general cases, yes
	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.5423	ok. It's the only solution I found for <@Alesia> to import plugins without the need to have them installed
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then make them pip installable!
	0.132	0.811	0.056	-0.4855	yeah they should be but your custom config is also a plugin; so making a `setup.py` and installing that every them you modify isn't very user friendly
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	What's the config look like?
	0.0	0.677	0.323	0.7964	Is it not just a yaml in `~/.sirbotrc`; if that works and it makes the user experience better, that's a good solution
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.5423	yes but you also need to do your business logic; what sirbot-pythondev is to us; just wanted to know if it was `oh my god never do that` or more `best not to but hey it's python go ahead`
	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.3612	Hey guys reading some idiomatic Python and saw they had a pattern match on a tuple. Just wondering what `user` would look like here for this to be able to work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's just iterable unpacking, you don't need the parens even for it. The "user" here is some sequence type.  You can do that with dicts I think now, but only 3.6+ retain order

	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	<@Loise> Can the requests library do what you want? There are some retry examples in <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431044/can-i-set-max-retries-for-requests-request>

	0.0	0.704	0.296	0.6486	maybe `logging` will do what you want? something like:  Then under your requests `response` object do something like  
	0.313	0.579	0.108	-0.6486	Getting this annoying error — requirements are satisfied, chromedriver in the right place, this error comes upon launching a chrome window
	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.6597	it implies there's a problem with the server, but it could also just be that the package doesn't handle that situation properly. It's unlikely to be your fault
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> how can I fix it?
	0.041	0.959	0.0	-0.2617	That depends on what you mean by fix. If the server is broken and you don't control the server, it's unfixable. If the package just doesn't understand something the server is doing, it's probably possible to patch the package, but that would probably be a job for the package maintainer
	0.047	0.903	0.05	0.0245	<@Beula> Do you know why sometimes they dont get credited even though they were sent? not a big deal just curious - there were a couple that I "received" but last I checked they never got tallied
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Martha> it only works in public channels, if they don't send you may need to `/invite <@Lenny>`
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6369	cool thanks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the reason being is `str(None)` results in `'None'`, which is a string; open up a python shell; enter in `str(None)`; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anyone know how to get ids from transmission using their api?; <http://transmissionrpc.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.7/reference/transmissionrpc.html#transmissionrpc.Client.get_files>
	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.4295	<@Meg> Thanks for reply! Yeah, but there is function which does not filter it:
	0.039	0.887	0.074	0.4588	or use code formatting; <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>; so the reason why that function is not working is because you're using `and` for everything; there's no way a variable can be `''` and `' '` at the same time; so, for you, the best thing would be to break it out into an if-else conditional test
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how firm is the requirement that a list test include a sub-list?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	eg `test_items = [['None'], '', ' ', 'item']`?
	0.088	0.717	0.195	0.4019	Right. In fact, it's looks like `list = [ [item,item1,item3], item, [item4,item5], [None] ] `; So i need to check when there is no value.
	0.164	0.738	0.098	-0.1531	and definition of no value is an empty string; or a string with just spaces; or an item of type `None`; correct?
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.6486	`not val` satisfies `None` and `""` the other two are strings so can be matched like `val not in (' ', 'None')`; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wait.. so in your code snipet, it's supposed to return F, T, T, F?
	0.111	0.817	0.072	-0.4053	haven't forgotten about you, milo.; I think I'm going to get banned for this but the problem is that it needs some way of determining what is being passed (string, or list); so if list, and first element exists and that first element is 'None', then it is empty; also, if val does not exist (None or empty), it is also True (is_empty);

	0.059	0.923	0.018	-0.4674	The hash mismatch problem seems fixed by going to the local directory where the issue occurred and running `svn update --set-depth empty` then `svn update --set-depth infinity`; <@Gabriele> yes; It's a outside hosted server; outside of our network that is; Also occasionally run into hanging on update. I use the CLI cause the GUI is just way too slow having to cleanup due to locked repo.; Where in the console it will just sit for a while; and eventually I have to `ctrl-c` and then `svn cleanup` and `svn update`; It probably wouldn't be such a huge PITA, but it's a massive repo

	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	 something like this?
	0.045	0.955	0.0	-0.296	No, it's what you link it as, so the `docker run --name=test-app -p 8000:8000 -it -v $PWD:/app --link my-db --env-file=.env myapp:dev` The `--link my-db` would name the link `my-db`; So I think you need to change your mysql connection string to be looking at the port, not a local socket
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mysql-python; and uri for now 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So presuming you are using `--link my-db`, you should be able to change `localhost` to `my-db` for the host
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	One moment, I’ll try.
	0.169	0.701	0.131	-0.2047	<@Beula> unrelated question, but can you theoretically share the socket between containers? or is this too ridiculous?
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.3182	I am sure there is a way, since a container can declare volumes it provides. I would think that's possible; But I just use the ports, since it's just simpler

	0.116	0.78	0.104	-0.3612	Question about os.stats().st_atime; It's a timestamp representing the last time a file was accessed; but its returning a negative number; -11644473600; which if I use the absolute value represents a Dec 31, 2338; Does this mean the file has never been accessed?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does `stat &lt;file&gt;` in your shell report the same thing?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	um, let me check.
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.0772	<@Staci> shouldnt atime be an unsigned number?
	0.155	0.722	0.124	0.1027	Sorry, took me a minute; This is on a network shared drive; 12/31/1600; for all the tiles; files*; Weird

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I wonder if it has anything to do with noatime family of mount flags. they are often used with ssds
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4019	with AD, times are represented as tickts from midnight, Jan 1 1600 in active directory, powershell cant handle it; it means it wasnt accessed
	0.0	0.656	0.344	0.2732	Well I just opened the file
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	Powershell and AD have different epochs as well; 0001 vs 1600
	0.106	0.745	0.149	0.1779	I think the network shared drive is doing something weird with the last accessed date
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.4939	I bet it doesn't update it to save drive's lifespan
	0.098	0.709	0.193	0.34	yeah since it’s probably managed through AD; basically, it’s a combination of python, Windows, PowerShell, and Active Directory in a storm of a mess
	0.068	0.932	0.0	-0.0258	AD permissions may also be preventing you (or the script) from seeing the last modified time
	0.096	0.85	0.054	-0.4404	That last accessed date was going to come in handy; But it's all fucked; There are like 100,000 files I'm trying to work with, and find out which ones need to be uploaded to a new server and which ones are trash

	0.026	0.923	0.051	0.459	Anyone on tonight? Or maybe tag me if you see this in the morning?  How would I get the index of a namedtuple field through code without looking at the definition? This is so I can write a code that will use this named tuple by field name rather than index so if the indexes change later down the line with code changes it won't break, and for easier reading?    With the counts_client function, I am sending a hardcoded index right now, but I would like to send Query.client. As expected, using Query.client doesn't work here and raises a TypeError for tuple indices must be integers or slices, not property.; Oh, good catch. Oops. PyCharm should have told me that one.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1st, this:  to: ; ; walk me through this
	0.0	0.969	0.031	0.4364	Counter is the Counter from collections. Queries is a list of the Query namedtuple. _query_filter is essentially grep and returns a boolean as to whether to include that entry in the counter or not.  index_to_count is the index of the named tuple. That is where I would much prefer to say Query.query rather than entry[index_to_count]; Or, Query.client, I think it was in that example.; I have two functions, at present, that use the _counts_generic, rather than each repeating the whole function and specifying entry.query or entry.client from the namedtuple.;   Don't know if more code helps.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	 Does this work the same if:  ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	technically, this could all be brought down to:  right?
	0.214	0.696	0.089	-0.3257	No. Include is a whitelist, if include is empty it should give all entries not in exclude.
	0.072	0.892	0.036	-0.2263	because in both of the first 2 if's you are demanding that `entry` not be an element of exclude; okay, ; this is yoru orginal code; so if `include is None`, it goes to the `else` and checks that `entry` be an element of `exclude`; right?; sorry... NOT an element of `exclude`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Right.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but if include NOT None, you are checking that `entry` not an element of `exclude`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	  I could remove the if include and include it in the next if
	0.041	0.959	0.0	-0.2263	I'm just saying that `if include:` doesn't seem to have any bearing on what the condition does.; because entry still has to NOT be an element in `exclude`; so essentially this function returns False when entry is in exclude, regardless of anything else that happens.
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.3089	If include isn't an empty list then the entry is included if not in exclude. If include has entries and the entry matches one of the items in include then the entry is included if not in exclude.; So, if whitelist then only include entry if it is in whilelist (and also not in blacklist).  If only blacklist include everything not in blacklist.
	0.077	0.829	0.094	0.2263	The first if is necessary as well, because without it the code would see if entry is in an empty list, which it never will be and the lack of whitelist means nothing gets through.; It might be better if I changed those variables names to whiltelist and blacklist.
	0.294	0.706	0.0	-0.3612	I think you misunderstand the meaning of include.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	 output: 
	0.023	0.869	0.107	0.8114	Here is one set of my tests for it. The first test shows what the raw data is. ; All of the tests pass as it is currently.; Include is a whitelist, but only used if it isn't an empty list. If include is an empty list then it is ignored.; Your example is the intended result.; It works similarly to the include used on some routers, or like grep in a way. If include isn't specified everything is returned True. If include is populated then it acts as a whiltelist. And exclude works as a blacklist.
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.4215	output: ; &gt; If include isn't specified everything is returned True That's not what is happening.
	0.066	0.708	0.226	0.4881	Sorry, that should say if include isn't specified, and exclude doesn't trigger, then it is returned True.
	0.189	0.547	0.264	0.3919	but I could be wrong. Probably best to wait for someone else to chime in
	0.304	0.435	0.261	0.0772	There is no problem with that code, it tests perfectly.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.078	0.853	0.069	0.1531	Sorry if I was unclear on that.; My question is about the namedtuple.; Rather than sending entry[index] I am wondering, short of a dict or a class, if there is a better way, that is closer to sending entry.query.; <@Deedee>, here you go: <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Thanks.; Full code to the above: <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole>
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.4404	<@Meghan> the easy answer is that you should never change the indexes/order on a named tuple; Thats a breaking change. If your concerned about that, you should probably use a class or dictionary and not let people use indexes
	0.0	0.679	0.321	0.8555	Yeah, I think I probably have to agree there. As nice as namedtuples are, that does make it easy to break things should the data being analyzed changed.
	0.085	0.915	0.0	-0.2411	<@Meghan> Are you trying to get the index of the property, when you first defined it? `Query._fields.index('client')`; Not sure if I understood correctly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I know we already went over this but I really think that:  Should read be: 
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.3847	Except then if include is empty it returns false, which is not the desired effect.; It is an optional whitelist.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.061	0.849	0.09	0.0516	<@Meghan> Just checked the docs, it says "In addition to the methods inherited from tuples, named tuples support three additional methods and two attributes. To prevent conflicts with field names, the method and attribute names start with an underscore."
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meghan> Wouldn't that be the same as mytuple.fieldname ?
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	That's what I've been wondering the whole time, I feel like the point of a named tuple is to be able to use the `.` operator.
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.4215	<@Beula> also, a nice repr; But today we have `attrs`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And it be immutable, etc
	0.069	0.863	0.069	0.0	i need help   this following code is not working  list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] list2 = ["a", "b", "c","d", "e"] dict1 = {} for index1 in xrange(len(list1)): 	dict1[list1[index1]] = list2[index1] print(dict1); error -&gt; NameError: name 'xrange' is not defined
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Reina> I guess you are using Python3. Python3 does not have xrange, instead you can use range.
	0.059	0.88	0.061	-0.2144	<@Shelly>  sir now i am doing this exercise  Use the dictionary, port1 = {21: "FTP", 22:"SSH", 23: "telnet", 80: "http"}, and make a new dictionary in which keys become values and values become keys, as shown: Port2 = {“FTP":21, "SSH":22, “telnet":23, "http": 80  my ans is --&gt; port1 = {21:"FTP",22:"SSH",23:"Telnet",80:"HTTP"} port2 = {}  for v,k in port1.items(): 	port2.append(v + " : " + k)  but showing error
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.5994	Python supports dictionary comprehensions, `port2 = {value:key for key, value in port1.items()}` so iterating the `key, value` pair from each item of the dictionary, and switching their positions for the comprehension will work
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.5719	thanks this is what i did   res = dict((v,k) for k,v in port1.items()) print(res)  and works fine
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4019	<@Reina> You can also use `zip` to build a dictionary from a sequence of keys and a sequence of values:
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.061	0.85	0.09	0.3818	I need help, I have  and I need to restart script for 2 hours How to do that ?; no, this is python script witch provision some API request and I have   but I need to restart script every two hours because API security keys expires after two hours, and then I need to again generate that key
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.6124	ok; then so have your script execute; and then use crontab to execute it from the OS every two hours; that would be the easiest way to do it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	????
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; you could set a timer for example to refresh your API keys
	0.116	0.564	0.32	0.7096	You’re better off using `crontab` over keeping script running. Better chances of it running successfully because a long-running process can die for a lot of reasons
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or a slightly more complete example for a recurring timer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/24488061/69893>
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.1513	if you really want to get complex, you can write a daemon; and hook into systemd or something to run
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	other options could be using signals, and trapping `SIGHUP`, and using a cronjob to send a `kill -HUP $(pgrep APPNAME)`; and have your signal handle in your python app to refresh API keys on receiving a HUP
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.2732	at that point may as well just run the script with cron itself ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.801	0.199	0.5773	cron isn't going to kill your script if it runs perpetually, it'll just spawn another instance
	0.3	0.7	0.0	-0.7184	Ah, sorry should have added that if you run it with cron to kill using `Timer`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But what if he wants to run it on Windows? Task Scheduler?
	0.096	0.904	0.0	-0.1531	No, linux; I put my script in cron for test, but I think cron don’t close old script ?
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.4019	Your script should terminate when it is done. If you make it loop forever, you have a problem.
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	yes, loop forever, because export some data for monitoring over API
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.7906	Maybe it's better to use the Timer-based solutions suggested above, and use `supervisord` to make sure the script always runs (and is restarted if it ends for whatever reason). In that case you don't have to use a cron job.; Also, do the API keys expire on certain fixed times, or exactly two hours after they have been generated?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	API expires after 2 hours of starting script
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How does the API provider know when you start your script? Does the script ask for keys when it starts for the first time?
	0.063	0.86	0.077	0.128	Yes, script do first get request and then give some code which I use in params when doing new request to API. After 2 hours this code expires and my export of data stop.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you continually hitting an API and just need the re-register of the API key to run every 2 hours?
	0.0	0.7	0.3	0.2828	Yes, but I have while loop forever !
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Tristan> but between getting the new API keys you are running other requests, correct? Also, what site is this? There may be a way to get longer API keys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Joe, I get this code from api and then I request one api every 15 seconds in  loop  and parsing response. After 2 hours code expires and my loop don’t have response. This is proxmox KVM virtualization.
	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.8074	ah okay, yeah then the previous mentions of daemonizing the process is probably your best bet
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	crontab?
	0.134	0.758	0.108	-0.5974	Hey, versioning and giving my commits build numbers is something I've neglected for a while. How should I go about it? I'm using Mercurial + Kiln currently, and I know there is a tag system which can help out with that but I'm just not sure where to begin. Isn't the best practice to have something like `&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;hotfix&gt;.&lt;build&gt;`? Also, is there a way to make this automatically generated?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I prefer to make my versioning explicit... at least the major/minor/hotfix slots. It's not usually practical for an automated system to know whether a given change is API-breaking or not, after all
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.5719	It really depends on what you're making. If it's a web app or API, then build numbers should be fine. However for a library you do want explicit versioning. Some ci solutions allow you to have a manual intervention point
	0.085	0.78	0.136	0.128	<@Gabriele> <@Beula> Thanks, I'll think about what exactly it is I'm doing. I think manual versioning is the way to go for now, and ignore tagging commits.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I do tag commits... it's just a manual process for me, or facilitated with git-flow or whatever
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	General question, that came up in the TestPodcast slack group: what preferred docstring format do people use? reStructuredText, Google, etc?
	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.3089	Shouldn't the math.pow arguments be the other way around?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hey guys, I'm trying to run Docker (with a Debian image) on a Mac. My Python installation on Mac has case-sensitive imports but not in Docker, and this is breaking the `queue` module which has both `queue` and `Queue`. I'm guessing the Python build on Mac deals with Mac having case-insensitive file system but in Docker it's a Debian build so it doesn't, but because Docker is using case-insensitive file system, it causes issue. Is there any way around this?
	0.0	0.978	0.022	0.0772	<@Kiersten> <@Beula> The issue is that I want to pass the field name to a generic function so it can be used to filter on any field name. <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole/blob/master/pypihole/pypihole.py> See the counts_client and _counts_generic functions. (line 62 and 69-70 in particular)  I do access the namedtuple with the entry.client and such wherever possible, of course. But, I don't think that is possible here.
	0.0	0.853	0.147	0.6297	reStructeredText here but i have used google and numpy before; numpy is really nice to use when having to make ML researchers document their code.; <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.4019	interesting; I do the default pycharm (reStructuredText) too

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That packaged didn't work for me because I am yielding a generator and need the state vs just re-calling the function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	aha
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.5096	the short is I am hitting a few APIs with `requests` that do pagination, and sometimes they give random 502s because their SLA isn't great
	0.165	0.722	0.113	0.0	for a second i thought that was a joke class telling people to leave you alone when you were coding
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think the `pow` is right <@Gabriele> - the retry count^backoff-factor; is that not the normal way to do it?; for my case, it goes from 10s, 21s, 33s
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm, I guess
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://github.com/h2non/riprova>; <@Beula>
	0.0	0.4	0.6	0.4588	ooh, that’s neat
	0.053	0.917	0.031	-0.4291	<@Junita> I did more research on my problem. It seems on Mac/Windows, Python enforces case-sensitivity with import at compilation. Because I run Debian in Docker on Mac, Python does not enforce case-sensitivity (it's Debian) but the filesystem is not case sensitive, so import does not distinguish cases. One of my dependencies uses `queue`, which internally imports `Queue`. Without case-sensitivity, it causes circular import, where `queue` imports itself. There are others reporting this type of issue: <https://forums.docker.com/t/python-import-source-files-from-docker-volumns-can-not-distinct-upper-lower-cases-in-lib-name/20527> . I worked around this with a very ugly hack, by appending the path of `Queue` at the front of `sys.path` right before a call that results in `queue` getting imported, and then I delete the path from `sys.path` after. I only need this for development so it seems to be OK.
	0.121	0.821	0.059	-0.34	I’d be shocked if there’s a case mistake in the python standard library.  It was Queue in Python 2, and is queue in Python 3 - are you sure perhaps it’s not an issue of the python version?
	0.141	0.687	0.172	0.223	Looks like there is some platform-specific case-handling behavior (PEP 235) and it predates things like Docker, so maybe it's not surprising it gets confused
	0.039	0.961	0.0	-0.1154	Right but the general issue for people using Docker on Mac is that it’s “Linux” so the file system isn’t case-sensitive.  This isn’t so much a Docker issue as an issue of people being exposed to a case-sensitive file-system
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think the `queue` is for backwards compatibility for 3 to 2; ; The import on line 6 is circular without case-sensitivity
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.3527	Well there is a class Queue in the Queue module, maybe that’s messing it up?   What happens if you do `from Queue import Queue`?
	0.053	0.778	0.169	0.7269	The issue was, that small piece of code tries to import `Queue`, while it itself is `queue`, which effectively allows code to import python2 `Queue` even though they refer to python3 `queue`; But it broke without case-sensitivity; The actualy implementation of `Queue` is perfectly fine
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh - is your python file itself named queue.py?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There is a queue module (basically the code I pasted), I think it's a dependency from another package; Probably just to bridge python 3 and 2
	0.222	0.693	0.085	-0.5514	<@Margy> did you get your problem figured out?  could you share how you tried to import things?  This shouldn’t be a problem

	0.04	0.821	0.14	0.81	Hey, I've been working with python lately, and I think I have most of the basic stuff down, but I'm kinda lost as to where to go moving forward, and so I wanted to ask if there was any advice for going 'beyond the basics', and really getting confident with python and everything it has to offer. Thanks!

	0.0	0.574	0.426	0.6369	Haha, yep. I was looking at general structure vs details 
	0.074	0.817	0.109	0.2244	Hi guys! Anyone who knows how to set up queued or delayed mails in django? Kind of like how you do in Laravel
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	<@Zackary> have you looked at something like django-celery?
	0.031	0.861	0.108	0.7569	<@Junita> No - I will have a look at it. Thanks!; <@Junita> btw, do you know anything about best practice for using environment vars in Django? It’s very easy with Laravel, pulling the env vars from a .env file… But django doenst seem to do it that way.  So far, I have just placed an env.py file in the root of the project, and imported it into my settings.py.
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.2617	yeah I actually wrote a little tool to simplify doing that in my python projects: <https://github.com/jimjkelly/yaep>; but the basics if you don’t want anything fancy is just `os.getenv(KEY, default)`; oh, and loading the `.env` file I suppose
	0.0	0.172	0.828	0.5859	Okay, thanks <@Junita>
	0.087	0.612	0.301	0.6369	Yeah, pip was happy, confirmed that all of my dependencies are there too. I am puzzled
	0.135	0.706	0.159	0.2023	I'm using Flask and have fallen victim to the surprisingly common circular dependency issue. Do I pretty much have to use an app factory pattern to get around this?
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.2732	<@Thomasina> pretty much, if you have source to look at we may be able to suggest something else, but my guess is the factory is the simplest way
	0.071	0.929	0.0	-0.296	I also found that it helped to avoid various flask extensions, because they would usually mean dragging in a further dependency on the `app` object to implement whatever behavior the extension added
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina> Here is a sample app we deprecated from <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old>
	0.14	0.81	0.05	-0.9476	<@Beula> Well, my current code works, _but_ I'm making use of `from models import *` and using any other method of import fails. I heard that importing like that should generally always be avoided though. I'm not entirely sure why that is (yet) so I'm not sure if it's worth fussing over or if I might as well continue with it as is.; <@Gabriele> I'm using several Flask extensions, but I suppose the issue in this case comes from Flask-SQLAlchemy specifically. I'm wondering why the extensions exist if they're so prone to these problems though? Is the user just expected to use an app factory pattern? I'm surprised that even the most basic Flask tutorials seem to have this issue. The first tutorial I ever did wouldn't run due to a circular import error, even though the tutorial didn't mention any error and seemed to produce the correct results of the app running as if there was no error.
	0.33	0.67	0.0	-0.7096	It's discouraged because it pollutes the namespace with everything from `models`; Including its imports
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for example:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> To be frank the reason I'm using the extension is because it seemed a lot more straightforward to use than SQLAlchemy by itself. Guess I'll have to choose between app factory and that.
	0.148	0.756	0.096	-0.126	I have an app factory, and even that didn't solve all my problems, because various functionality likes to have the app at module-level for decorators, etc
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.431	<@Beula> Despite being a coder for longer than I'd like to specify, I've never had to implement an app factory pattern, and I'm wondering how much learning there would be. I generally learn pretty quickly but I am on a fairly tight schedule.
	0.095	0.905	0.0	-0.296	It depends on if you need to import the app elsewhere to work with it, I usually avoid that (but sometimes you cant)
	0.086	0.71	0.204	0.7713	Also wondering if that is in fact the best move considering what Kylotan said. If implementing the pattern would still leave me with import issues later on...well...it sounds like it could be more efficient to just ditch problematic extensions
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.2023	In those cases, I use an `init_app` in a module that initializes the top level things that need to be decorated by `@app`; I can't say I have had those issues; You just need to pass the app around sometimes during the startup/bootstrap phase
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.3796	The app factory is really simple. Giving it the name 'factory' makes it sound like some sort of complex pattern but really it's just a function that returns a thing.
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	Yeah, I added a link to a thread above <@Thomasina> for reference
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.4336	<@Beula> so to be clear, `init_app` is a method of a module separate from the main module that runs the init code that I'd usually have in my main module, or...?
	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.296	Yeah, it's simply a way to lazily initialize other things that depend on the app object; for example, how I do blueprints: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/blueprints/__init__.py#L7>; And how I do the external dependencies (extensions): <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L28>
	0.109	0.819	0.072	-0.2382	Yes, blueprints. I see most Flask-based projects on GitHub use these but I'm not using them _at all_. I think I'm probably missing something here.
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	blueprints help you keep the `app` out of most of your files
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.5499	yeah, that will cause you issues. But you can do an `init_app` style like this, rather than importing the app directly (which is probably why you have the issue); to get around it temporarily; but blueprints == important
	0.0	0.362	0.638	0.6478	Yeah, they are really helpful
	0.085	0.878	0.038	-0.3612	It's annoying that this stuff is buried towards the back of the Flask docs (if I remember correctly) because I'd contend it's almost impossible to build a non-trivial Flask app without it
	0.0	0.95	0.05	0.2023	<@Gabriele> Ya, it boggles my mind how non-obvious these things are to new users of Flask such as myself. I wasn't even aware these things existed for awhile, never mind that they were at all important.
	0.109	0.591	0.3	0.6369	Unfortunately most blogs and stuff only show happy path projects, few people educate on good patterns
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	relative import; <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references>
	0.082	0.878	0.04	-0.296	Ohhh, I see. Being rather new to Python I hadn't seen that before. Didn't exist in any other language I'd been coding in either. I take it that's something to avoid as well? I think I fell victim to at least a few of those tutorials that have some not-so-good practices mixed in with them
	0.211	0.536	0.253	-0.0772	relative imports are okay, but yeah - generally importing in a function/class/method is discouraged
	0.0	0.527	0.473	0.659	yeah, relative imports themselves are actually quite good
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do imports by themselves generally have a lot of overhead?
	0.333	0.667	0.0	-0.6124	relative imports lets you avoid refactor annoyances with renaming packages and such
	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.4404	you get to be quite explicit about where you are getting stuff from; in the general case I wouldn’t worry about import overhead
	0.074	0.825	0.101	0.3818	<https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Import_Statement_Overhead>; &gt; import statements can be executed just about anywhere. It's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility and/or reduce initial startup time. Although Python's interpreter is optimized to not import the same module multiple times, repeatedly executing an import statement can seriously affect performance in some circumstances.
	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.2732	I imported some APIs within functions because I thought it was kind of wasteful to import - for example - a Yelp, FourSquare, and EventBrite library when only the TicketMaster library would be needed for a certain call to my API, and after learning you can import in functions in Python.
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.4404	It actually does have impact that matters; Ideally you'd only do that at app-startup, not each call (e.g. don't import into an http endpoint handler)
	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.0772	...yeah, I was about to say that. You usually want this sort of thing out of the way at startup time
	0.119	0.829	0.052	-0.504	Wouldn't the result be the same? I mean, at the risk of sounding like an idiot (this is my first PaaS project), every time someone calls my API doesn't `app.py` - in my Procfile: `web: python app.py` - run again and the whole process starts over?
	0.073	0.927	0.0	-0.296	no; At least not usually. Python servers, including Flask, are typically long-running processes. They sit waiting for requests, and when they've finished with one, they wait for the next
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.6124	you also want to use gunicorn (or a different interface server); don't use the flask devserver for prod; but the way some of those work is as <@Gabriele> said. Some will restart a subprocess after it's handled some number of requests to limit memory growth, or something similar
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`python app.py` suggests you are
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Well...yes...I think I am. I guess when I was brand new and just starting the project I somehow thought that Heroku would take of the server stuff...guess that doesn't make much sense.. whoops
	0.048	0.899	0.054	-0.3716	It's fine in the short term if you're still developing or have a tiny number of users, but you'll probably want to test in a 'proper' config sooner rather than later to verify that everything still works; For example, we had big problems when we moved our Flask app to Elastic Beanstalk because it has its own particular way that it expects Flask apps to be structured, which didn't match our existing setup
	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.7964	So - and I still can't believe I didn't already realize this - Heroku runs my project on a server but it's truly a bare server without any HTTP functionality for example, which is why something like gunicorn is needed, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they have a load balancer in front
	0.071	0.929	0.0	-0.296	No, it's more that Flask has its own built-in HTTP server that is not designed to run at scale, just to service your local developer requests and that's about it
	0.29	0.71	0.0	-0.5994	no; Without the flask server or gunicorn running, heroku would show an error page
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Go here, scroll down to "The Web Server": <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xviii-deployment-on-the-heroku-cloud>
	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.25	<@Gabriele> Haha, I had learned a lot of what I know from that tutorial but hadn't gone through the whole thing. Guess I should've taken time to do the _whole_ thing.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats why you need to have somethign up front to separate into processes and handle concurrent requests
	0.0	0.494	0.506	0.9365	<@Meg> Wow. That's a super clear explainer! Thanks!; <@Meg> So gunicorn takes care of this process splitting and such?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats what you need gunicorn for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i’ve used the factory pattern and blueprints since the beginning with many extensions and never had any issues.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Any preferred web hotels to use for hosting django?
	0.119	0.597	0.284	0.5106	And is the benefit of using blueprints solely to help with avoiding circular import issues?
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.8225	if you don’t have a lot of experience with all that stuff I’d say Heroku can be a good first step; as matt said, infrastructure as a service makes things nice and easy
	0.055	0.804	0.141	0.5267	<@Thomasina> - no, blueprints are just a good way to break up your app into components and separate concerns.; They can help with the import issue since you decorate the route with `@bp.route` instead of `@app.route` though
	0.0	0.698	0.302	0.7479	<@Beula> the breaking up an app into components thing sounds like good OOP really. So blueprints somehow extend this concept?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd say it's more about general modularity than OOP
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.6652	I am not familiar with that one, but it looks like they probably build on top of blueprints and you have to register the `api` with your app
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	Ah, no you use `Api(app)` or `api = Api(); api.init_app(app)`; That is what I was looking for
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	; api = Api(app) is registering api with app, no?
	0.037	0.911	0.051	0.1872	Ah, yes, that's right. I guess it's the "you have to register the `api` with your app"...this is what I'm already doing, right? I'm not sure if it was meant that I need to do this (e.g. I haven't done it) or if it's just being stated that I was required to do this...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	to do this with a blueprint you can do:    
	0.0	0.708	0.292	0.931	<@Johana> Oh nice! Thanks for the example! Makes a lot more sense to me now.; So I guess I should dive into learning to implement gunicorn, blueprints, and app factory patterns now. Thanks for the help guys! I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.5927	i haven’t updated this in a while but it’s a good approach to using blueprints and app factory pattern. <https://github.com/mikefromit/real_world_flask>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Here is another take, but it's a cookiecutter so slightly less obvious to read: <https://github.com/mrasband/cookiecutter-flask>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mine is slightly based off mattupstates blog article <http://mattupstate.com/blog/how-i-structure-my-flask-applications/>; i asked him tons of questions about his structure in the #pocoo channel on irc.; this was when i was learning flask. i don’t use everything he does.
	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.4019	I guess adding a procfile to either/both would help newbies that use heroku, even if they don't use heroku it at least shows the "prod command"
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.8625	flask project structure is interesting and i have found that even my own has evolved over time as i pick up new conventions. i do run several flask apps in production for my organization. one of them runs our biglearn platform and is very similar to the link i posted.; it powers this guy: <https://openstax.org/openstax-tutor>; i don’t mention that to toot my own horn. i just happen to love flask and i want to assure everyone that it can run enterprise level stuff.
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	Yeah it's not possible
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Noemi> are you running the tests in both instances from the root of the api_tests folder?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have a set of UI tests structured the same way using pytest and selenium, I don't have this issue with those
	0.149	0.752	0.099	-0.4926	Guys, hi I have searched for it a little bit, but still dont find information  When I write a custom path in django logging settings like ‘filename’: ‘logs/main.log’ a error occur saying that there is no such file  Am I really should create it manually? Or there is a way it can be done automatically, if no such file exist?
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.5499	i had many ideas for it initially but it was pushed up mainly to help someone who had a project structure question.
	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.1531	<@Ciera> re: github api   did you find out if you can invite a user to a team if they haven't joined the organization yet?
	0.084	0.855	0.062	-0.0387	<@Noemi> no clue. but I would suggest you have your dev and deployment environments on the same OS; and if you can't, use docker or vagrant to do so; then you would avoid OS-distinct issues like this; A possible exception would be Java webapps where you're using Tomcat/Jetty/some other container
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6124	<@Junita> yes, root of the directory; Just noticed a hint on the pytest output saying to make sure modules/packages have valid python names. What makes them invalid names?
	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.7184	my guess is there’s something different about the environment, which beyond the general wisdom of OS issues would ensure that general setup is the same (python version, dependency versions, etc)
	0.109	0.81	0.081	-0.1779	Hmm alright, I guess I'll have to keep looking into it; Same error when I execute the python file directly without the pytest runner
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	to a degree that makes sense, `base` is not in the same directory; test runners will usually do a little magic to make all this work though
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	Yeah, the same approach works in my other test suite
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That shouldn't be something I need to do manually though right?
	0.058	0.866	0.076	0.128	no it often is taken care of automatically, but I haven’t really used pytest much because I’m a relic and nobody told me that nose wasn’t a thing anymore
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	ah, yeah, that might do it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But again, I don't know why the same isn't happening with my other test suite
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is the other test suite within the same hierarchy?
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.8646	<@Detra> has a book about testing with pytest, maybe worth the look.; The way I like to do pytest allows you to test your app without installing it, and after installing it - so you get a pretty nice dev workflow
	0.103	0.687	0.21	0.4215	I am pretty sure I found the problem, and it comes back to forgetting the shebang since I wrote the code originally on windows....
	0.076	0.859	0.065	-0.1027	Anyone have an idea if there's a way to block the width of the console using Python? I'm currently coding a text-based game and I would like to don't let the user change the sizes of the console/terminal.

	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.68	Hello, everyone! I’m learning Python and working on a personal project. Does anyone know and/or could point to the appropriate source how to build a Facebook share-like button with all the functionalities behind it? Meaning: if some blogsite has a list of blog posts and users have their own profile pages, by clicking on a share-like button below a blog post, the summarized blog post gets saved to her/his profile page. Thank you.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Tristan>  That last way will work, if you do the expression the right way around; `time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time`; another way is just to wrap your usual requests in a function that will request the new API key and re-request if necessary
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4678	<@Gabriele> How to integrate that in   The best way is to restart whole script after 2 hours, but I don’t want to use cron. Do you have some idea ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wrap that script in another script that re-runs it until it's killed?; and just have the inner script quit out after 2 hours. Although I don't see why you need to restart the script
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How to integrate  in my while loop ?
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.4019	How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)
	0.112	0.813	0.075	-0.4215	Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`; And in the loop, before each request: ; You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	kylotan, thank you.
	0.185	0.679	0.136	-0.3382	(also, test it with a number like 60, so you don't have to wait 2 hours to see if it's correct or not!); No problem.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3802	cool !
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	you could probably improve the code by setting that time inside the get_key function, so that you don't need it in the if statement
	0.0	0.56	0.44	0.6696	yes, I thinking about that. Thank you <@Gabriele> I will test !
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina> I'm guessing it is probably module:function
	0.559	0.441	0.0	-0.6202	Not sure what I'm doing wrong.

	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.5075	<@Suellen> I'm not sure, but checking on Heroku the `app` folder does indeed contain my application and there is no `migrations` folder in it even though the log up there says otherwise.; So if I run the Python scripts while inside bash on the server it works perfectly...weird
	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.296	I suppose this is one of the reasons why I'd avoid managed PAAS if possible; DO/AWS over Heroku
	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.6908	true, AWS/DO require you to have a good amount of knowledge/time to learn beforehand; and that's a selling point of heroku
	0.045	0.834	0.121	0.6393	Ya, that's true; So, after reading up I _think_ I kinda get _what_ a blueprint is now, except I don't really understand _why_ one should use blueprints. All the examples seem to show either very abstract things or super simple things that don't seem to benefit from a blueprint as far as I can understand.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have separate blueprints for standard view routes, for JSON APIs, and for admin and testing APIs. I can quickly turn off the whole admin and testing APIs by commenting out the single line that attaches that blueprint; I can also mount all the routes in one blueprint with a different URL path with just one change
	0.0	0.755	0.245	0.6369	yeah I actually have all of my blueprints feature toggleable by environment variables; and essentially the benefit is modularity
	0.077	0.836	0.087	0.0772	I see. Then, I suppose the difficulty I'm having is in understanding how I can use them in my own project. Hopefully it will become clearer after I learn more about them.
	0.05	0.88	0.07	0.1779	_How_ to use them is very straightforward. The docs show that. _Why_ to use them is trickier, until you have done enough big projects that you start valuing modularity from the start.
	0.043	0.762	0.195	0.881	Yes, I do value modularity greatly but always felt that the package -&gt; class -&gt; property/method approach was comprehensive enough. Naturally I'm trying to think of something similar to blueprints in any other language but the examples I see for blueprints seem like things that - to me - in any other language could be done just as easily with classes.; And since Python has classes and the like this confuses me.
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.4019	blueprints aren't a language feature, they're a Flask feature; It's giving you a way to make a Flask app out of smaller sub-apps that you might want to mix and match, or change independently; (assuming we're talking about Flask blueprints and not some other blueprints... just noticed we're not in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>)
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.2144	I think an important point is that if you don’t see the need, you don’t need to use them.  It’s worth exploring them to know they’re there, but you’ll know when you need them.
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.6662	Yes, I meant Flask. "Sub-apps"? So would you perhaps say that this is a way of building an app, but having different parts of the app actually be different apps, where each one is coded like an individual Flask app, and then everything is "plugged in" to each other?
	0.122	0.778	0.1	-0.1027	If everything is working fine without them for you, there’s no need to over-engineer your project.
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.5499	they're not entirely 'sub-apps' but they are modular parts of a larger app, yes.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Junita> If I don't implement them now though, and my Flask API grows in complexity over time, will it be a major headache when the time comes to use blueprints though?
	0.019	0.862	0.119	0.8687	So one example is that as <@Gabriele> and I said, it’s quite easy to “turn on” and “turn off” a blueprint - I literally do it based on the presence of environment variables.; so for example when I launched a product we had an Invite system; which was a blueprint, and we were able to turn on and off the need for invites via a simple environment variable change, no need to rebuild and redeploy.; that’s perhaps a pretty niche example of a concrete use though - I really think the modularity is the real benefit.; Things just are cleaner and easier to work with, reason about, etc. when working with them, in my opinion.   But that’s a bit more subjective
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Would that be very different from a simple `if os.environ['INVITE_PAGE'] == 1:` in the code for the endpoint where the page would be though?
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.2732	Right, as well as any other associated stuff you’ve done.
	0.035	0.923	0.042	0.128	I'm using Flask-Restful which means that the various methods for endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, etc.) are grouped into classes. However it does feel a bit messy since that means `/users/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/`, `/users/auth/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/requests/` and others all have their own classes (some with similar names...I mean how am I supposed to meaningfully differentiate the first two by name?). I'm wondering if this setup could benefit from blueprints in some way.
	0.142	0.71	0.148	0.0258	Maybe.  I only briefly messed with Flask Restful so I’m not too familiar with it.
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.4098	I'm wondering if anyone even uses Flask-Restful for complex APIs, or if it's generally only used for simple ones.; Gonna use this <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Testing/> and wondering if it's ok to put my testing code within my app's main script, or if it should be in its own script; So, in its own module then?; `print(__name__)` would print the name of the current...method?...module?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It should be the module. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So if my primary application script is `app.py` and I have `app = Flask(__name__)` I suppose I'm setting it to `app` then? I'd test but my code is in the middle of a major change so I can't run it.
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	Yes, unless you're running the app.py file directly
	0.0	0.724	0.276	0.6369	It's best to explicitly replace `__name__` with a string in the Flask initializer
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	testing code should be outside the app
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4939	i use flask-restplus and from what i understand it is inspired from flask-restful.; I believe using a `class` and inheriting from Resource is a the same pattern.
	0.0	0.934	0.066	0.2263	I usually have my tests in a separate directory alongside the package for the main app. But I don't use Flask-Testing or any other extension so I don't know what that recommends.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	 So this should not be in the production code, otherwise it'll run the Flask dev server, right?
	0.079	0.857	0.064	-0.1027	No that is fine, that only runs if you directly call `python file.py`; But if you use gunicorn, `gunicorn file:app` it would not run the devserver
	0.064	0.904	0.033	-0.3595	Ah, ok. gunicorn runs a specific function unlike Python which runs the entire script...I should've noticed that. Thanks!; <@Beula> In <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/> you have `pyslackers.__main__:app` in `Dockerfile` but in `__main__.py` there is no `app` function. Instead `app` is a variable as in `app = create_app(resolve_config(os.getenv('PY_ENV', 'dev')))`. How does that work?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Gunicorn uses that as the WSGI gateway, it's the "callable" for the spec; So `app` is a `Flask` instance, and that is a callable (per how wsgi works)
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.3412	you don't have to worry too much about it fortunately - just enough
	0.07	0.809	0.121	0.599	Oh, really? Good to know. Thanks!; Wow. Ya, I expected it to be quite a bit more complicated. Makes sense!; By the way, you have `from pyslackers import create_app, models` in __main__.py but there is no `pyslackers` module...?; I'm thinking maybe this is from running __main__.py directly, and perhaps I need a script to run from the parent folder that acts as the true primary script, but I'm not sure
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`pyslackers` is the package the whole app is in; `create_app` is from `pyslackers.__init__`; models is another module
	0.086	0.864	0.049	-0.296	<@Beula> Oh ok, that's what I thought but for some reason when I run my app - Broadway - locally with Python I get "No module named broadway" from the line `from broadway import create_app`
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.1901	yeah, you want `python -m broadway`; the `-m` runs it as a module, executing `__main__.py`; but it sets the PYTHONPATH to be the CWD
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	I am at a ruby job and avoid it a lot
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.9059	Haha, while initially I wasn't crazy about Python, the more I learn about it the more I like it, and one of those reasons is that I feel it can be very efficient, to create all kinds of things rather quickly
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.4019	I think I may be slightly non-standard in that regard. But since `flask` introduced the CLI, I have been liking this approach.; For aiohttp apps, it made it so I could just have an optional CLI to run the application
	0.103	0.897	0.0	-0.1531	flask introduced a CLI?  heh.  here I’ve been making a manage.py entry point for all these years.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea it uses click now.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I suppose that makes sense.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh wait...do I not need `manage.py` for my DB deployment then?
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	the click cli in flask supports it.; <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/cli/#custom-scripts>
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6597	it’s funny because I’ve been meaning to go through the Flask docs again because I knew there were probably a ton of things like that which have changed over the years.
	0.0	0.538	0.462	0.7184	It's pretty nice, for example with the `flask-migrate` extension:   
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.5256	So I can use this to make deployment more elegant than having to run `python manage.py db init`, `python manage.py db migrate`, and `python manage.py db upgrade` separately?
	0.241	0.426	0.333	0.0772	yeah I was always writing that stuff myself like a sucker
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.296	Yeah, you can make a custom command that does those for you; `db init`, if using flask-migrate, is only a 1 time thing though, just setting up the local config and migrations folder; so neither `db migrate` nor `db init` would be needed during deployment
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.3919	I do the upgrade/run at boot each time so it's always up to date for prod ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; but init is one time ever for a project, and migrate creates the migrations; so I don't think you need those often enough, those are developer run manually
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.6808	Ah, ok.; Good point; In `__main__.py`, `from broadway import create_app` results in `No module named 'broadway'`... Hmm... It's definitely the right name
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how are you running it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`python -m broadway`; From the module's parent directory
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and the dirs are:   ?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	python2 or 3?; delete out your __pycache__ dirs
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.2023	Oh, there is a `__pycache__` at the top level too - do you have an `__init__.py` in the `backend` dir?; That would cause it
	0.127	0.873	0.0	-0.1531	Oh, no but there used to be. It became my Broadway module.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this pushed somewhere, or a work thing?
	0.055	0.748	0.197	0.5574	Yeah, I was just hoping to see the code to look for anything funky; hmm; and `pwd` has you in the `backend` directory?
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	Could such a thing be cause by a circular import error?; Yep
	0.056	0.944	0.0	-0.4019	So I commented out lines one by one as you said and found the problem line. It's `app.config.from_object(config)`. The way I have this set up is that I pass in `os.environ['APP_SETTINGS']` which contains the relevant configuration class (e.g. `broadway.config.DevelopmentConfig`), and it's this that's throwing the error. I've tried without `broadway` and without `broadway.` but neither of those are working. Before modulizing this I just used `config.DevelopmentConfig` which worked.
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	The error is now related to config, not imports?
	0.418	0.582	0.0	-0.81	No, still the same error, but if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config)` in `__init__.py` I no longer receive any errors
	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.6597	yeah, sounds like you just need to change how the config is resolved
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	try relatives for anything other than `__main__`, `from . import config, util`
	0.156	0.816	0.028	-0.6154	Guess I spoke too soon. I'm not even sure what's going on now. I'm not sure if the line in `models.py` is relevant at all. I just can't get `app.config.from_object()` to work no matter what I provide it with.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Even a raw class?
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	Yep. `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` causes `NameError: name 'config' is not defined`
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	is config imported?; sounds like not
	0.15	0.809	0.041	-0.6705	Well, I thought that was the issue, so I tried adding `import config` and now I'm back to the old error `No module named 'broadway'`, referring to `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py`, and if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` the error no longer occurs.
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	`from . import config` is probably better
	0.23	0.592	0.178	-0.2023	Oh, my bad. Yes it's `from . import external, config` in `__init__.py`
	0.149	0.638	0.213	0.128	It sounds like you still have a bad import somewhere, something external or config or something like that import
	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.4019	Changing `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py` to `from . import create_app, models, util` changes the error to `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_app'`
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	yeah, because it's trying to import a module, not a function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	When should I use `from broadway` vs. `from .`? I didn't know there was a difference actually
	0.038	0.86	0.102	0.6196	you _should_ be able to use `from broadway` everywhere, but I am not sure what is causing you issues ATM. the `.` is a "relative" import so it just removes any ambiguity of which package you're talking about; But you can't do relatives in something like `__main__` because the `broadway` package isn't initted yet, or something like that; <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime> <@Margareta>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can still have a manage.py.
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.3612	hi guys what would b the correct the print out date with letters instead of digits as month using datetime  I’d like to see  `2017-Jul-13` instead
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`datetime.date.today().strftime('%Y-%b-%d')`
	0.0	0.542	0.458	0.5229	thank u <@Beula> and <@Minerva> !!!
	0.121	0.83	0.048	-0.4871	I placed some `print()`s at certain points to see if things were actually executing. After running `python -m broadway` I can see...; `created app` prints _after_ `app = create_app(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])` runs; Why was there no error at the beginning? Is this behaviour normal?
	0.214	0.733	0.053	-0.8355	python executes as it reads; I am kind of dumb, but in this case with flask you can do:  `FLASK_APP=broadway/__main__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`; No need for the python -m and such (though that looks like windows, not sure how the flask CLI work sthere); Sorry for sending you on a chase on accident
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh? Was I on a chase?
	0.194	0.806	0.0	-0.3818	No, I meant this whole refactor with the `__main__` and such; It's hard when I can't review the code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it working?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	probably a flask devserver oddity
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.2732	Well, that never would have occurred to me. I'll have to remember that.
	0.565	0.435	0.0	-0.0772	sorry man
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	after spinning for an hour or so
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you give a sample of how you are registering your blueprints?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how are you registering routes
	0.095	0.839	0.065	-0.3506	That's probably your only option if there's no unofficial source either. Be sure to check that you aren't breaking their terms of service with that, however. Scraping is often times okay, but some sites explicitly forbid it - especially if intending to resell the info
	0.03	0.97	0.0	-0.2144	anybody know how I can use jquery to target specific elements that Django automatically brings up?; specifically I'm trying to click on a button if the Django generic form error element is visible to the user, but targeting the element directly always brings up the modal that is triggered by the button, or doesn't trigger at all if I use the visible selector 
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.743	it all depends on what you like.; i prefer to stay as close to a function as possible before creating a class. however, there are great times to use a class and really depends on the use case. if you offer up some examples or ideas of what you are trying to do maybe someone has a way they have done it before.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i don't understand the 2nd elif condition 
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.7351	<@Reina> in `for i in a:`, i takes the value of actual elements in `a`: ie: 1, 1, 2, 3, ... , 89; that '2nd elif' is simply comparing the user's input `choice` to whatever value `i` has during that iteration. If `choice &gt; i` (ie: user's input = choice = 10, and it is the for loop's first iteration, i will have value of 1), then append `1` to `my_list`
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	now i got it; Thanks
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	yep; :+1:

	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.1531	now i want to understand this code and also want to make such program even more simple which i can understand  
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.8885	I would presume you'd want to use the range `(1, n)`, the round brackets mean non-inclusive, so if `n` is 5 you'd want to test the in the range `2,3,4`, versus what you have `[1,n]` which means inclusive, so the range `1,2,3,4,5`.; As for simplifying it, it's already reasonably straight forward. Alternate approaches could be changing your `list = ` statement to `filter(lambda d: not n % d, range(2, n))`.; You'd also want to check that the input is a positive number, you can use `abs(n)` to ensure it's absolute; And as an aside, don't shadow builtins. `list` is a builtin, and you're shadowing over that name with your `list = ` assignment.
	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.0772	prime number factorization?
	0.357	0.643	0.0	-0.6124	I would drop the try/except block with: ; Whole thing maybe redone as:

	0.051	0.892	0.057	-0.1491	I'm currently learning how to use modules and call other files. It's is possible to have a file named(main.py) and call another file(ship.py). And from ship.py execute a function in main.py Sorry if I'm not explaining clear enough.; From the function main.py I want to execute some code of the file ship.py and also I want to do it the other way, from ship.py I want to execute functions of main.py
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Chery> this is called a 'circular import', and that's generally prohibited
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	`main.py` sounds like an entry point, why would you import something from it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'll search about it
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.5719	Yeah malinoff, that was my idea, but at main.py I have a function to create a delay_print and I also want to use it at ship.py
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4215	as long as you don't do `from main import some_other_function` and `from ship import some_function` you won't have circular import issues. Although the import semantics have changed in Py3.x to help prevent circular imports
	0.241	0.536	0.223	-0.0516	<@Carri>  Like this it gives me an error
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	<@Chery> Restructuring your code would help
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Chery> then move `delay_print` into `ship.py`; And do `from ship import delay_print`
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.296	<@Collette> Yeah, that would work, and what about if I put this functions in another file and call them?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Chery> you don't "call files" in python. You _import_ things from _modules_ and _packages_; <http://bit.ly/pypackages>
	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.296	People there will see it, pointing it out isn't far off of cross posting. You only been to point it out if there's no action for a while

	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.296	<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dhl_shipping/2.0.4>; Yeah, I haven't worked on similar project before, so there are quite few things I need to figure out before development.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In first loop hcf is 1, next it gets overwritten with 2, next 3, next 6, hcf variable will continue to hold 6 until the loop hits 24
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it will give you all the numbers
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just declare hcf=[] before the for loop
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	You would also need to do hcf.append(i), can't just assign to it if you want it to remain a list.

	0.094	0.847	0.06	-0.849	So, I have an import error that I've been trying to solve (with help from here) for the past two days and still haven't been able to solve. I'm building a REST API and I've put my source into its own module titled `broadway`. I'm implementing an app factory pattern. In `__main__.py` I have `from broadway import create_app, models, util`, and `create_app` is defined in `__init__.py`. These are the entire contents of `__init__.py`:  When running my application locally with `python -m broadway` the application returns the following error: `from broadway import create_app, models, util - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'broadway'`; Strangely commenting out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` fixes the error. This is not a real solution of course since then my app is missing vital configuration info. Also, in this example the parameter (`config.DevelopmentConfig`) is hard-coded as originally `config_data` was passed to it but I changed it to make sure the data being passed wasn't the actual issue.; I just don't get how the line in `__init__.py` relates to the import error at all.; Also, I put a bunch of `print()`s throughout my code to see what was going on. They _all_ printed, even the ones after the actual `create_app` function runs in `__main__.py`.; It was suggested that this was a problem with the Flask development server. After running my app with the Flask CLI it launched without errors. Then the problem was that all the endpoints of my API returned 404s, even though there were no errors in the actual Python reported (Flask's debug mode was on).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`python -m unittest discover`   What this command do?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hi,
	0.0	0.526	0.474	0.4019	Hi is anyone active ?
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	Does sitting down class as active?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	&gt; dont seem to be scaling up Can you explain?
	0.106	0.825	0.069	-0.8422	They give a number 954311 and the largest number that is divisible is 94311; The length of the number can be up 10 digits long.; Mine works perfectly up to 6 but beyond that I think there is an error; My latest attempt was the fastest to execute but failed 4 of 5 tests. I don't get the error from them so I dont know why it failed.; In other attempts it ran slower (I built a set of permutations) and passed 4 out 5 tests.; Knowing that the number of digits in the list can grow up to 10.. my guess is it's not scaling up properly.
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.0772	Tell me what your code does when the number isnt divisible  by 3; In your own words
	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.0772	If the number is not divisible by three it increments down one and checks the next one if that is divisible by three.
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.3612	Ok. What if the number "decrement by one" cant be made with the numbers in the list?
	0.04	0.841	0.119	0.4767	Let me explain more.  First I take the list of numbers and I sort them high to low.  I join the values together, appending one to the other.; So 5,3,4,1,2 becomes 5,4,3,2,1 then 54321; I then iterate down from the 54321 until I find the first number divisible by 3.; then I return that
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2144	Yes. So your list is [5,4,3,2,1] but 54320 wouldnt be possible because 0 isnt in your list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The range gives me the iteratable. At that point the list is gone.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Exactly
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	I do see the number increment down and I do get a return result that is divisible by 3.
	0.079	0.762	0.158	0.4019	Ok walk me through the problem in just words and you doing it by hand. Dont use your code.  ; If i give you the list [2,2,2,2,7], what is your process?
	0.046	0.885	0.07	-0.0258	let's use [8,7,2,6,4] as the 2's will hide some steps; so I need to turn that in to 87642; then find the largest number that is equal to or less then that number and is divisible by 3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Lets use [8,7,3,6,2] since the largest num isnt divisible by 3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's the point.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Exactly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It has to be closest to or equal.
	0.219	0.692	0.09	-0.4329	So, whats the next number you try?; After 87643 fails, then what?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my code is stepping down to 87641, then 87640, etc..; checking each for % 3 == 0; AH!
	0.17	0.692	0.138	-0.128	Ok, is 87642 a valid answer to the problem where the input is [8,7,6,4,3]?
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.4995	I realize where I made one mistake..; OK the number has to use all numbers in the set..; Let me show you my other approach if you don't mind.
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	&gt; finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits 
	0.044	0.921	0.035	-0.1531	In this approach. I take all the numbers in the set and create every permutation from them. Then increment through the new list in descending order.; In this one, I filter the list to remove duplicates.; I also break up the sets by length because I hit a memory limit error on submission. In that case the first hit for 954311 is 94311.
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	Good. Your on the right track. 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
	0.0	0.801	0.199	0.6666	Large numbers will have a LOT of permutations. So it's probably best to load them lazily rather than making a set
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it could be a memory error.. they don't specially say..
	0.0	0.719	0.281	0.5106	It could also be an issue with string sorting vs number sorting :)
	0.346	0.61	0.044	-0.886	when I created one big set for all permutations that's when i got the memory error. but this code runs it just fails test 4 and I get no error
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.0772	You might want to try converting every sting into an int before sorting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That makes sense.; data_set = map(int, data_set)  should take of that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ya, i think so
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Madaline> why are you using set in line 10?
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	what about something like (note: you'd have to re-write to get it to work with a list of numbers as input) 
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.3724	I had started with a similar approach but their verification tool was not reporting errors properly.
	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.0772	<@Madaline> sorry, didnt see the new one.
	0.026	0.904	0.07	0.6124	code that ran perfectly in my Jupyter was failing.. So split it up and simplified it .; This approach looks much better then what I was doing.; This is what I originally tried but I hit memory errors.; In case anyone is interested in triggering the Google code challenge. I've been spending a lot of time searching for Python, crawlers, NLP, analytics, algorithms, etc... This is the second time it came up for me in the last 2 months.. I  was on vacation last time it came up so time ran out.; <@Cleta> I have a quick question about your example. One line 6 there is SUM of the permutation and then you are checking if it is divisible by 3. Then on line 8 your yield is the joined integer. Is this a faster way or an error?
	0.107	0.86	0.033	-0.4442	for one it doesn't look like your code handles the condition: `If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the answer`; two, i like nhumrich's idea to lazily evaluate, which you could do with generators
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^this
	0.329	0.671	0.0	-0.2411	Not sure if that fits
	0.141	0.576	0.283	0.4019	Thank you.. Its funny. I never really have to deal with this type of problem.
	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.2411	not sure if it is faster than modulo-ing the int, that's just what came to mind
	0.0	0.755	0.245	0.3818	I can time it and see if it helps performance
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	<@Madaline>, just doing a modulo a la `if int(''.join(p)) % 3 == 0:` is a little faster, i'm guessing because the other way adds a list comprehension step. good catch
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Shelly>; whats the function of the last line of this code; i see the difference with and without it in the output is this:; Out[1]: [‘English’, ‘Math’, ‘Science’]; What is Out[1]:; ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> It sorts the dictionary based on the keys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what is Out[1]?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis>  it sorts the keys Alphabetically
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	May be you are using some interactive python shell like Jupyter
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so the list() gets it printed automatically?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis>  What tool are you using to write/run the code anyway?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`Sorted` sorts the dictionary based on the keys in increasing order since you are passing the list of keys here, here it is in alphabetical order.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> to elaborate more on <@Shelly> ‘s answer, the function `marks.keys()` returns a list of keys in the dictionary and `sorted()` returns the sorted list. Although why is there a conversion to list when it will return a list anyways?
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.2144	interesting to note is that it doesn’t effect your dictionary in any manner, it will return a list of sorted elements anyways. even if you pass a string to `sorted()` function but if you use the `list.sort()` function , it changes the list.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.7096	Good luck,
	0.0	0.643	0.357	0.6124	Hi, Can someone please help me with installing ipython on mac?
	0.024	0.848	0.128	0.8025	<@Donnetta> sure.   install anaconda which will have everything and won't mess with your system's python.  <https://www.continuum.io/downloads#macos>; It has ipython and so many other libs which you will use eventually.; ipython or jupyter notebook makes a list of inputs (In) and outputs (Out)  so you can reference previous inputs and outputs by doing stuff like:  print(Out[1])   #returns  [‘English’, ‘Math’, ‘Science’]; If you have long lines or large code blocks it can save some scrolling/typing.

Then redirecting the output to a `logfile` and `console` on real time. So I am using `wtee.exe` (ex command: `dir 2&gt;&amp;1 | wtee.exe logFile.txt`).  Choosing `popen` over `os.system` because I need control over the new process (new command prompt)  As I wont be able to use pipe symbol in Popen. I did the below functionality   I can see the log file is generated and also the output in command prompt (on main window and not in new console).  So please help to find out the way how can I print the output in new console opened using subprocess.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Vonnie> And this is the code with mattrasband's suggestions applied: 
	0.0	0.542	0.458	0.8155	let me try it out. Thank you for that. I really appreciate the help.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I did try python 3 earlier but a lot of the scripts/recipes were written in 2.7, so I had to downgrade
	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.5318	Uh-uh. I see.; Well, it's not forbidden to use Python 2 ;-); I used it for 25 years and I'm still using it.
	0.0	0.313	0.687	0.6588	Great! And now?
	0.0	0.812	0.188	0.594	What is your ultimate goal? To extract the tweets from the file?; Oh yeah sure you could extract anything and everything from it
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.4767	Basically I just need to make the file easier to read so I can count the number of tweets, retweets, see who tweets the most, and do a word cloud.
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	<@Vonnie> Ah, you want to do some statistics on the data.
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	Yup. That's what the plan is. I just need to get a better idea of what people are doing and saying
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.4011	Well, counting the tweets is not hard: that's just the number of tweet objects in your stream file.
	0.071	0.892	0.036	-0.3094	Counting the number of retweets is somewhat harder, is that mentioned in the Tweet object? If so, you could fetch it and do something with it. Retweets always belong to one specific tweet, no?
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2732	well i could skip that. just would prefer to see who the most prolific ones are
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4019	You mean, you are only interested in tweets that get a lot of retweets?
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.34	well i am analysing twitter trends. have four big files. want to see who tweets the most, which ones got the most RTs, geotag them, and make a word cloud.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why do you have 4 big files, and not 2 or 6 or 35?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the script i followed didn't give me the option to make smaller ones; so basically i collected a lot of tweets for trends; the four files are for four trends
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ah, every trend gets its own stream file!
	0.0	0.5	0.5	0.4588	Either name works :)
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.3412	<@Vonnie> Dont worry about the file size because the construction 'for line in f: ...' doesn't load the entire file into memory.
	0.238	0.762	0.0	-0.6115	Ahh; So no need to iterate ; Would I be too lazy if I asked someone here how I can do that? 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Vonnie> For example, to show the Twitter users with the most tweets: 
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.7902	Wow; That's really good ; I need to sit down and work on my python skills after September 
	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.7691	<@Vonnie> Yeah it really pays to know the data structures and the common idioms.; I am sure my code can be made even better.; Do you see a bug there? `not interested in people with less than 6 tweets` still, I see a line which says `PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets`. How do you think that could be prevented?
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.296	No, I don't do anything with retweets in the code above.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Maybe I can let that slide ; Will just truncate the rest 
	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.5859	The solution is to test _before_ outputting something, like:   instead of:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ahh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You know what the `break` statement does?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Terminate 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Terminate what? The whole program?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Inside the loop 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Correct! The break terminates the loop in which it is placed
	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.4588	Glad I remember some of my stuff ; Will try this out 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	A class consists of objects etc ; And an instance is an object 
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.9065	I agree that an instance is an object, but not that a class 'consists of' objects.; Mjah not bad. A *class* is indeed a kind of definition which says what data exists and what methods (functions) there are to operate on it. However, having a *Person* class doesn't give you actual persons. You'd have to _instantiate_ some Person objects and give them names, ages, etc...; And in Python, as well as Swift, we can instantiate objects by calling the class as if it were a function. `fred = Person()` will instantiate an instance of the class Person and have `fred` reference it. In Javascript you have to use `new` to create a new instance of a class.; In Ruby too!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ahh
	0.0	0.59	0.41	0.4173	So you like learning Python?
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.7316	I found it more interesting than other languages ; Need to learn so I can be better ; I can analyse data ; Usually use r ; In this case need to use python 
	0.043	0.685	0.272	0.9245	Oh, I never tried 'R'. I was charmed by Python many years ago because of its great data structures and ease of manipulating them. Nowadays I'm also looking into JavaScript (it has become lots better lately) and Clojure and ClojureScript (LISP always fascinated me, so expressive and succinct!).
	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.4215	That's why am using python here ; Easier to just get what I need.
	0.106	0.721	0.172	0.5916	The JavaScript community has even invented *coffeescript* which is a kind of JavaScript but without all the brackets and syntax burden! It uses indentation for blocks of code, just like Python does. Same goes for CSS languages like Less and Sass, and template languages like Jade and Pug.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Need to research it ; As u mentioned earlier, it wasn't really a json file ; Just wanted it to be readable so I can analyse it properly 
	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.7712	I agree that it should be text-only (not binary!) so you can inspect it in an editor; But serialized JSON, everything on one line, is just as useful as XML ;-)
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	I use *pprint.pprint(obj)* to print out objects nicely
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.4023	Here's the thing. I am working on a paper for my dissertation ; My supervisor said that I won't be judged for code ; Just the analysis as it's about  social media ; So that's why I know it's not unethical to ask 
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4019	I helped some PhD's in the past, (for free), maybe I can help you too?
	0.396	0.512	0.092	-0.836	I would appreciate it. Lost a lot of time as my father was ailing from cancer and lost his battle a month ago 
	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.1513	I'm so sorry to hear that. It happened to my grandparents.; <@Vonnie> Another PhD I helped was about <https://github.com/motoom/farasabina>
	0.302	0.698	0.0	-0.0772	Sorry to hear that 
	0.035	0.852	0.113	0.4767	I could help you with the hard programming parts of the data analysis of your dissertation, and the only compensation I ask for is that I can open-source the software on GitHub as a showcase.; Would you be fine with that?
	0.0	0.565	0.435	0.9068	That would be great. I would appreciate it ; Code being open source helps ; Would it be OK after I get my grade?
	0.045	0.712	0.243	0.8679	<@Vonnie> My email is <mailto:motoom@xs4all.nl|motoom@xs4all.nl> - and I'm glad you agree with me that Open Source is great. It's all for the advancement of Science, no? It is so important that peer reviewers can inspect every step in the scientific process.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Indeed ; Learning should be for everyone 
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Open-sourcing your data and methodogies fit in that pattern.
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.6597	Yes will help others 
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.4199	Now, Science and Art... I've also done Art projects (for free!) like <https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords> for which I did all the programming

	0.0	0.435	0.565	0.3804	That's quite cool
	0.173	0.715	0.112	-0.0974	Too bad Luis is not active on the project anymore, but, interests shift and people move to other things.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4215	True 
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.4019	Yes, the Internet (Web?) never forgets things.

	0.394	0.606	0.0	-0.3818	Things last ; Even embarrassing tweets 
	0.0	0.703	0.297	0.886	Yeah that's what makes me laugh ; My main aim was to understand troll like behaviour ; My supervisor said it was too ambitious and I needed to stick with something on a smaller scale 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But how would you detect 'troll behaviour'?
	0.0	0.458	0.542	0.8074	Yeah that's why he said it was too ambitious :)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But do you have an idea what makes a 'twitter troll'?
	0.369	0.631	0.0	-0.8225	So I suggested I crawl four trends ; A person who harasses others and is vile. ; So I crawled them 
	0.0	0.771	0.229	0.5803	I agree, but how do you deduce that from the text of the tweets? You looking for certain troll-words?
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.4588	Yes and that's why I want to do a word cloud ; Here's what I did 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ah, I see.
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.8423	Interesting! You begin with a hypothesis, and do work to prove of disprove it. That's the scientific method, isn't it?; ...and are you also capable of making predictions after analysis of all teh data?; Like, what people are likely to be trolls? What behaviour is indicative of trolls?
	0.0	0.705	0.295	0.4466	That is OK. How do we do that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(Discussion moved to private channel)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Any idea to implement array and their operations without using numpy 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html>? what are you trying to do and why not numpy?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	A template?
	0.0	0.613	0.387	0.802	Thank you <@Marcie>; I will try; lol......It works. Thank you so much <@Marcie>; You save my life
	0.238	0.682	0.079	-0.738	Sorry, I have one more problem, in django, connect to aws, when ‘eb open’, shows Internal server error, 500 error in browser. Does anyone know how to solve it. I google it, but it still can not solve my problem.
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.3182	<@Alvina> that usually means there's some sort of issue with the ELB hitting the health endpoint, make sure your ELB health checks are able to hit your server and check your server logs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hey everyone.; I've a Django interview coming up in about 8 hours.; Any tips on what I should be looking at? I've only a few months experience with it.
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.34	<@Hattie> get as much sleep as possible, maybe play around a bit with some Test Driven Development for django
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.6908	I'm at work, lol; I had a good 5 hours of sleep.; Its 10AM here and the interview is at 6PM
	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.8898	ahh; that's not too bad i guess; if it's a junior position, try and focus on what you've learned in your months with django, try and identify what you're doing well and what you're excited to learn next; ensure you know how testing frameworks interact with django, ensure you know how to write some tests, maybe go over the model and filtering examples again so you're aware of filter chaining and foreign key relationships
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	Got you. Thanks <@Marcie>
	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4939	<@Thomasina> first one; there are always gonna be `lat` and `long` params, and this way it looks pretty
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina>, have to disagee with <@Suellen>. The second would be my preference; especially with a rest api resource, wince `report` is a verb, and defines a resource; `lat` and `long` are attributes for that resource; but I would suggest definining what the requirements for `report` is... eg `location`; `/report/location?lat=&lt;lat&gt;&amp;long=&lt;long&gt;`
	0.815	0.185	0.0	-0.5267	looks awful %)
	0.0	0.719	0.281	0.5459	so this is better? `/report/90.49283/-56.934`?; that doesn't make any sense,
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why?; it's the same thing
	0.216	0.784	0.0	-0.296	looking at it, it has no context at all
	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.3109	and why do you need context while looking at the URL?; `?`, `=` and `&amp;` have almost no place in 2017
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh bull; they absolutely do
	0.084	0.806	0.11	0.1697	As a user, it's more confusing to see `?`, `=` and `&amp;`, then just `/`; why do my URLs have to look like that?
	0.237	0.763	0.0	-0.6801	so, I fail to see how the first makes more sense; location with two numbers in slashes; what are those numbers?
	0.145	0.726	0.129	-0.1027	doesnt apply here exactly; because `/help` is just one resource that takes in one parameter; `/report/number/number` is pretty crappy design
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	no, that's way too technical of an explanation
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	doesn't tell me anything abut what `report` is to take; <http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#advanced-queries>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	once you visit literally one report page you'll know exactly how to use it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then looking through a list of URL endpoints; where `report` can have multiple filters
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	&gt; An API is the user interface for a developer; you kinda forgot about the users here; doing things by the book will only make other developers pat you on the back
	0.198	0.696	0.106	-0.3612	so?; `/reports` is a good identifier; leaving everything else after that in slashes is crappy design; especially when the purpose is to _filter_
	0.32	0.68	0.0	-0.765	so what happens if a person DOES implement it that way?; what's the penalty for crappy design
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	give someone else the project
	0.446	0.554	0.0	-0.6629	developers are angry and users are a tiny bit less confused %)
	0.679	0.321	0.0	-0.7469	but no complaints from users?
	0.0	0.506	0.494	0.4449	users don't give a shit
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I could theoretically recite this URL to my mum over the phone; the one with `?stuff=thing&amp;other=dunno`? not so much
	0.039	0.907	0.054	-0.0783	thing about this, you can do what you want; there's just convention, not hard rules; your method to me, is confusing; as a developer and a user; because all it does is tell me this is a report link; with some numbers; nothing about _what_ those numbers are and do
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.505	you are trying to know what an URL is before visiting it; just open the page and it will be clear as day, you'll never forget those two numbers
	0.128	0.872	0.0	-0.4767	hi I have a doubt what is the difference between json.loads(b’byte_string_from_outside’) and b’byte_string_from_outside’.decode(‘utf-8’) because I read docs and experiment a little bit but is confusing because but seem to work, which one should  go ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The former will return a `dict` representation of the JSON. The latter just returns a `str`.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in the first case may be returned any type that can be represented in json, not only dict; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where can I import `MatchObject` from?; for re
	0.077	0.839	0.084	0.1027	float, with `asdecimal=True`; <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.Float>; &gt;&gt;&gt;Type representing floating point types, such as FLOAT or REAL.  This type returns Python float objects by default, unless the Float.asdecimal flag is set to True, in which case they are coerced to decimal.Decimal objects.; no; you're storing coordinates; so you need something with that ability; specifically, store decimal numbers; <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric>
	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.9046	Not wanting to throw an extra complication into the mix, but if you're doing a lot of geographical work, you might want to be using something like PostGIS and doing spatial queries on the DB; (Also, yes, float isn't quite high-precision enough for most lat/long values that we work with, but only just)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	see also <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	Yep, I'm currently using Postgres
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	+1
	0.0	0.702	0.298	0.7484	<@Gabriele> Thanks for the link! This is so much better than building my own system from scratch.
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.5994	no problem
	0.0	0.725	0.275	0.2263	Always check what already exist ;) 
	0.0	0.68	0.32	0.7906	yeah, good idea; "is there anything already done for this?" is a good question to ask; saves _a lot_ of work
	0.049	0.951	0.0	-0.2944	+1 on using query parameters. in addition to what was mentioned, doing `/lat/lon` also makes it more confusing as it makes it appear to be a parent/child relationship almost. the other form makes for sense for say, a user photo, where you end up with `/user/123456/photos/1241241`
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.3612	<@Thomasina> you should also consider limiting the precision of your lat/lng coordinates to something like `decimal(9, 6)`.  More precision than that often leads to misrepresented accuracy.  6 decimal places is accurate to about 4 inches...
	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.4019	why cant i  get the absolute value of the number i input based on this code?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> you are calling the function from inside it, but after `return`; So, the function has already run
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Input always returns a string I believe 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	both <@Patty> and <@Ciera> are right, note if you are using python2 you need to use the `raw_input` function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	python 3
	0.172	0.828	0.0	-0.3612	Also, you need to have `x()` take an argument that is passed in
	0.0	0.63	0.37	0.5719	Yeah, looks like the indentation is off for that print
	0.0	0.286	0.714	0.3612	like this?
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yep, now convert the `num` to an `int`
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	<@Beula> woah it worked. what do we need to convert it to an int; i did this: num=int(input(‘enter a number: ‘))
	0.0	0.397	0.603	0.7239	woahhh so cool. thanks very much!
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.636	No problem!
	0.225	0.775	0.0	-0.4926	<@Shelly> Fact: I have never eaten, nor even seen, a taco.; I think I'm a freak!
	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.9011	Oh, glad I'm not completely alone then. I must say though I'm awfully curious to try one though. I'm pretty sure there's a place within walking distance of here that sells tacos. I may just have to check them out.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I've seen plenty of tacos in various commercials and whatnot and to be frank they do look appetizing.
	0.0	0.575	0.425	0.5719	<@Thomasina> tacos are a perfect street food.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	especially after an afternoon on the bike
	0.0	0.684	0.316	0.5719	rice, beans and meat are a perfect combo to recover
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	I’m asking your help because I’m in a little rush is for tommorrow my work
	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.4753	Imagining having a taco outdoors after a nice bike ride...ah now I'm hungry!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Coretta> what is slow about it?; and what are you trying to get to in terms of speed?; rabbitmq is already very fast
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4215	I use the same code of the tutorial just change the finnocci funtion for a bot; that i have; I only want liitle tips like what is faster no_ack=True or no_ack=False; how to config the options
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it’s faster without acking, and with prefetching generally
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.1901	I’d recommend to choose no_ack not by speed but by your use case
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also is the function on the bot is running taking that long time? or is that from after the function is completely to sending back to the response? that should only be milliseconds
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the specific ‘i’ i wanna get in that range
	0.086	0.863	0.051	-0.2263	you can return from within the `for` if you want, no reason to keep iterating (otherwise you will *always* get the last `i` value)
	0.161	0.839	0.0	-0.8271	but the problem of my code is not this; i couldnt get output with the code i pasted; oh i got 24 but its the wrong answer.; it should be 6; after i changed the thing i return to this:; then it worked and got 6; <@Shelly>
	0.0	0.972	0.028	0.0772	because in Python variables are scoped for the function in this case. So `i` keeps getting re-assigned as it loops over the `range`; If you want to use the `i` without an intermediate variable, either return the `i` directly (as I demonstrated), or use the `break` statement
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	<@Beula>  what is the code look like when you return the i directly
	0.21	0.79	0.0	-0.3382	Basically drop in my code snippet!; Those should be equivalent
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.2144	i appreciate it but they dont work; i got this:; if x % i == 0 and y % i == 0:                                 ^ TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> Did you mix spaces and tabs?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I assume she copied my snippet
	0.245	0.755	0.0	-0.0772	Oh sorry, just caught that
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.6597	Looks like what you posed used tabs <@Kandis>  - the python standard is to use 4 spaces instead; So my stuff is configured different, if you re-do the indentation to match that visually, you will be good
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea i copied and pasted; oh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you're using ipython, just do `%paste`
	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.3724	i am using pycharm <@Meg>; and me too ive been using tabs and nothing wrong yet
	0.156	0.708	0.136	-0.2056	Oh, shoot! My bad. Although I'm curious why spaces are the standard. I think it seems so much easier to press tab once for every indent than space four times for every indent.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> You're trying to convert <@Beula>'s snippet from spaces to tabs?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina> - you should make your editor insert 4 spaces when the tab key is hit. You don't literally type `&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;...`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1s <@Kandis> - let me convert it
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.5927	tabs vs. spaces. I am a spaces person, but I can see why tabs would be better.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	queue clip from silicon valley!; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI>
	0.0	0.67	0.33	0.8702	I'm definitely going to read through this PEP 8 style guide. It'll take awhile but I think it'd be a good idea. Thanks for the link!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	79 characters might be the only think that should'nt be followed
	0.055	0.865	0.081	0.1759	yes, but this is serious business! S.V. was lampooning these hair-splitty topics in programming. But to me tabs just bork up my whole work flow.
	0.137	0.863	0.0	-0.4019	<@Kandis> can you repost the problem statement? I scrolled up looking for it, and I was unable to fnd it
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	Technically, any int mod 1 is 0; So it's kind of right; You probably want `range(2, ...)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	which edit?
	0.077	0.775	0.148	0.4226	<@Beula> Wow! In that clip, unless they're writing Python the girl is obviously wrong from a totally measurable and scientific point of view that is not at all biased by my extreme preference for tabs.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't see any ` (edited)`!?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Levi>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh nevermind, you just beat me, again
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh is to get the HCF — highest common factor
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	HCF = Highest Common Factor?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what happens in x=y on input?; num1 = num2 ?; n.m. I am looking at 20 windows at the same time here
	0.08	0.859	0.061	-0.128	forgive me if I am wrong, but if you are looking for highest shouldn't you set your loop down the integers, rather than loop up?
	0.126	0.743	0.131	0.0258	Oh, maybe that is what I missed in the original intention - I thought it was the LCF
	0.085	0.799	0.116	0.0258	yes, they ask for HCF, not LCF; this is what I always told my students: read the question carefully - at least half of wrong answers are because the question was not properly parsed
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.296	6 is indeed the highest no?
	0.187	0.545	0.268	0.4767	Sorry <@Kandis> - my bad; Yes, <@Levi> is right - it's best to walk DOWN instead of up this one
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea the standard answer i saw is:; it indeed gets the right answer for num1 and num2's HCF which is 6
	0.052	0.879	0.069	0.2263	I think that this loop will work, but it might be suboptimal for large numbers.; but that is a topic for discussion; because you have no way of softcoding a break point in the if-then clause. Whereas if you start high you can jump out as soon as the clause is fulfilled
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	may i ask how did you determine when to loop up or down
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it just "made sense"
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.0772	If you want it a little more terse, combining what I had earlier and what you have:    But this can be simplified even more going backwards instead of brute forcing it:  
	0.0	0.263	0.737	0.6808	yes, version 2 is better
	0.0	0.94	0.06	0.1531	The _when_ is usually a trade-off of how many operations are required until I meet my condition. So when stepping up, you *have to* evaluate every number in the range for the condition. However if you step down, the *first found* number is the answer
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	simplification means reducing the time complexity. Because those two snippets contain basically identical code structures.
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.0772	So for v1 above: your complexity is `O(n)` (or that for the size of the range, every number must be evaluated)
	0.227	0.773	0.0	-0.6249	it is always `O(n)` in version one, where v. 2 is `O(n)` in the worst case
	0.12	0.758	0.122	0.0258	But for v2 the complexity could be at the best case `O(1)` (for any size of the range, only 1 operation is needed) and at the worst case `O(n)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hehe
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does that make sense <@Kandis> ?
	0.031	0.833	0.135	0.6124	woo well explained <@Beula> may i ask if we can leave out the last “-1” in the second version’s range ( for i in range(smaller + 1, 1, -1):); shouldnt it count down one by one already by default
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.6369	<@Kandis> I think the best way to do these things is to experiment. You get intuition that way.
	0.108	0.781	0.112	0.0516	it's a bit like math: a technical skill rather than a pure talent. That is, until you get to the higher levels. But looping limits, aligning indices, all that painful stuff has to be done a few dozen times before you stop thinking about it.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kandis> You should also checkout Asymptotic Notations and complexity.
	0.0	0.631	0.369	0.6249	great point. This is a fundamental theme in programming

	0.0	0.646	0.354	0.508	help me setting elasticsearch-dsl for n-gram!; done!
	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.784	hi, all! I have dict with oldstring as key and newstring as value. I need replace strings in file according to that dict. What is the best way to do that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What have you tried <@Fleta> ?
	0.0	0.566	0.434	0.5574	<@Beula> Well, I think to do it like this: 
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	Does that work?; you could probably simplify it a little for yourself if you can fit the whole file in memory and then re-write it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I thought there is more simple way...
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.6249	Also, if you use `with open` it handles closing the file for you. For those newer pythonistas, these are called context managers and are awesome
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> cool)
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	Yeah, the simplest:    Though there probably is a "better" way.
	0.078	0.78	0.142	0.3758	<@Beula> oh! that's really simple) thanks a lot, forget that it's possible to replace in the whole text not just in line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It saves a few iterations, but it will load the whole file in - so be aware of how large the file is!
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	Oh, it's just hundreds of lines, it will be ok.
	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.6369	You can make rabbitmq faster by using the HiPe compile. But I doubt that's the problem, as you wont notice a difference there until you hit scale.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so has anyone tried to setup travis with a public python repository that has a private repository as a dependency? From what I can tell I need to have a private travis accnt to even do this =(.
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.2732	well it make sense
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this wouldn’t be an issue except that my org has run out of private repos.; i think if i used a dependency link in my setup.py with the env_var of a user token that has access and format the dependency link url with the token it should be able to pull the dependency down.; a lil hacky.
	0.097	0.691	0.212	0.3265	well if the repo is public people would have access; not sure if that's ok for you
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not with the env var
	0.261	0.541	0.198	0.0772	oh sorry I miss env var; yeah it could work
	0.019	0.808	0.173	0.8871	yea, i’ll have to create a new user and give them read access but it sounds feasible. something for the morning!; ok, i found a good resource. i think this will do the trick. <https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth>; <@Beula> travis isn’t letting me put in an ssh key.; it shows me where i can in the docs but it looks like that’s the spot for a travis pro account.
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.296	Oh yeah I'm thinking of your hack, make it an envvar, echo it to a file and then clone ; Travis is pricey
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	oh ok.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Maybe make a basic auth user and use https ; Then in the before process stripe in the creds 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea i found this too. i think you commented @nerdwaller. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4830856/is-it-possible-to-use-pip-to-install-a-package-from-a-private-github-repository#comment55105837_27901245>

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Okey, I will delete one. Should I delete in Django or here?
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4404	Okey, so in the future I will post my question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> at first. After some time without response I will paste it here. Is it a good habit?
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	Thanks for quick intro.
	0.09	0.809	0.101	0.0933	Hmmm... I have a list of dictionaries that I need to merge but sum one of the keys. Need some direction. My Monday brain is not working efficiently. Something like this 
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.1179	<@Kiersten> - is the merge based on the `id` field (or a grouping of the values)? Also does order matter?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would probably use a dict if the dataset is small enough:  
	0.09	0.784	0.125	0.1145	Yeah it's a little awkward, but at the end I meant to print `cache.values()` 
	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.6249	<@Beula> Right of course... it's been a long day for me too. That works great, when the data gets too large I'll adjust as necessary.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file
	0.0	0.979	0.021	0.0772	since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.; the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.; so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you mean live?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Say I run a long-running subprocess

	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.5267	What does the HTML of the page look like? That `{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}` bit should be expanded out, so you can verify what it's passing in; Oh, wait, the token does come through - I had to scroll down to see your Log line. But it's not in 'args', perhaps, and that's okay
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.5994	Also, if you get a 500 error, normally that would give you a traceback, no? So you could see exactly where it breaks
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.6381	ah, so it is coming though as the variable token, but it's not something i can parse from the url because it's not an actual arg; is there a better way to pass data from page to page? maybe with query params?
	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.5499	Maybe, but I don't see how that's relevant here - if you are getting 'token' correctly, it implies the problem is in your `fetch_data` call and how you pass token in is working

	0.242	0.758	0.0	-0.6256	<@Liliana> I mean, the main problem with your code is that you don't do anything useful with a GET request

	0.058	0.819	0.123	0.7089	if the course is really good and the downside is the fact that it uses python 2 then i would just convert as i go. everything i’ve done so far with scipy, numpy, and pandas has worked in python 3.6. google the errors and tracebacks you get and i bet there are a lot of solutions.; the other option is using penv.; pyenv makes it pretty easy to run multiple python versions.

	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.3818	Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I’ll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?
	0.0	0.754	0.246	0.8583	Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive; Especially resource sharing
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	Thanks. Let me read more on the subject
	0.075	0.907	0.018	-0.6249	Hello guys; I got a problem, I want to connect my self to an external site using python requests.; What I aim to have at the end is a way by which I can connect myself to the site using python requests and when I open my browser, I should see myself already logged in; But the problem is when I connect myself using python requests and I open thee browser I'm not logged in; Here's my code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Being logged in is stored in a cookie. Requests has one set of cookies, your browser has another set of cookies
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.4466	OK I see. And how can I make them communicate then
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and ne'er shall the twain ever meet
	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.3612	You'd need to be able to inject the cookies into whatever the browser uses to manage them, which sounds difficult
	0.116	0.817	0.067	-0.2815	<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35495416/importing-request-session-cookies-to-browser>; I mean, seems possible using selenium; if you wanted to go the other way; <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/browser-cookie3/0.6.0>; so, you have a number of problems

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<http://www.seleniumhq.org/>  * requests stores the cookies in a location.  Is this configurable? * Browser cookie storage location path varies by browser and OS.  How will you handle all that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'll rather try to import requests session cookies to the browser
	0.0	0.404	0.596	0.7096	good luck; what's the use case?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> use case ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what is the purpose behind this?; how do you expect it to be useful?; how do you see someone using this?
	0.0	0.963	0.037	0.0772	<@Meg> I'm trying to implement a Single sign on system on a Wi-Fi and an external website. I want that every person connected on my Wi-Fi to be automatically logged in to that website; I once mentioned it here
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so how is this supposed to work with that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Hyman> I regularly use *mechanize* to access websites where you have to login etc...; and fill out forms in general. *mechanize* emulates a webbrowser.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why not?; if its not, we could probably point you in a direction
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.1406	I'm trying to implement a class that create a 2d array, but I'm running into some issues with `__getitem__`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong>, are you using a dict?
	0.096	0.786	0.118	0.128	No, using a list.; Basically just taking a 2d array of N x M; and I have to sum all the values in the columns
	0.253	0.747	0.0	-0.4707	I'd argue that it's probably not worth trying to go overboard on the overloads
	0.045	0.907	0.048	0.0258	Which is easy enough; My trouble comes in here; Basically saying that `__getitem__` is not defined for list; but I've defined it in my class. And it works if my 2d list isn't an object instance; of my class
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.2617	You're assuming it's saying the wrong thing about your class, but most likely you have given it a list when you think you've given it your class
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How should I initialize the list in my class then
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.5994	No idea, you're showing only tiny snippets of code and we've not seen the actual error or the actual structure yet
	0.153	0.734	0.113	-0.1779	Alright let me do this then one sec; The error comes in line 4 with `self.xl_grid[i][j-1]`
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.2263	okay, so obviously your __getitem__ function is irrelevant as you're not dealing with that type here, only lists
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh wait
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Personally I wouldn't be trying to implement that logic in a single hairy one-liner, either
	0.373	0.361	0.265	-0.2263	Yeah i think that's what's broken
	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	what is the _actual_ error?
	0.138	0.818	0.043	-0.5719	The error I had previously was due to attempting to subscript the list twice; it was giving me a message about the list; But not it's not making a 2d array, but that was my fault; Works now
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how are you working locally?; eg, dev/staging/prod with their own specific env configurations
	0.019	0.981	0.0	-0.0772	I just run my code locally...um...I guess that's it. I have the Heroku toolbelt. When I run the command with the toolbet I'm informed that psql.exe could not be found. After a quick search it seems it's because Postgres needs to be installed.; Sorry if I didn't understand your question correctly; I run my app in its development configuration when running it locally. Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?; I didn't think Heroku had a local option
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it does, but you really should have everything replicated locally that's on heroky; as close to 1:1 as possible
	0.0	0.777	0.223	0.3182	Aha. Still curious about how it handles the DB.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup, switch that out for postgres.
	0.058	0.733	0.209	0.7003	I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well.
	0.0	0.953	0.047	0.296	That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.; If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.4215	That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> what; &gt; That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.; SQLite's Full-text search was blazing fast before Postgres had a reasonable FTS at all.
	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.5423	<@Suellen> I didn't say the functionality was slow or bad, just that there isn't so much of it
	0.0	0.618	0.382	0.7343	true that; but I'd guess the most useful stuff is already there

	0.085	0.661	0.254	0.7273	?; oh wow <@Minerva> i see what you are saying.  it's not failing at the flask level, it's failing at the instagram fetch level because the token is wrong
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	If I'm trying to parse some xml should I be using something like `beautifulsoup`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I've not used beautifulsoup, but if it is just xml there are other xml libraries
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I believe that is the one I liked.; It can parse xml without you having to know anything about the content.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and beautifulsoup only has `soup`...; ah, and `beautiful`..
	0.0	0.813	0.187	0.3182	be sure to use `defusedxml` if you are parsing unknown xml
	0.176	0.699	0.125	-0.4131	Yeah I saw there was some possibility of malicious xml with certain libraries unable to deal with it; Why does xml seem so much more annoying than json... ugh
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	Yeah, I would much prefer json.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`import lxml.etree as etree`; `tree = etree.fromstring(binary_data)`

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Slow and frustrating.; lxml should really be in the standard library.
	0.0	0.677	0.323	0.5106	well, `xml` already is and they share an interface (I think)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	all you have to do is 
	0.0	0.566	0.434	0.5574	Yeah I think that the Etree class is shared
	0.186	0.424	0.39	0.34	Why no `BeautifulSoup`? it supports `lxml` as well
	0.233	0.635	0.132	-0.2247	BeautifulSoup's interface is bizarre; like really strange; And it's an abstraction over lxml either way
	0.196	0.652	0.152	-0.1531	I just installed lxml and I noticed I get an import error as well.  
	0.0	0.568	0.432	0.5859	lxml has cssselect, which is a godsend
	0.108	0.801	0.091	-0.128	I'm not concerned about that, to be clear, I'm not using it in this environment, just wanted to see if <@Myong> was doing something wrong.
	0.051	0.889	0.06	-0.1027	MS Windows  For MS Windows, recent lxml releases feature community donated binary distributions, although you might still want to take a look at the related FAQ entry. If you fail to build lxml on your MS Windows system from the signed and tested sources that we release, consider using the binary builds from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries that Christoph Gohlke generously provides.  <http://lxml.de/installation.html>
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.3612	Yeah, I just tried updating setuptools and pip and it didn't work for me. May want to try those other binaries if you need it.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	#JustWindowsThings
	0.115	0.733	0.152	0.1779	holy... there's legitimately no easy way to just grab every element with a tag inside an xml
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	xpath?
	0.0	0.964	0.036	0.4329	I figured it out had to use `.//{tag}` to grab all subelements of the root; I've got this whole thing figured out now I think. A bit of a larger project than I imagined because I have to make like 4 different requests to get all the information/keys I need to be completely automated so I'm trying to skeleton out a small class to do everything in the end.; How is a date supposed to be formatted through a GET?; should it be a date object?; such as using `datetime.datetime`
	0.056	0.765	0.179	0.636	That's what I suspected when I saw the token in the url didn't match the token in the INFO log. I hope it turns out to be an easy fix for you!
	0.052	0.948	0.0	-0.4215	You really can't with a slackbot <@Katheryn> - otherwise what would happen is you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. You may need a fail-over instead where another machine starts up and starts the bot if the main machine fails (of course you would likely have a period of downtime during that failover)
	0.097	0.824	0.079	-0.128	&gt; you’d have two bots listening and responding to all events. Yeah, that was the problem even I had in mind. Should I explore on message queues?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I guess you could, I haven't checked for any that de-duplicate repeat messages though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have never worked with message queues before. Can we have a configuration where event is consumed only by _one_ consumer at a time? Or, is it replicated to all of them?; But all this sounds too complicated, I think. We only have about 800 users using out bot
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I am not aware of a way to only have one consumer listening at a time, but you could use a distributed lock for who is the "active" listener - but those are somewhat complicated.; consul has a mechanism to do this
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i'd just keep all the state in a database; messaging queues and consul in this would make things overly complicated in what's basically a feed consumption mechanism
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.3182	&gt; `i'd just keep all the state in a database` Could you please elaborate more on this?
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.5267	<@Katheryn> you have two services:   service a: talks to Slack RTM, receives messages and puts them in incoming database, reads outgoing database, sends event to slack   service b: consumes messages from incoming database, does logic to generate response, puts outgoing message onto database
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, basically, we are using database as an alternative to a message queue here?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	alternative isn't quite the right phrase i think
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.6359	But depending on your load, you may get some DB locking issues. With 800 users, you are probably OK; even our chat at its busiest wouldn't cause any trouble (that I can think of)
	0.0	0.671	0.329	0.7496	message queues are really good for service discovery but not as good for reliable storage
	0.0	0.967	0.033	0.3291	If you wanted the distributed systems approach for load:  1. N consumers -&gt; Rabbitmq Excahnge 2. RabbitMQ Exchange to any bound queues   *  One queue subscribed for saving to a DB   * Another for processing  You can do different routing mechanisms so the same work goes to the same worker, but instead just allow dupes and test for dupes on the consumer side; But that's way overly complicated for the current need, it sounds
	0.065	0.815	0.12	0.5964	Yes, I would agree. I am more inclined towards <@Marcie> suggestion. One more question, I am using `crontab` as a kind of “automated restart” setup for my bot’s running service and other scheduled events. Few days ago, there was a problem with `crontab`. Not sure about the cause. Any suggestions on improving this setup? Alternatives to `crontab`?; Can we have notifications setup to know if `cron` didn’t run?
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.2732	Well, I’m using `cron` to poll and monitor for my bot’s running process. So, to poll cron, we need another monitor?
	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	No, systemd would replace that need
	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.5719	basically the OS has a construct to ensure a process is always running at a certain "runlevel"; Look into `systemctl` or `systemd` <@Katheryn>; they should be synonymous
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.3029	not sure how to pass an argument to `db.Float` when constructing a Column with ORM; but you can achieve the same with:; `latitute = db.Column(db.Decimal, nullable=False)`; `db.Decimal` (or `db.Numeric`, which is the same) is basically `db.Float` with `asdecimal=True`
	0.062	0.863	0.075	0.0583	It doesn't matter, although you want to be accessing a separate _database_ on it (i.e. `CREATE DATABASE testing`)
	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.3736	<@Gabriele> A different database on the staging server though? Wouldn't that be redundant or am I missing something?
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.4404	I would say that it is good practice to have local, staging and production environments; with everything as close to 1:1 as possible; and not doing so is a major red flag
	0.248	0.752	0.0	-0.3863	You don't want your testing environment accidentally trashing your live or staging environment.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> So, as in having a separate database locally, on the staging dyno, and on the production dyno? (Already have the latter two)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct; so, you work on a laptop, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I work on my desktop at home, but switch to a laptop when I work remotely sometimes.
	0.072	0.896	0.032	-0.3818	what happens if you want to do a little bit of testing in an area with spotty wifi, eg a coffee shop with a saturated network; if you have a local db, that's one less network resource you need to worry about
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> Docker isn't for Windows?
	0.27	0.73	0.0	-0.5859	you misunderstand me; docker is cross platform, and isolates your codebase from the environment; <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/>
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.8541	<@Meg> Oh, yes, I just didn't understand your last sentence I guess. Thanks for telling me about Docker. For some reason I thought Docker was another PaaS or something. Is it actually meant to compliment other PaaS?; Anyone here familiar with PostGIS?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I've done a bit with it.
	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.6177	<@Gabriele> Cool! Do you know where I might be able to get my hands on some sample geography data to experiment with? I have a database but it's full of shape and geometry data and I want to try querying for all objects within a certain radius of a point which I can't do without geography data.

	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.296	Yeah, I wasn't suggesting he use Google Maps, just saying that my application did

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and regarding your query; what is `geom`
	0.158	0.842	0.0	-0.4576	To get all locations within a radius of somewhere is exactly the right sort of problem for PostGIS
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	yeah; because you're working with spatial data
	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.3182	The only simpler solution is to call someone else's API to perform the same operation on their database
	0.08	0.724	0.196	0.3064	and postgis is highly optimized; you could do a naive solution; but it would be significantly less performant
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`geom` is a column containing geometry data (in this case it's the boundaries of towns in a small section of the US).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DistanceSphere.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It needs points, not just any arbitrary geometry
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.6124	Well I better stick with PostGIS then. While load will be very light at first it could become quite heavy later on.

	0.121	0.759	0.121	-0.25	<@Gabriele> Oh yeah, my bad. I guess what I want to do then (to keep things simple) is to work out the center-point of each shape first.
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.3604	I think there are other functions that are more lenient on which types they accept for distance calculations, but the docs for that one suggest that it doesn't

	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.0772	<https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>; might want to use that instead of raw queries, especially now
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	there isn't a shell for flask, like there is for django?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There is

	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.3818	dear friendssss; why does python tell me:; FileNotFoundError: File b’Macintosh HD/Users/Desktop/Programming/AAPL.csv’ does not exist; <@Shelly>; i copied and pasted the path tho
	0.0	0.636	0.364	0.8402	<@Gabriele> Yes, I increased the number to something huge like 57000000 and had some results - from somewhere very far away from Toronto, or North America for that matter.

	0.295	0.705	0.0	-0.6652	The path looks to be attempting to be absolute but is missing the initial slash
	0.0	0.599	0.401	0.6155	HAHA! i got it; <@Winnifred> you are right
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won't run on import)
	0.038	0.915	0.048	0.1119	<@Gabriele> So I took a very large dataset of world cities in .csv and imported them into my database, then I added a `geog` column and used `UPDATE cities SET geog = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326);` which ran without errors. Did I perhaps miss something in that command?

	0.096	0.688	0.216	0.3481	Although it looks like you're assigning geometry to a geography column... not sure if that's okay or not
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.4019	There aren't all that many times when I have enough knowledge to help around here, so I try to do it when I can.; Maybe I should have ran `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)::geography`?

	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.0772	you probably just want a geometry column
	0.082	0.709	0.209	0.7343	Ok so I found the StackOverflow post. I see that it was recommended to run `ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(long, lat), 4326)::geography`. I omitted casting completely.; After reading it doesn't sound like geometry would be a good fit as my use case involves locations on a global scale; Unless I misunderstand the pros/cons which is certainly possible
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Usually it'll depend on what sort of distances are involved
	0.033	0.967	0.0	-0.0572	So for example, I have this script:    I can either call it directly: `python cat.py` and it will meow.  But say I have another module that wants to use this class:    I wouldn't want it to meow until I tell it to 
	0.203	0.797	0.0	-0.6239	That class inherited the meow method, so make an instance and call say on it!  Sorry, a class may have been a bad example
	0.02	0.894	0.086	0.5936	<@Kandis> Oh, niiiice! That's really cool. Yes, I'm not sure whether R would be all that helpful if you learn Python, although learning at least basic SQL could come in handy sometimes. I suppose you'll be doing a lot of data science in your field?

	0.062	0.938	0.0	-0.2732	see. i found something online, here:; Banks use Python for pricing, risk management and trade management platforms. More recently, they’ve been reprogramming their trading systems to run off Python rather than other, clunkier languages.
	0.04	0.81	0.15	0.6201	<@Beula> Oh that's right! Then did you work with pandas, numpy, scikit or similar tech?; I'm not sure how long ML has played a big role in finances but would be interested in knowing.
	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.659	<@Beula> so cool. was python helpful to you during work?
	0.032	0.906	0.061	0.1134	No, I was more in the retail side (to clients directly, vs in a bank) and at the time I didn't know how much was out there!; Yeah <@Kandis> , I wasn't doing a ton of high intensity stuff with it - but I was able to remove about 10-12hours of work/week by automating silly tasks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so cooooooool; were you in a retail bank you said?; what kind of bank; <@Beula>
	0.145	0.855	0.0	-0.296	No, the retail side (not a bank). I was a financial advisor; and stock trader for clients
	0.0	0.747	0.253	0.8885	<@Kandis> I believe there's a ton of opportunity in this space, and it also allows you to branch in different directions should the economy change. Not only a lot of jobs but a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities as well. It's a smart choice.

	0.0	0.975	0.025	0.1154	I sometimes use this for simple unittests. The module is meant to be imported, but I have a few things I want to test that can be tested individually, so throw it under an if name main at the bottom and test away.  I wouldn't suggest this for a larger project though, but for something simple or just to test in development it works.
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	can you suggest some good resources ?
	0.0	0.635	0.365	0.7096	and can you share some advanced resources you use ?; May be something may help
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.8176	You can go through the python tutorial, otherwise I just look at stuff as they come up. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>  Later when you know Python better, Effective Python is a good book - but again, after you know the language and can appreciate the tips

	0.118	0.882	0.0	-0.5984	so, java had a really crappy time/calendar library in the standard library for years before it pulled in `joda-time` into the core API; now, if only python could do something similar...
	0.085	0.82	0.094	0.1565	I think the success of pypi has meant that standard library development has stagnated somewhat, which is a shame; we have a poor selection of date/time libraries, and nothing much of use for multimedia generally. But hey, we have `dbm` for "databases", `nntplib` for all the newsgroups we need to access regularly, and `sunau` for reading ancient audio files, so it's not all bad
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just a little

	0.0	0.68	0.32	0.872	sqlite is great; But I do think Python would be better if there was more effort spent on getting good packages into the standard library
	0.12	0.655	0.225	0.408	yeah.. maybe.. but it's not that easy; say you want a better datetime. what do you pick?; Arrow? Why not Delorean?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's not the sort of thing you need to answer immediately in a chat... you'd get a few knowledgeable people, they'd discuss it for a bit, find use cases, check code quality, etc
	0.175	0.612	0.212	0.2278	There's going to be a huge debase, because it's not like it's clear which of the two is massively better.
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.0191	Doesn't matter. This happens already for other PEPs. There's a discussion, then a decision is made
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But PyPI provides an illusion of a democracy, where you can chose whatever you want.; Python and PEPs isn't a democracy at all; so maybe it's a calculated decision -- to not introduce some things into stdlib
	0.074	0.798	0.129	0.5574	PyPI wouldn't go away. Users are always free to reinvent the wheel; And yeah, it probably is a calculated decision; one I disagree with; If you're gonna say that batteries are included, they should be good batteries, ones suitable for powering modern software; Maybe it's not relevant to anything else in the program; Generally speaking I avoid it if possible
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	it you're trying to limit the number of imports, I can understand
	0.142	0.858	0.0	-0.5859	Reasons for importing something inside of a function?. Besides avoiding circular imports; I have just done it for avoiding circular imports on some celery tasks. But i have seem it on open source projects
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	especially highly specific imports
	0.524	0.476	0.0	-0.5106	It also violates PEP8
	0.258	0.742	0.0	-0.8402	but isn't there a bit of a penalty in doing so?; performance penalty, that is; because that method gets hit; has to import a dependency before continuing execution
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I read that imports are expensives
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they can be
	0.059	0.941	0.0	-0.0516	and some people leave the more expensive ones in functions that arent often called, thats a main reason i see it too
	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.4767	hellooo friends; anybody knows what this means; i saw this code in here:

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but t is an array?
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.3182	the function applies to every element of the original array; so you see three plots: `y = x^1`, `y = x^2` and `y = x^3`
	0.126	0.631	0.243	0.6908	I know you can use a `with` block in some other test packages, but to be honest this seems like a weird thing to be testing for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have here a very small unit test program which is supposed to test  that an object throws an AttributeError exception when a nonexistent attribute lookup is attempted.  
	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.1513	You could probably use `self.assertIn("donation", item.__dict__)` or some similar abomination if you really want a one-liner
	0.03	0.866	0.104	0.5187	<@Gabriele> Yeah it sounds weird, but actually the object under test is some kind of container giving both attribute and keyed lookup access to a set of properties, and I need to test whether the right exceptions are thrown during lookup of a nonexistent property.
	0.13	0.778	0.093	-0.25	Sounds like a bad idea to me. But if I had to write tests for it, I'd just use the __dict__ check directly. Or `hasattr`.
	0.121	0.656	0.223	0.4501	<@Gabriele> Bad idea? You have a better idea? Thanks for the `hasattr` tip! This is what it's all about, the `Bunch` object: <https://github.com/motoom/bunch>
	0.05	0.95	0.0	-0.2247	I think that is unnecessarily blurring the lines between a container and a type. If you don't know what attributes a type has, then you don't really know what interface it provides, which makes it a very awkward object to work with
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.3612	<@Gabriele> I use it declutter my source code. Basically it is a `dict` like object where you don't have to type `["` and `"]` all the time. So I can write:for r in bunched(recordset): # Where recordset is fetch_all() of DictCursor    if r.salary &lt; 3000:       print r.name, "could use a raise" ```; Psycopg2 has a `NamedTupleCursor`, which provides the same syntax.
	0.14	0.86	0.0	-0.2755	In that case, at least the schema is documented elsewhere. But I don't like it.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The alternative would be:  You prefer that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Maybe
	0.083	0.729	0.188	0.4885	In the general case, yes. It's not exactly a great hardship. In a database context, it might be nice to have a type that directly reflects the DB schema - which is what we have ORM for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	btw, the `NamedTupleCursor` gets its attribute names from the fields behind the *SELECT*. I.e. `select name, salary from Employees` would result in *.name* and *.salary* attributes on the tuples in the resultset.
	0.292	0.636	0.072	-0.7645	I just really dislike things that attempt to cut down on a bit of typing by ruining the interface. Several parsers do it, like BeautifulSoup. lxml.objectify is even worse
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.1877	I wouldn't call it ruining. It makes the code more readable to me. I prefer dot notation over index lookup with a string.
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.34	The dot notation and the index lookup carry different information. `x.y` implies that `y` _must_ exist. `x["y"]` implies that a value for "y" might exist, if someone added it earlier.
	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.34	Ah, we have a different view on that too. When I see `x["y"]` in code, I assume the programmer knows that an *y* value is present, or should be present (punishable by KeyError). When I see `x.get(y)`, then I know the programmer is trying to communicate to me that *y* perhaps does not exist in *x*.
	0.0	0.977	0.023	0.0387	it's an object that contains an arbitrary number of other objects; <@Ruben>  But the point is that you see it's a dict, and that the contents vary; Obviously you can make assumptions if you know what's been added, but the syntax tells you the nature of the structure you're working with

	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.5664	Ok...but I'm not sure if I should be using geography or geometry...If I wanted to show points over the size of, say, the continental US, would that be a problem with geometry?
	0.015	0.918	0.067	0.6638	Are you showing points over that sort of area within a single query? And what are your accuracy requirements?; PostGIS is definitely awkward to work with, I'll give you that. And understanding the geom/geog stuff, and converting between them, is fiddly. But stick at it.; I have a geography column in my DB (specifically, `geography(Point,4326) NOT NULL`), and it works for me. I only need to find places near other places, and each place is represented with a point, so I don't have rigorous requirements on accuracy, or the need for it to be correct over long distances; So I could probably have been okay with a geometry object
	0.07	0.881	0.049	-0.3892	Geography has fewer functions available on it, so you need to convert to geometry to perform various tasks; I mostly just compare distances, so geography is fine. The geography type basically exists to allow for accurate distance comparisons; But trying to perform complex perimeter or area calculations on the surface of a not-quite-sphere is complex, so for that sort of thing, I think that is where they require you to project to geometry and suck up some error

	0.0	0.91	0.09	0.5859	Ok. So my question is:   I have the following folder structure:   C:\      -0.82\  I have this line of code:   `app.connect(path=r"C:\0.82\file.exe")`  Then, the C:\ folder gets updated and I have this:    C:\      -0.82\     -0.86\  Now I want to use regex to connect to the folder 0.86\  `app.connect(path=r"C:\0.\d\d\file.exe")`  But that wasn't right and I don't understand regex.  Can someone please describe how to use regex correctly in this scenario?
	0.042	0.908	0.05	0.1169	Is the file update deterministic? If so - you may not want regex; My guess is one of your issues will be the backslashes from the windows path, which are "escape sequences" in regex, so `C:\0.\d`, `\0.` probably isn't what you want, `\0` is escaping "0" and then `.` is any char, I think a starting point may be: `C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	@hi; Can any one suggest the document for managing pcap files for replaying SNMP traps?
	0.073	0.927	0.0	-0.357	The file update is somewhat incremental; I'm not sure what's going on. There is an 'r' prefixed in the string so its a raw string and \\ is not needed to escape the file path \ in this case. Can you update your answer with this in mind?
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.6808	It actually does need the escapes in the regex string, it gets compiled and `\d` is a "digit", and `\0` isn't anything, so your regex needs to escape; If you read the docs for the `re` package - you'll see the same behavior I describe, all the raw strings still escape the special chars
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jame> what google says: <http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/>
	0.014	0.888	0.098	0.8979	<@Christa> Here is a snippet from the official docs:  &gt; Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal. &gt;  &gt; *The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r"\n" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while "\n" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.
	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.3804	I'm sort of confused.  Do I have to prefix the string with a function    re(`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`); re(`"C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe"`); or re(r`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`)

	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.6705	If it's always an incrementing number, the easy solution is list the directory (`os.listdir`), convert them into floats, and take the highest

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina> the first example sets an SRID of 4386 (WGS84).  the second example doesn't set an SRID and should get the default for geometry which is 0

	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.6124	Depends what your doing.  When SRID is 0, the data gets treated like it's on a Cartesian plane (flat).  Using 4326 allows for a round earth.  If you're trying to do things like get the distance between two points, it can make a difference.

	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	Looks like it uses registry settings, and doesn't examine actual files, just filenames
	0.09	0.845	0.064	-0.2263	Yeah, with an existing file the result is the same.; Looks indeed as registry settings. I thought that `mimetypes` was supposed to be os-independent... I guess I am wrong? I just assumed it that way.
	0.194	0.806	0.0	-0.34	What type a file 'is' can always be open to interpretation, unfortunately
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Thomasina> with alot of these postgis questions yo have, there should be answers on <https://gis.stackexchange.com/>
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.4696	oh, interesting; are you using 9.6 postgres?; and the latest postgis?; I've never encountered your issue
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.3612	so, if you use something like pgadmin; and open up the tree down to your new database; so postgis is in your db extensions?; also, what is your query you're running; usually when you get this issue with postgis, it means you're inputing invalid types in the function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	postgres might need a restart when you install postgis
	0.073	0.927	0.0	-0.2057	especially on windows; because you can't update certain files when the system is running; so you ether need to restart the service or reboot
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	Yep - on Windows open up Task Manager, pick Services, find postgres whatever, right click, Restart
	0.029	0.892	0.079	0.3919	Hello guys I'm trying to implement a proxy server in the form of a python script it presents itself like this; I want to operate 4 basic steps; 1- Listen from the web browser; 2- Forward the request to the web server; 3- Get the response from the web server; 4- Send back the server response to the browser; My main problem is first at step 2. This is because at a certain point, i want to rewrite the URL from the browser and I don't know how to do that and I'm just a beginner
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There are existing proxies that can rewrite URLs. You don't need to write any software to do it.
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3182	Oh... I didn't knew that. Can you please give me an example of one ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and if you're using nginx; <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html>
	0.0	0.407	0.593	0.7034	OK i'll try it thanks guys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> Apache in 2017?
	0.213	0.651	0.136	-0.3182	Sure, go old school ; Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM; ... etc
	0.0	0.546	0.454	0.1695	don't forget mod_perl
	0.107	0.802	0.091	-0.3716	I would start by moving it all into one function, which gets called once. Then I'd move parts of it into various individual functions based on grouping lumps of shared functionality together. For example, each block of logic in a for loop is a candidate for a function because it's related code that gets called on a succession of data; nah, straight to CGI, none of this crazy new tech; I'd also consider ditching things like `range(len(target_column_G))` which is usually the wrong way to iterate over something in Python
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	<@Gabriele> Thank you, I read about functions except I never really implemented one, any dummy proof example on this snippet how can I have them in a function?
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4019	I think it's perhaps too fundamental a concept to explain in chat. Maybe a tutorial will help, e.g. <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm>
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.6369	Thank you, reading it; What would you suggest, to continue working on getting new features and bigger code, or to prioritize implementing functions to clean it up?
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.8225	I'd priotize learning good design and structure; because once you are able to structure a program effectively, adding new features and maintaining older code is much easier
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	Thank you; <@Meg> Do you have any other notes other tha what <@Gabriele>  mentioned?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	he covered everything, I think; and i'd use some blank lines for separation; for bits that really don't belong in a different function; group variables together by general area of responsibility
	0.046	0.908	0.046	0.0	The problem with learning the right way to write programs is that a lot of it doesn't make much sense until you've gone through the process a few times; I'd say just start small, clean things up, write functions, then maybe write classes, and read through the Python tutorial to understand all the tools available to you
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4939	So <@Gabriele> I should continue developing this and learning other simple functions then when confident enough I release another version with functions?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't know - what is your end goal here?
	0.038	0.962	0.0	-0.5499	Having an issue with instantiation of a new object within another one as an attribute. I have two classes as such `class a` and `class b`; in class a under `__init__` I do `self.obj = b()`; and I attempt to run a function from `class b` via the `obj` variable through `self.obj.run_func()` within `class a`; I think a line got deleted that I typed, can't quite tell...; But either way, `class b` isn't really a child as much as it's just an attribute of the `class a` but attempting to run a function within `class a` on the `obj` variable gives a reference error
	0.474	0.526	0.0	-0.4019	show the actual error

	0.119	0.881	0.0	-0.3182	classes aren't objects, so these details are critical; In your definition of `class b`, is there a method `run_func`?

	0.388	0.612	0.0	-0.2263	<@Suellen> You'll confuse things...
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.2406	yeah, but I don't understand exactly where it's coming from?; Is it the import into the other module?
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.5927	<@Gabriele> I am writing a software which is used by few customers now, it does the job now, but I am looking to both better myself and my code that's all, so seeking advice if in your opinion I should let it stay the same for now till I learn more or continue working on adding more then later enhance.
	0.175	0.73	0.095	-0.2732	errors typically tell you exactly where they come from, with a line number
	0.333	0.667	0.0	-0.5423	Ah shiet; Got it, bad indent into init
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.4215	<@Gertude> For your personal development you should read more about the language and practice with it, improving your code as you go

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But I see it doesn't have intros and it's spot on to functions
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	correct; it gives you an item of specific consideration; and does a good evaluation throughout
	0.168	0.778	0.054	-0.5892	There's not really any good way to get good at programming without starting at the beginning and making sure you understand the fundamental building blocks: control flow statements, functions, variables and objects, types, structures and classes, etc

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I think back to the code I should implement a `re.finder` Function and pass the patterns later on
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4215	No... you wouldn't be adding a `finder` function to `re`; But you could write a function that does contain all the 'finding', if you liked
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ah huh; One function that has all the finding with all the patterns; And when writing I call the right one?
	0.171	0.829	0.0	-0.4767	I don't know what you mean by that. The alternative would be to call the wrong one...
	0.085	0.799	0.115	-0.0121	The function would have the `re.findall` with all the patterns, and when writing to the csv I call one from what I define at the top; Best to shut up and go read, thank you both; <@Meg> Thank you, I get bored from intros though, because as you saw I can write some code that works but not happy with the quality.
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	Good for getting date input?
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	It looks like it would work
	0.0	0.681	0.319	0.7269	Is `ConfigParser` a pretty good tool for setting up constants; About to get started with it
	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.4497	You don't really need it if you're not distributing or deploying your software, but for managing configuration constants, sure, it works
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.85	I've just got a global constant `.py` file with values, but I also need to be able to set global constants based on user input. They're being set in a class so I suppose I could always just pass the class object around and grab values that way, but I'm sort of looking for something a bit nicer
	0.256	0.744	0.0	-0.4767	if it's user input then configparser is the wrong tool
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.34	generally what I do these days is a combination of environment variables and Click for the CLI; loading from a .env file as well if people want to have stuff in there
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	i like having a .env.example file
	0.0	0.606	0.394	0.6369	^ Always helps clear up so many questions for most people
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.3612	and if it’s something like a flask app, I’ll usually tie it all together in a `config.py`
	0.061	0.873	0.066	0.0516	Hey guys,  using `sqlalchemy` I have field `created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)` and I confused, How I can get data by datetime. For example, I need get data for current day. and I did something like this.    But the example didn’t work(
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you getting None or something?
	0.474	0.526	0.0	-0.2023	just empty array
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Right now you are filtering based on this exact moment; so that understandably won't work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but in the database I have record with current day.
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.2144	day, yes; but not the current minute, second, hour of the request
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`datetime.now()` against a timefield will be date/time; `date.now()` may work; I think you may need a between query for start/end of the day
	0.0	0.763	0.237	0.8126	You think it's best to create a `.env` file for the user and give an example or create one if one does not exist in the directory and write to it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The standard is `.*rc` files, so I usually use `~/.foorc`; At least on linux
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.2144	<@Beula> Yes, I need implement `between` too, but first need to implmenet for current day, 2 minutes, I’ll try
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2732	Well between start of day and end of day is "current date" - which is what I am getting at
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Johana> was it you that had the `example.env` file?
	0.039	0.713	0.247	0.8573	env.example ya; or `.env.example` my bad.; no but i can create one.; `.env.example` ; then you can run `cp .env.example .env`; and fill out the values; then run `source .env` and be good to go.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is that in your gists?
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.0772	I think you either want `&lt; get_today() + 1day` or to do `&lt;= get_today()`
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.197	0.803	0.0	-0.4019	Is there any way to run pycharm in debug with commandline arguments?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.048	0.793	0.159	0.4939	Yeah, you can use the same run menu with command line args and click the debug icon instead of play - or are you seeing something funky?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	go to run configuration
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is it under the script parameters
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yep; those are the args passed to it
	0.061	0.809	0.13	0.713	Got it; I'm using a module called `simple_settings` and after a few times of accessing the configured settings I get; lol; But the stack trace pretty much shows all calls to the `simple_settings` module and I really don't understand why. I think I may just not use that at all to be honest. But wasn't sure if it was a mistake I made; It seems to be going between these two
	0.0	0.599	0.401	0.6908	well the stacktraces is pretty explicit; python as a recursion limit that you reached
	0.073	0.857	0.07	-0.0258	Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't actually setup the module properly; But it's odd that it goes between the two over and over I'm trying to get to it in debug
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2732	well in fact the `__getattr__` func call `setup` and `setup` call `__getattr__` so it's endless
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cant even debug to where it breaks
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2732	well it breaks as soon as the class is init or called; as `__getattr__` is used quite a lot
	0.045	0.857	0.097	0.3045	Yeah, looking at some stuff now it basically says if `__getattrb__` can access a variable which does not yet exist it will go into infinite recursion; alright got rid of the module, not sure what was happening, figured out a different way
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Has anyone tried to get an event into the Python Weekly newsletter?; Can’t find a point of contact

	0.286	0.714	0.0	-0.4215	Maybe just mock out the arg parse calls?
	0.234	0.638	0.128	-0.25	so you mean we should avoid pip freeze?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I mean what I say)
	0.093	0.771	0.136	0.1779	what kind of project are we talking about here?  if it’s a library, you’ll want to avoid being so specific.  if it’s the end product, you’ll definitely want to be freezing your dependencies to exact versions
	0.102	0.799	0.1	-0.0258	I think it’s problematic for a library to specifically require a version of its dependencies, since unlike say npm Python dependencies are global; I’m pretty sure if I have two dependencies, A and B, which both depend on C, and they specify different versions of C, there is going to be a problem, right?
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	yeah don't do that
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.5859	Also, there are some cool services like PyUp which can scan your dependencies and open a pull request automatically when there are updates

	0.0	0.705	0.295	0.5574	Is there another way to create args dynamically for a function?. I'm currently doing: 
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.2732	well there’s `*args`, which is based on the order (as opposed to `**kwargs`, using keywords as you did); what is it about `*args, **kwargs` that’s not working for you?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i think kwargs is the way to go, same as you're doing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Actually the args needs to have keywords <@Junita>

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	It works for me. I was just thinking that there might be a better way to do it.
	0.193	0.643	0.164	-0.1027	cool, just pointing out there’s also *args which handles positional arguments
	0.095	0.859	0.046	-0.3818	i think that's what i'm going to have to do. i get this gut feeling that i'm doing testing wrong. my tests always are more code and logic than the actual fucntions
	0.07	0.782	0.148	0.6808	Getting an odd error in a dictionary'; I basically have a dictionary with 4 main keys, and their values lead to other keys where in turn their values are integers; However when attempting to do something like `{'key': self.val1 + self.val2}` where `val1` and `val2` are both integers, I get TypeError that they must be str, not int.; So can I not perform addition when setting values in a dictionary?
	0.191	0.809	0.0	-0.765	Most likely you're just wrong about what val1 and val2 are. Probably they are different types; Which is one reason why using a dict instead of something typesafe is a bad idea
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what if you do   `{'key': int(val1) + int(val2)}`?
	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.296	yeah I'll try that real quick; Hmm I guess I'm attempting to index a string with a dict key, so something is going on in the for loop to go through the dict. let me check

	0.182	0.818	0.0	-0.569	no; Consider what happens if you call `isPrime(8)`; (Also, stylistically, you don't need the parentheses around the if statements - it's not Java[Script] :)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> Dict keys are strings? Are other data types converted to strings when used as the key then? I've used several non-string objects as keys.
	0.072	0.769	0.159	0.6059	well, technically keys are hashes; string hash, I believe; but I was wrong; to be used as a dictionary key,   &gt;To be used as a dictionary key, an object must support the hash function (e.g. through __hash__), equality comparison (e.g. through __eq__ or __cmp__), and must satisfy the correctness condition above.; <https://wiki.python.org/moin/DictionaryKeys>
	0.0	0.853	0.147	0.6124	In other words, you can't use mutable things as dictionary keys.; Strings like "Helo" and tuples like (1,2,3) are immutable. But a list is mutable, so you can't use a list as a key.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I usually use `yaml` for configuration
	0.0	0.452	0.548	0.8176	i’ve used it before. it’s pretty nice. i also like yaml.
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.8481	I'm just trying to figure out if it's best practice to grab data for each variable with the configparser module individually like when needed, or setup something like `glob.py` and set them all at once in there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	configparser is ini files so if your used to microsoft world its less parity.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so I can essentially just load in the yaml, store it in a settings variable and import the settings variable everywhere
	0.0	0.751	0.249	0.5647	exactly. You might want to perform some check on it or put some default value but yeah that's the idea

	0.135	0.714	0.151	0.0129	Yeah; oh wait that's the wrong part; one sec; I was previously destroying root every time, but I'd like to just destroy the frame so it doesnt close out 4 times and open back up...; and the settings one is a list; well it's a dict of lists; `settings['route']` is a list though as well as `settings['base_url']`; I tried using `*args`
	0.074	0.699	0.227	0.5423	I think your super calls are a bit weird, you probably want `super(Values, self).__init__(parent, choices)` or if your're on py3: `super().__init__(*args)`

	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.5994	I think it's how you're passing to the super though; I think the signature is `Frame(master, ...options)` - so you may need to unpack your dict as options; `super().__init__(parent, **options)`

	0.198	0.802	0.0	-0.69	<@Chanel> yup! by default `arg_parse()` just looks for the command line arguments from `sys.argv` but you can pass your own list of arguments to it

	0.064	0.914	0.022	-0.6292	Hey guys, working in tkinter and having an issue with the Frames I am instantiating are going in the wrong order. Maybe it's something stupid, but I'm not too sure.; I need to attach a command to a button in tkinter, and it has to be able to attach to another widget/Frame which does not yet exist. So without using `lambda` I get an error because the key does not exist within the dictionary; But I also need to run more than one single expression; How can I reference something that does not exist?; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Look at `functools.partial`
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	Well here's what happens; So I have a main root for my application
	0.059	0.941	0.0	-0.1901	&gt; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and I have 3 classes, one for each different "page" which are all `Tk.Frame` objects
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`lambda: func(button1.text, button2.text)`?
	0.025	0.89	0.085	0.5407	Now in order to show the next frame after a submit button I have to have the next Frame available and already initialized. However in order to initialize the Frame which I want to show I have to also create that function that runs on click which requires the next Frame to also be initializied, but it hasn't been initialized yet because the first one is still being initializied lol; Slightly confusing I will show code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wait, lambdas "execute" when you access them; i.e. `lambda: func(x)` - `func` won't be called until you click the button
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There is basically a `dict` with `Frame: Frame obj`; When it hit's the Repos Frame, it gets to this function; `self.submit = Button(self, text="Submit", command=submit(self, controller))`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Neither will a function though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	which breaks at the last line; With a key_error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`Button(self, text="Submit", command=submit(self, controller))`; here you're not saying "call `submit` when clicked"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let me try `lambda: func()`
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.5859	you call `submit` and return a value, and assign this value to `command`; wut; here's a piece of code from a project of mine which uses Tk: ; the same principle
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It works
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.6908	also `lambda: func()` works. Should have just done that....; <@Suellen> since it seems you've used tkinter, what's the best way to go about passing data to another Frame. I'm trying to grab a selection and place it inside a label to show a user what they selected, but in the same way as before it places the default value into the label instead of grabbing the updated one.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If `lambda: func()` works just `func` should also work...
	0.065	0.935	0.0	-0.0276	That was my experience with most desktop ui programming, it's a little funky what you have to do
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I just need 4 screens; that's it
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.7003	there's a good side though: you better understand what happens under the wraps in other GUI frameworks
	0.268	0.536	0.195	-0.4404	god is this bad; Should have just made a frontend, honestly; just attempting to format this is so bad.
	0.097	0.873	0.029	-0.5187	That's a bit rude, but I challenge you to show me how this case above is not the same, vs just saying it's not. Here is proof it is:    You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case); 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	&gt; nooo waaay
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I legitimately just have two frames of a 2 labels, a dropdown and a button
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is what I was referring to
	0.0	0.576	0.424	0.7096	and I can't get them to do anything lol; Format wise
	0.104	0.896	0.0	-0.296	&gt; You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is actually what I should have showed  
	0.0	0.684	0.316	0.2144	Yes, you're right 100%; but
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	effectively foo and bar are the same here
	0.053	0.797	0.15	0.4449	tkinter callbacks don't accept arguments, they are all callables compatible with `lambda: x`; but you almost always need to pass something that takes a whole lot of arguments
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	This talk wasn't directly about tkinter
	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.1779	therefore it's a common pattern to hide the stuff that you actually need to do behind a simple unassuming lambda
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that was the general context, but not to my comment about `lambda: foo()` and `foo` being the same
	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.5859	alright I got it. Now I need a progress bar.

	0.351	0.649	0.0	-0.4019	I’m noticing an immediate syntax error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you even use comments in a dict?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	shouldn’t it be `replication:`
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	oooooh yes
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	yeah, in your second dict in the list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	should be `'replication': { ...}`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^^
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you have it in two locations; both `replication` keys

	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.6249	sometimes its the little things; and things like this is where using an editor or IDE helps; because it can check your code for syntax validity as you write it; not so much with the shell or ipython
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	so flake8 said that was valid python?; interesting
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	yeah idunno what it thought i was looking for
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	you may want to write a bug report about that on their gitlab; include that dict structure as an example
	0.0	0.676	0.324	0.8245	that’s not a bad idea; worst case there really is some half valid reason for syntax like that and they close it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup; don't see anything on the tracker about dictionaries that applies; so, maybe an edge case?

	0.171	0.829	0.0	-0.4767	Mine have been for as long as I can recall - but maybe it accidentally overrode your config
	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.1901	It looks like many of the colors changed a bit. I don't remember what color functions were, maybe they were highlighted, but it is different. The TODO: colors also look a little different.
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	<@Meghan> yeah my colors got changed too
	0.0	0.538	0.462	0.8225	<@Ciera> Are they easy to change back? I think I liked the old ones better.
	0.0	0.752	0.248	0.6808	Yeah color are easy to edit. But you need to figure out what they where before. I launched the previous version and compared some
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Mine were changed with 2017.2
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	I tried the IntelliJ theme, I can't stand it, it's too bright and the colors don't stand out much.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I use darcula with small modification 
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.3612	Yeah, that's what I use. Only issue I have with the prior to this week colors is that I want multi-line TODOs.; That's more of how it parses those than the color though.
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	multiline todos would be nice - have you had that working before?
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	I haven't.; Just something I would like to see.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Aww, I thought you were about to make my week!
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.0772	quick question assume I have a list `["abc","ab","cda" ..]` I want to remove all elements that are substring i.e. in this case it would be `["abc","cda"]`; what is the quickest way to do that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	len?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	huh?
	0.0	0.639	0.361	0.7845	<@Thelma> what have you tried?; We like to see what you've tried before just giving answers :)
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

	0.17	0.742	0.088	-0.2999	You want a substring, right? So I'm not sure a `!=` makes sense ; Try `in`
	0.0	0.84	0.16	0.2732	I have that as well; just ensures it doesn’t check the same element
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jed>  here, actually
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Also any returns a Boolean, aren't you trying to remove from the list?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	from zipfile import ZipFile doesn’t work actually. I’m using Python 2.7
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Or filter it down, rather 
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4215	So is it working, or are you trying to make it faster/more efficient?
	0.0	0.492	0.508	0.4754	make it more efficient
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	basically there are 3-5 files in each zipped folder: file_a, file_b, file_c, file_d  I wanted to make it so that the filename would increment, file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2
	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.296	ah makes sense didn’t notice it; getting a KeyError: “There is no item named “cat_0.csv” in the archive”
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.296	yeah. So basically what you are trying to do is change the name of the file inside the zip and then unzip, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`if f.filename in os.listdir(dir_name)` Maybe?
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4926	Thanks! This is what I have so far, not working as I thought it would be, instead of file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2. It gives file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_3, file_b_4
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.3818	just to be clear, this happens automatically when you `for i, f in enumerate(pet_list):`; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeap!
	0.03	0.922	0.048	0.2168	Check this out: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982034/how-can-i-extract-files-using-custom-names-with-zipfile-module-from-python>; looks like unziping to a tmp folder might be the way to go.; &gt; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD. What I said here, is wrong. Zip file is one that is getting overwritten. NOT the files inside the zip.; so if there are existing files of `file_a`, it should create `file_a_0` and then `file_a_1`, and so on? It just keeps adding to file_a_watever-count and file_b_whatever-count, depending on the files that have already been extracted?
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.2716	anytime i open a file in pycharm it says loading … arggg. why does this happen when i have something really important to fix.

	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.4019	<@Graciela>: at a flance the only difference is that `db` and `c` are both scoped outside the context of the function so they could have different values each time it's called
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that looks legitimate, what behaviours are you seeing?
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.2732	is the logic that creates the cursor `c` called each time the script runs?

	0.092	0.805	0.103	0.0772	hi all, I am new (new to this slack and new to python) and have a question that is driving me crazy. could someone help?
	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.7177	Welcome <@Wendolyn> ! Go ahead and ask, someone will be along to help as they're available (no need to ask to ask)
	0.181	0.787	0.031	-0.9755	the short story is that I'm getting `[Errno 32] Broken pipe` and I tried to use this solution I found on stack overflow  but just as was warned in the comments, that made the error go away, but my service just shut down instead; what I'm doing is this...I have two services, a main service for a website and a service for an api. My api gets some data from somewhere else and sends it to my website upon request.; when I hit the api directly, like through a valid route, I get the data and no error; but when I go through my website, which will eventually generate the same url and send a request to my api, I get a broken pipe.; both of the services are running on my computer; when I use the deployed version of the website (AWS), I get no error; only get broken pipe locally
	0.101	0.857	0.043	-0.3313	Can you produce a minimum viable example? Say just the two services running and the web one asking from the service one and failing? Abstractly it sounds like the web process is closing the socket - but hard to know
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.5775	ok...give me a minute to come up with an example, its actually pretty complicated. but I'll try to strip it down the the most important parts
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	None
	0.045	0.749	0.206	0.9268	I'm having a hard time distilling this into a code example. Maybe it would help me to just talk about it abstractly. If you don't mind? For one, what is a  socket, and what would cause it to close/how could I keep it open? I have a feeling that this is the problem; Thank you for your help; reading about sockets here <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm> right now. if you know of any good resources off the top of your head I would love to have them
	0.049	0.746	0.205	0.6369	Sorry it's late my time, so I may be out shortly. I'm hoping someone else familiar with the architecture comes in to help too

What'the updated way to change the admin template? In particular, to either change the /change/ url or to disable editing after initial creation.; I just don't see a `templates` directory at all...

	0.041	0.92	0.038	-0.0516	&gt; The required arguments are an RFC 822 from-address string, a list of RFC 822 to-address strings (a bare string will be treated as a list with 1 address), and a message string.; sendmail's "signature" is something like: `def sendmail(from_addr: str, to_addrs: list, msg: str):`; ; you should transform your string of emails ('<mailto:email1@mail.com|email1@mail.com>, <http://email2.mail.com|email2.mail.com>'), so that it becomes a list with each element being a proper email address
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	So instead of reassigning to a list, perform a split? Like this:

	0.031	0.863	0.106	0.9192	hi guys. anyone here know any solutions to having a python script create a list of objects parallel to another script consuming those objects as they are created?; i’ve got some test automation where each test requires a brand new account, but the accounts take anywhere between 30s-2min to create. i’d like to create the accounts parallel to the tests running to speed up execution time. i’ve found a way using `multiprocessing.Process` and continuously adding accounts to a `multiprocessing.Queue`, but this only works if that process is started from within the same script that executes the tests. i have a use case that requires the test execution to be able to consume a pre-made account as soon as the test starts executing, so `multiprocessing.Process` does not fully solve my problem, since the first test to execute still has to wait for the first account to be created and added to the queue; what would be ideal is a way to create a queue of accounts from a `create_accounts.py` script that i can execute at any time, and then be able to consume that queue at any arbitrary point in time _during_ or _after_ `create_accounts.py`
	0.068	0.748	0.184	0.6639	<@Ray> I wrote a service at a job with similar issues, it basically kept a fresh list of users at all times and tests could "check one out", later the service would clean them up; This is why electron is so popular :(

	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok
	0.148	0.852	0.0	-0.4168	It's not ideal to depend on an external service for tests, this was for the staging env
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.1406	agreed. this is also for our staging env; i don’t envision the service being used outside of the tests, but i do need it to be able to be run independently of running the tests themselves

	0.238	0.762	0.0	-0.3612	<@Myong> why not `pyenv`?; oh.. right &gt;.&lt;; ignore me...
	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.1511	But do use `pyenv` to handle multiple versions!; Brew has caused me a number of issues when it updates

	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	Definitely understood
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you’ve had issues with brew and pyenv <@Beula> ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula> should I just make up another `virtualenv` and put 3.5.whayeber on it then install reqs?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	was it postgres? i had an issue and fixed it by upgrading psycopg2.
	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.6705	Just `brew` managing my python install. For example when 3.6.2 came out and I updated, it killed a bunch of virtualenvs that were looking at the 3.6.1 executable; Sounds reasonable <@Myong>
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.296	oh ok; yea i use pyenv now for that. the psycopg2 thing is the only issue i’ve had so far.
	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	good old windows

	0.058	0.758	0.184	0.6093	It works!! For some reason os.remove(item) is giving me error saying it's used by another process but I just have to delete the files. Thank you so much!
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.2732	I believe what he is doing is trying to create a single executable to distrubute
	0.03	0.929	0.042	0.1901	trying to pull the database <http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/> what would be the best bet in picking the database? PostgreSQL or MongoDB; I figured that there is a relation between the dumped data from multiple .txts which would immediately push me to use Psql but I wonder if Mongo can perform fairly if I am able to handle the co-relation at the app level with decent db-search
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.6369	I’d do postgres; data is structured; and if you’re going to do spatial queries, postgis is the best option
	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.296	<@Beula> got it all set up, gonna try pyinstaller; no issues with 3.5.3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That emoji must be 20 years old; Should I bundle the `config.yaml` or just place in the same dir or it does the same thing anyways

	0.182	0.474	0.344	0.6249	okay that's what I thought; yay no errors after 2 seconds this time; uh oh, the `.exe`just exits; yay
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.4019	You may need a special flag for a UI based app
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this pyinstaller-related?

	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.4588	Two modules, one uses `openpyxl` and populates an excel workbook with some data, another is just a single popup window for a notification that the file has finished being generated

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is that why?

	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.395	I remember there was some entity called `_MEIPASS2` but I didn't mess with it at all; <https://pastebin.com/Xihf4DdV>; My build.spec for pyinstaller
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I believe it's for `--onefile` flag; let me link to my python dir in `pathex`...; It's trying to pull python 3.5 dll from my build directory.; <@Suellen> should the python35.dll be in that build directory?; why is my specfile being overwritten every single time
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	there should be a single exe file
	0.093	0.842	0.066	-0.0808	I'm just trying to point the .exe to find the python35.dll; But everything I am doing isn't working; Well, may have found my problem; Does anyone have any clue why Pyinstaller chooses to overwrite my specfile every time I save it then run again; `binaries=[('C:\\Users\\kybowman\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\python35.dll', 'python35.dll')],`
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	thank you <@Johana>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the specfile is generated for you to edit and use instead of passing parameters to pyinstaller
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	It creates a spec unless you run it from a spec.
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	i.e. you create a spec and then do `pyinstaller main.spec`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Instead of specifying the .py file specify .spec
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why would you need to do that? I didn't have to do anything along those lines to distribute Windows compiled scripts.
	0.098	0.86	0.042	-0.3751	I have absolutely no clue; Not sure what else needs to go in there to not get missing Python35.dll; The dll is literally in there with the `.exe` and it's attempting to pull it from somewhere else; Found a google group post regarding `vcredist`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you compiling on Windows?
	0.106	0.841	0.053	-0.296	Yeah; I'm still wondering about the MEI thing because what happens is when I run it it says the DLL can't be found in c:/.../temp/pyinstaller/_MEIxxxx/python35.dll; No I am not at all; I have no clue where it gets that path from
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pyinstaller with the onefile flag should really be including that with it.; That path is where your files are extracted to.;   This is what I've used to access included files, such as textfsm templates.
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.2869	Where should this go?; Top of main file?; Or hook
	0.132	0.868	0.0	-0.5267	No, you use that in your open lines.; Example: ; But, with your missing dll, something else is going wrong.; Have you tried to compile something simple to see if that works?
	0.0	0.609	0.391	0.5423	Yes I'm using a simple helloworld.py script it works fine
	0.084	0.916	0.0	-0.4772	That's really weird. The only issues I ran into with pyinstaller were that it wasn't ready for 3.6 and I had to use the dev version, and with one of my tools for some reason it couldn't figure out the imports so I had to manually specify every single import.
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.4767	Yeah I had to downgrade to 3.5.3; Okay so given the code to grab the _MEIPASS envar, where exactly do I need to be putting the code within open lines
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The function I gave you is if you need to open an included file. For example if you have templates or html you include in the package.; You can't use that for the python dll, because nothing is going to happen without that dll.
	0.19	0.734	0.077	-0.4981	Yeah makes sense. But I just dont get this error at all. I've found so many posts on it in 2 hours and I'm just lost
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How do you have pyinstaller installed?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	through pip
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In a virtual environment?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	Yes
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.2732	Well, you could make a short script that prints the location of the MEIPASS directory then pauses for input, then go there and see what is extracted. I don't know if it extracts the dll file and libraries there or not though.
	0.178	0.692	0.13	-0.2008	something like print(sys.MEIPASS); oh man i might have got it. closing my eyes one sec; NOPE. sweet; Well I think i give up for now before I go crazy; <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1566> I'm giving up for now

	0.182	0.676	0.142	-0.1531	Well I just sent you the relevant code for the problem; I was having
	0.036	0.92	0.044	0.1179	lines 145 and 148 (and I'm sure others in the code you didn't post) call main(). Are you also calling main() at the bottom near/next to menu()? No, right? Otherwise you'd get dup menu().; so try `if __name__ ....` to call `main()`. and use `main()` to start you off and maintain control of flow/logic, and when to quit.
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	Ok I'll try that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Susanne> This is just an example of how I've done this in the past <https://github.com/khdc-me/PracticePython_org/blob/master/Exercise032.py> NOTE: There are a lot of things that I would change if I had to redo this game, but it can serve as a basic guide for what you are trying to do. Again, don't follow this outright, but use it for ideas.
	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.1531	so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?

	0.0	0.766	0.234	0.4696	Yes I did? so how are you able to call main then?
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.5574	it just does.; so this way, main() runs if this is run as a script... a stand-alone script.; like, you create a hello world and run it from terminal by `python helloworld.py` 
	0.042	0.88	0.078	0.2944	careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'; I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.; You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.; Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.5859	And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?
	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.1531	It doesnt even run I get nothing; I run and then it stops
	0.0	0.619	0.381	0.5106	yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I wasn’t at all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn’t run if __name statement
	0.206	0.666	0.128	-0.1316	No I haven't; Well I believe i have been this entire time; Where would you recommend calling the lists?
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.2168	where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.574	Well 129 is just a print statement; So I can make it a little more clear if anything
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	109*
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Again it's still a print statement; I'm deleting the list item by the index
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.6553	Line 109 says: `num = int(input("Which book would you like to find?"))`; Line 129 says `num = int(input("Which book would you like to sell?"))`; that's user input, not a print statement.
	0.33	0.472	0.198	-0.34	Oh my bad; Well that would work
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.8101	<@Susanne> Can you show what you're trying to get data out of? Normally it's just `dictionary['key_to_get']` to get the value out; There's also the view method if you want to see the available keys: `dictionary.keys()`; Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?; First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there; But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but i isn’t going to print out; I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.3612	Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict; If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.4019	‘float’ object is not iterable; that was the error I got
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Looking <@Susanne>; just a minute
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.308	0.692	0.0	-0.4588	What line is the error in the stacktrace <@Susanne>; `enumerate(options)`; sorry
	0.0	0.723	0.277	0.5574	ok then what would I put if I wanted to print out he key and value?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would continue using options correct?
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.296	Yep; You can grab it from options, which is a list of tuples `[(key, value)] -&gt; [("Movie Name", float_val)]`; So `options[i][0]` and `options[i][1]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It says “list indices must be integers or slices, not str”; thats the snippet I ran
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The question you need to ask yourself is which thing in that snippet can give you a string that is used in `options`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the str function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You aren't using the `str` function; The issue is that you are passing a `str` as an index
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you use int?
	0.0	0.79	0.21	0.6199	ok; Now how would validate the input?; at least what would be the thing I am looking for in the while statement?
	0.054	0.946	0.0	-0.0516	I'll leave that to you for a little to try out, let me know if you hit your head on it too long
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	while i not in range(options)?
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4215	that is true; I got this “‘list’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer”
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And which thing in that is a `list`?
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.2144	<@Denna> <@Beula> (sorry for the days-late response). Yes. My app is in installed apps and the admin panel is fully accessible and usable, but with the generic user model

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ah
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.3612	Sounds like you need to wait to build the GUI until after the input has happened
	0.06	0.905	0.035	-0.3612	Well if that were the case, in tkinter I would need multiple mainloops because all the Frames in a single mainloop are built before any single Frame shows to a user; And multiple mainloops means multiple screens; Guess I just chose a crappy GUI framework to begin with, compared to the rest at least...; I'll go ahead with the manual option
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.296	You probably need to change the UI from within an event, called from the main loop; But yeah, tkinter is not exactly 21st century stuff
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.7003	Yup, good times with the 1900s, good times

	0.0	0.959	0.041	0.4137	<@Dennis> What's your programming experience level? Are you fully new to programming, or know another language?; Because `i` is set to the last index in the loop because python has function scoping, meaning that any variable defined within the function body (even nested scopes) will be available in the function.  It appears you need to use `num` rather than `i` to get the value from options

	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.6476	No worries!
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	<@Staci>; something like this
	0.043	0.889	0.067	0.2247	<@Jed> what is your expected output? this is a little confusing. Not fulling understanding what you are doing, returning total_seconds like that is only going to return total_seconds of the last iteration of that for loop
	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.4213	<@Jed>, check out `.map` and `.apply` to make your life a little easier!

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah got it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but, doing that doesn't give you any validations with manually calling `json.loads`, so you get other issues there.; You can just the built in django forms, and just use forms so you get the validation logic
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but json.loads will work this way... django is a backend for an app and the client wants to use jwt i.e. json only to communicate
	0.0	0.771	0.229	0.8957	jwt is a bearer token format, it doesn't indicate the app is json only; but it's okay if that's the way you want to communicate. In that case if this is a big api - you may want to try out django-rest-framework; It'll save you a lot of manual work like that
	0.0	0.945	0.055	0.2144	yes I'm getting user token with it but he wants additional features so I'm mimicking the input &gt; output format; I would try that but this is a small project and I'm keeping it simple
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.3802	Please use code formatting (either triple ticks on both sides ` ``` `, or the snippet feature which is available with the little plus to the left of the code input box)!; But `"{'user-type': 'user', 'username':'john', 'password':'john2', 'email': '<mailto:john@email.com|john@email.com>', 'first-name':'john', 'last-name':'smith'}"` is invalid json; You need to swap the quotes you use; `'{"user-type": "user", "username": "john", ...}'`
	0.0	0.3	0.7	0.7906	awesome it worked; thanks <@Beula>
	0.0	0.303	0.697	0.3182	sure thing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is that reasonable though? Maybe it's me who should rethink what the documentation should be used for.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> it's unusual to write a non-api documentation in the source code
	0.049	0.9	0.051	0.0258	<@Collette> Why? If I write valid rst docstrings for private functions they can be used by other tools; I suppose that one of the reasons I care about this is that sphinx won't pass over my private functions by default, and thus I won't get any indication of rst syntax warnings/errors in my private functions, so they'll likely be broken and not noticed
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	well in this case they shouldn't be private
	0.046	0.897	0.057	0.1027	But sometimes the gritty details needs an explanation/overview, and that might as well be in rst, right? That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be private. Equating private with "doesn't need docstring" seems weird to me
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.3612	I agree with <@Lanita> . Documentation isn't just for end-users; it's for coworkers. Or myself, in future.
	0.0	0.966	0.034	0.2732	In my case, my sphinx documentation is 100% for co-workers that can code, and that will probably continue to be the case for some time.; But the thing is, my coworker might as well read the code to begin with, so maybe it makes sense to only declare the interfaces, given how readable raw rst is and python's readability in general...
	0.365	0.449	0.186	-0.4215	I disagree; "read the source" is a poor substitute for good documentation
	0.0	0.835	0.165	0.9301	That is what people *say*, but in reality, do people work like that? It's one thing to use a library, but when you're adding functionality to a codebase?; The reason I'm saying this is that my coworkers seem to be the people that prefers to read the source code directly, but maybe they're just used to an environment without documentation... sigh.; <@Ciera> I suppose I want a general discussion on how documentation is to be used, which I suppose would fit better in random. Oh well.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> because api changes, but general ideas and core functionality often doesn't change
	0.0	0.727	0.273	0.8402	Source code and documentation go hand in hand. If I have documentation, I'll go there first. It also helps to communicate intent _far_ quicker than reading code does.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Because when you try to express everything in __doc__, `help(obj)` becomes unreadable
	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.1226	<@Collette> , so you leave off private functions entirely in your fancy-looking documentation? (e.g. sphinx)
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4019	Yes. That's why they're private; I can include them into a "how to read the source code" guide though
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.644	<@Collette> that certainly seems like a sensible approach, and probably the most applicable to my use case. But it does push other developers towards "read the source" fairly quickly. Which I suppose is what is happening in my organization anyways.; So, defining __all__ in every python file is a reasonable idea, I presume? Any places where I shouldn't be doing that?
	0.078	0.865	0.057	-0.2023	Well, you can't cover everything with docs. Sometimes you have to hijack the library and do dirty stuff. That's why I often write "how to read the source code" guides; But still, `__all__` is a must
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Seems reasonable. Any pointers (blog posts, whatever) on how to write such guides? At what level should they be?; I usually use the top-level docstring to explain intent, and that usually includes mentions of both public and private functions. Though should I consider the top-level docstring to be public or private?
	0.026	0.929	0.045	0.3851	I put them in docs, not in `__doc__`. I try to explain the flow of a single successful request, how it goes from the entry point to the handler. And how you can hijack various parts of the handler if they aren't specified as the public api; If the intent of the library isn't clear, or the module names aren't obvious for a novice reader, I often document where's the entry point and if there is some private stuff that gets overridden by children classes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping>; <@Cassaundra> also, can you show a page you're scraping?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Suellen> The Website i'm trying to scrape is <https://munchery.com/menus/sf/#/0/dinner>

	0.033	0.822	0.144	0.8426	Simple one off question that I’ve thought too much about: I made a website in Django that does a whole bunch of different things for me as a teacher, like gradebooks, assigning math problems to specific students, doling out digital awards, scraping the sites we use, sending parent letters, etc. When I describe it quickly to actual developers/programmers, what’s the easiest way to describe something like that? Website? App? Program? What’s the usual term for a django site?
	0.019	0.931	0.051	0.5719	You're bordering on a "LMS" (Learning Management System) - but I usually just say "site".  In my anecdotal experience:  1. site/website -&gt; normal web application 2. webapp -&gt; borders on 1, but usually this gets more into more client side stuff, or an SPA type setup with an API and more functionality than the standard forms of a site 3. program -&gt; pretty vague, could be website, desktop app, etc. 4. app -&gt; often mobile specific  But given a little context anyone will catch your drift
	0.0	0.812	0.188	0.8899	Interesting, so teaching websites like mine have their own acronym? Good to know; Webapp is what I’ve been shooting for. Thanks!

Looks like they just throw that in a cache like redis, cacheddb, or memcached; may be worth listing the keys in whichever it's hooked up to; <https://sorl-thumbnail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirements.html>; From their _how it works_ page:  &gt; When you use the thumbnail template tag sorl-thumbnail looks up the thumbnail in a Key Value Store. The key for a thumbnail is generated from its filename and storage. The thumbnail filename in turn is generated from the source and requested thumbnail size and options. If the key for the thumbnail is found in the Key Value Store, the serialized thumbnail information is fetched from it and returned. If the thumbnail key is not found there sorl-thumbnail continues to generate the thumbnail and stores necessary information in the Key Value Store.  I am not familiar with the lib, but it appears to cache all thumbs

	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.4574	What is `somelist`?; typically, if you’re trying to perform calculations on `Series`objects, you can use `.map` so in your case `table.col1.map(some_function_you_wrote(value))`; Ah I understand now.; yes!

	0.12	0.88	0.0	-0.834	Quick question:; why does this print letters instead of a word?; Nevermind, I'm an idiot; should be using .split(); Does anyone do codewars?; I'm having an issue with this one: <https://www.codewars.com/kata/playing-with-digits/train/python>; All my tests pass, except the last one when I try to submit; I get this response from the test: "None should equal 12933"; Which appears to be some kind of error, unless I'm missing something; Actually, I think I got it.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does anyone know how I can check if an instgarm token is invalid, and if so, prompt the user to reauth on the front end?
	0.028	0.972	0.0	-0.1232	<@Shonda> not sure if you fixed this already, but I think you should be able to just try to get the users profile info and that'll be enough to tell you. Another option is to just keep track since per the oauth2 spec you should have gotten the expiration when they logged in

	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.4019	if there is any spaces in the path; I think that causing some problems
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	use single quotes?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the new path is not there
	0.0	0.678	0.322	0.6908	sweet :+1: you maybe coulda symlinked it too; might help incase it ever updates
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its alread symlinked
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yea I realized that after, I switched the order
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Staci> fwiw, you don't need the `key` in your call to `sorted`. What you have is the default behavior anyway.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kanesha> have you seen <https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey/issues/65#issuecomment-313309037>; `If you're running Python &gt;= 3.5, you should be able to just pip install it and be on your way. All deps should auto resolve.`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what should PYTHONPATH point to?
	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.1695	<@Tameika> you shouldn't touch it; Forget that exists
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	`find / -name pyconfig.h`; `find /usr/include/ -name pyconfig.h` is probably better
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	yes, did that. its not there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Have you installed `python-dev` package?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let me check; is it python-devel for mac?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How did you install python on your mac? Are you using built-in one?
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.4019	i have both python2 and python3; i am using the built in one for python2 (currently working on that for boost python); i also did: `brew reinstall python`
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.2263	Okay, then you need to run `xcode-select --install` to install the development headers
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats the whole command?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	Yes
	0.172	0.828	0.0	-0.4019	`xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates`
	0.142	0.769	0.089	-0.3182	By the way, re-using the pre-installed python is probably a bad idea. I'd go with `brew` version of python; Yeah, that's why
	0.127	0.873	0.0	-0.2912	oh, how do i find if it is pre-installed or from brew?; actually i am not quite sure
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If `which python` points to homebrew's bin, then it was installed by brew
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.296	ok, i found pyconfig.h is actually here : /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7; which python actually points to here : `/usr/bin/python`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Then you're using the pre-installed python
	0.286	0.714	0.0	-0.5574	shit; should I follow this and remove the entire framework <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22774529/what-is-the-safest-way-to-removing-python-framework-files-that-are-located-in-di>
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.3839	Don't mess with your system; Also you probably haven't read the question carefully - it's about pythons installed neither by brew or system
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Start from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7375583>; Then try to include paths to the brew's python headers for cmake explicitly
	0.0	0.937	0.062	0.296	ok, I ran `which -a python` and understood that there is only one version of python at `/usr/bin/python`; so, either 1. i did not use brew to install python; or 2. brew installed python at `/usr/bin`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What `brew ls -v python` says?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	many files in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do you have `/usr/local/bin` in your PATH, as SO answer suggests? Have you read that answer?
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4019	yes, it has higher priority over others; echo $PATH gives me this : `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do you have `python` in `/usr/local/bin`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	seems to be linked files?
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4215	yes, they're all linked to the Cellar; `lrwxr-xr-x  1 seanjohnson  admin  34  7 Jul 14:35 /usr/local/bin/python -&gt; ../Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python`; should just be a matter of putting `/usr/local/bin/` in your path then
	0.111	0.779	0.111	0.0	yes, -- it is already in my path. `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; still, i get the error ; any thoughts on why this is the case?
	0.043	0.901	0.056	0.1531	it's confusing as to why `/usr/local/bin/python` is not showing up for `which python`; though both the system and brew python should be able to find `pyconfig.h`; `/usr/bin/python-config` and `/usr/local/bin/python-config` should both return valid include directories that have `pyconfig.h` in them; like so: ; 
	0.116	0.741	0.143	0.128	Yes, I have the same output; ; not for the second one; ; why is there no file : `/usr/local/bin/python-config` ?
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.1779	weird
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can I just modify PYTHONPATH somehow?; that was my first question; but was told to not touch it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	PYTHONPATH has nothing to do with your issue
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.296	yeah, it's the path for finding imports, your issue is finding headers for boost's C++ compilation; how are you installing boost.python domarps?
	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.4019	`brew install boost-python`; i went ahead and ran this command : ; and when I run make now, it gives me the following error; ; from here : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19810940/ubuntu-linking-boost-python-fatal-error-pyconfig-cannot-be-found>
	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.4767	generally trying to shove these things from external environment variables tends to go poorly, you could try passing the output of `python-config2 --cflags` to your g++ command; though i'd probably advise reinstalling your python brew itself because something is wrong from the very start if your path is not picking up  `/usr/local/bin/python`; and just to confirm, this is trying to compile a program that uses python-boost, and not compiling python-boost itself?
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.4574	yes, true!; just running Hello World from here : <https://github.com/TNG/boost-python-examples/tree/master/01-HelloWorld>
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.296	ohhh; yeah this is all wrapped up and handled in `build.sh`; do you get this output in build.sh: 
	0.0	0.942	0.058	0.1531	yeah, but since I wanted to try each module on my own for a different project, I went ahead and ran `cmake .` in HelloWorld; just let me run build.sj
	0.037	0.88	0.084	0.3612	yeah that's your main issue then; there's output from `build.sh` that shows what arguments `cmake` is expecting; though there appears to be some stuff that the root CMakeLists.txt does for preprocessing some examples; `cmake` is smart enough to know not to recompile things that have changed though, so you can edit the `01-HelloWorld` example as much as you want and `build.sh` will only recompile the projects that have changed
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i see; let me re-do this from scratch
	0.0	0.418	0.582	0.6784	ok -- thank you so much!!!

	0.071	0.767	0.162	0.2846	good day mates, someone familiar with django signals here. I created a User object but i want to trigger my own signal function when after my object has been created and pass some additional argument do you have any work around with this.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi folks, I’m working with uploadedFile from django, basically its just an file object. I need to check the file header before going any further process with the file.

	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.128	specific formulas are no-go, alright, but what about suggestions?
	0.017	0.896	0.087	0.7003	<@Suellen> I think the observation was that if you specify a formula, you're telling crackers the formula too. And since humans tend to work similarly it actually gives them a leg up. People tend to put capitals at the start. They tend to put "special symbols" and numbers at the end. Etc. If you just leave it free form then it is less likely those predictable patterns emerge
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And they swap in numerals for letters sometimes -&gt; `Password1` -&gt; `P4ssword1`
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.296	yeah, that makes sense, and that's exactly what I've been doing before keepass
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The lookups are simple, lots of rainbow tables do that; But basically, require a length. For normal users discourse does 10char, for admins 15char

	0.247	0.471	0.282	0.0772	which is by itself a security risk
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think the idea is _up to_ 256 characters. With most online web apps you can just use a varchar or equivalent
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	good thing postgres doesn't enforce length on varchars
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Suellen> You hash the password so it gets down to a predictable, probably fixed, length anyway
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://stackoverflow.com/a/4849030/1584762>
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.4902	`varchar` without `max_length` is a `text` as far as pg is concerned; so that's good
	0.121	0.779	0.1	-0.2263	&gt; To sum it all up: &gt;  &gt; char(n) – takes too much space when dealing with values shorter than n, and can lead to subtle errors because of adding trailing spaces, plus it is problematic to change the limit &gt; varchar(n) – it's problematic to change the limit in live environment &gt; varchar – just like text &gt; text – for me a winner – over (n) data types because it lacks their problems, and over varchar – because it has distinct name
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	although, why am I even talking about database types, when you shouldn't be storing them in the DB... let me get some more caffeine before I say anything else

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> NSCS/GCHQ (UK) is officially recommending password managers now, also mentioned in Troy's post

	0.048	0.907	0.045	-0.0258	did you hear the sad story of scrypt? it's not the story infosec people would tell you...; it was invented and named "better bcrypt", but wasn't used much; and starting to use scrypt now wouldn't make much sense because of argon2
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.2732	I was just looking through the django docs on what they use by default - and they suggest argon2 as well
	0.125	0.811	0.064	-0.3818	oh cool; wait, is there a python implementation / bindings?; I searched for it, but only found a lonely github repo and it wasn't updated much; `argon2_cffi`
	0.0	0.662	0.338	0.5574	Looks like that's the one they link to as well: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/passwords/#using-argon2-with-django>

	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4939	&gt; . The Password Hashing Competition panel, however, recommends immediate use of Argon2 rather than the other algorithms supported by Django.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what went on with scrypt?
	0.246	0.754	0.0	-0.8579	Saw the password stuff from earlier. So much of the web, and business, is doing passwords so wrong. If there is a length limitation it is scary, because length doesn't matter much if it is hashed anyway.
	0.433	0.567	0.0	-0.7269	or you're dealing with a crappy legacy system; and/or clueless management
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.34	Length does matter with hashing, each additional character increases the hash entropy significantly - as far as I understand it; Sure the end hash is the same length
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I meant with storage.
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	Ah; ok

	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.0772	<@Donnetta>  &gt; course or training on python with facebook can you give an example of what you want to do?
	0.119	0.881	0.0	-0.8315	i would suggest: <https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/>; I am new to “facebook with python”. My main intention is to delete/post  photos and posts with a python script. I have been trying for this, but i m not successful. I was only able to read/get one post and it might be very difficult to get all posts in this manner reading one post by post. So thinking on a course or tutorial.
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.5719	<@Donnetta>, I suggest spending some time learning how to navigate the graph API. Facebook now has excellent documentation how to do this and they also have a graph explorer tool where you can directly query their server and view responses.; <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/#deleting>; <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api/#reading>; <https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Winnifred> Thats what exactly i have been trying from the beginning, but in the links that you gave, there is nothing on python, how can I integrate those GET commands with python?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You can construct the calls using <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>.
	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.6124	<@Winnifred> this should help.. i will give it a try. <@Shelly> thank you. I will look on it too.. Thank you both.
	0.0	0.945	0.055	0.296	There is a little bit of a learning curve on how to use `requests`, but if you use the URL structure in the facebook docs and supply the right auth credentials, you should be able to `GET` and `POST` just fine.

	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.4939	_not_ a good idea; because a primary key needs to be unique; thats why its typically an integer or UUID; _why_ do you want the PK to be for the first name?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	_why_?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if this is not gonna be readable by whoever is using it, just use the built in PK field; a simple integer as a unique identifier seems much simpler

	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.4939	if you’re familiar with web dev, django is pretty analogous to angular; and flask with react/vue

	0.039	0.815	0.146	0.7796	Anyone have any issues with the latest requests package and connecting to SSL?; I.e., requests.get('<https://www.google.com>') gets a CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED error?; On an EC2 instance (RHCE) I get this with a clean venv with the latest requests (2.18.3), but not with a clean venv with a slightly older one (2.13); But on my Mac, clean venv with the latest requests work; Really weird
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's working on my ubuntu laptop with `2.18.3`
	0.0	0.48	0.52	0.6705	Yeah, like it said it's fine on my Mac
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe certificates that needs updating ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Python on the EC2 is 2.7.5; It uses certifi for the certs
	0.247	0.753	0.0	-0.3182	is it not a case of google's anti botting ?
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.3182	And I tested the cert file with openssl on the command line and it worked; I.e., it has a fresh cert file packaged - it doesn't use the system cert
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does curl work ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Tandra> Don't know why that would only affect the newer version and only on the EC2 instance; <@Ciera> Let me try
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if the ip has hit the url too many times it could potentially lock it out is what i meant
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But openssl AND slightly older requests work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hence why it works elsewhere
	0.075	0.753	0.172	0.4215	for a request to google homepage I think you should hit it pretty hard to be locked out
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	Yeah; Curl works
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.2732	well so I guess it's something in `requests`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Need to figure out how to get more info
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.3818	Need the raw request, I guess; Going to see if I can dump the full request
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you update to newer python?; I mean, 2.7.5 _is_ fairly old
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yeah
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	try to up the log level; requests is supporting 2.6 so it should work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	probs related: <https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/52>; `requests` updated their `certifi` dependency @ version 2.14 (after working 2.13)

	0.119	0.717	0.164	0.2187	Likely not. lol; My book is pretty niche ; Sort of a how to put flask into production 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea i had my own ideas in that area too. we’ll have stuff for the community at some point.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4215	Nice 
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.4939	i got an email about this today. it seems pretty good.; <http://python101.pythonlibrary.org/>
	0.0	0.74	0.26	0.8591	That book does look good. I got a free copy when he gave it away on Reddit last year, and have bookmarked the link since he posted it online for free now.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That may have been how I ended up using ConfigObj for everything, I think.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I know. And so many of the classes are outdated or poorly done.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for work i can see being sent to some training.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I've been doing this for 18 months, I think, and that book still has things I've not done.
	0.073	0.659	0.267	0.743	humblebookbundle recently did a bunch of python books, can't wait to get stuck into them. the resources for learning are pretty awesome
	0.223	0.602	0.176	-0.1388	i really liked violent python, but it was in python-2.x
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.0387	i have that but haven't read it yet, does it matter if it's py2 specific?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	these days it isn’t a stretch to go py2 to py3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats what i was thinking too
	0.106	0.67	0.223	0.4522	lol. mostly because of how stubborn you used to be on using 2. so now its more habit and amusing.
	0.0	0.725	0.275	0.6486	lol; back when i was mostly webscraping using urllib.. i didn’t like that i had to decode it in 3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you should just write your own version of that book in python 3 (with async of course) and make it forward compatible with python 4
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there a big thing between py2 and 3 still?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as far as i know, just a differences in the imports / things being bytes instead of strings
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not as much anymore.; theres more differences underneath. but most arent too much of an issue. unless you are Zed Shaw
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also, isn’t 3.6 when lists and dicts were ordered?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	dicts, lists are always ordered
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	there were _technically_ ordered before. it just wasnt garanteed
	0.0	0.562	0.438	0.6652	yeah but better not based your code on that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^ thats what i meant
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's now garanteed but subject to change as it's an implementation detail
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea you shouldnt; yea
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i don't know if they are in PyPi
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	yes they are; thats where they got the new code from
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	would there ever be a reason for it to be unordered ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they stoled it
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	seems like a step backwards if that ever happens
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	speed I guess
	0.177	0.823	0.0	-0.0191	speed should never matter though surly?
	0.0	0.7	0.3	0.4588	i think it was still an improvement if I recall
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.6124	dict speed is pretty important as almost everything is a dict in python
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.25	it was an improvement but I'm talking about the future
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe someone will find a new algorithm much faster but that isn't ordered
	0.0	0.659	0.341	0.3802	3.6 has a ton of dict improvements!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup.
	0.0	0.559	0.441	0.743	yeah there are great talks from raymond hettinger about them
	0.0	0.677	0.323	0.7344	they got a lot from pypy too. so hopefully, it will help them catch up faster
	0.18	0.82	0.0	-0.296	if you are on 3.5 no reason to not use 3.6
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	hettinger has a lot of good talks anyways
	0.0	0.593	0.407	0.6705	with their funding pypi is improving a lot their python 3 support
	0.0	0.457	0.543	0.8591	yea. thanks to Mozilla.; they got intitial 3.5 support super fast
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.6369	That's a company I would love to work with
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	same.
	0.206	0.422	0.372	0.2399	yeah but not sure it's financially stable enough
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.2263	i have heard redhat is nice to work for too. i technically applied recently, but never heard anything.; i dont think it is yet
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.1531	heh
	0.182	0.714	0.104	-0.296	yeah but it's all based on donation. It can stop at any time

	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.296	You need to provide more context <@Elanor> , with what you've shown there is next to no context
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.34	I don't have any headers imported in Python , I only import shared libraries

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Steve> this is typically a place for generic python questions or if there isnt a more specific place to ask your question if it's about a particular library or topic (such as <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, <#C07EYDP25|webdev>, <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning>, etc.)
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6369	cool thanks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you have 3 files as follows : `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py27.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py34.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.so`; How do I link the `libboost_python-py34.so`to `-lboost_python`?
	0.208	0.731	0.061	-0.7236	Hm, how terrible of an idea is it to use classes as a sort of symbol, instead of using an enum?  Something like this:  ; Stringly typed functions suck and there's no native symbols type AFAIK(?)
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.4767	<@Lanita> your conditions are all wrong. `if isinstance(action, FireTheMissiles)` is the correct one
	0.06	0.74	0.2	0.6249	<@Collette>, no, I'm not instantiating the State classes; Let's make it like this or something:    ...to make sure that nobody tries instantiating the symbols; a bit like how None is not callable
	0.059	0.818	0.123	0.34	Ah, sorry, yes. Hm, is there a way to signify a non-instantiated class?; type(WaitAround) is `&lt;class 'type'&gt;` so I guess that'd be weird...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why use a class for that and not a string or whatever ?
	0.197	0.803	0.0	-0.4019	ovv, an error in stringly typed code won't be detected until runtime
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's `Type[State]`, but I'd go with enums
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with this, you would have some file symbols.py where you'd import all the "symbols" you're using
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.8173	Ah, now I remember, the problem with enum is that until 3.6 there was no built-in way to automatically generate enums. Also, the syntax in 3.6 is really ugly either way
	0.428	0.234	0.339	-0.1926	Ugly? What's a better syntax?
	0.036	0.8	0.164	0.8752	ah, after looking at it, Enum seems like a much better choice; malinoff, having one auto() for every new possible value is really ugly; The syntax is clearly a compromise for python not having proper enums to begin with; maybe something like...  sym FIRE_THE_MISSILES sym WAIT_AROUND StateEnum = SymbolCollection("StateEnum", FIRE_THE_MISSILES, WAIT_AROUND)  (assuming that this was implemented way earlier, of course). This would allow symbols "on their own" as well as a collection of symbols. Perhaps that might as well be a list though, it really depends on how you're using enums to begin with

	0.0	0.947	0.053	0.4404	you need to define `test_software`, etc inside `class_unit_test.setUp`; because the unit test instanciates the class; so anything you do outside it, in the context of a unit test, will not exist; in other words, use `setUp` to define variables you need for the test; also, you need better naming for your class and variables

	0.0	0.837	0.163	0.3612	ok, so mine was subtly different: 3.400 became 3.400, normalize takes 3.400 to 3.4. But that's usually what I want anyway

	0.116	0.819	0.066	-0.2919	Oh, right, good point.; if version: import module; Though, if the script is to work on the old version, are you subbing in a different module for the old version? Otherwise shouldn't you want it to fail the unit test?
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4019	the syntax error is only in the test; in the module itself I made an if based on the version
	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	What is the syntax error?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's for an asynchronous context manager

	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.7151	In a class though? Oh, I can't imagine that not being ugly.  Perhaps inherit from the 3.4 safe class in the 3.5/6 class in the other file?
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	yeah that could work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Isn't the 3.4 syntax just `@asyncio.coroutine` on the function and `yield from` instead of `await`?; why do you need 3.4?
	0.079	0.87	0.052	-0.2382	yes it is but there is no syntax for `async with` (that I know of); I don't need it I'm on 3.6 but it was in the library so trying to not take it out

	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.7469	I think the main thing is whether or not you would use the migration features of the ORM; but usually that's fairly separate anyway; for instance you should have no problem using sql-alchemy or pony with an existing database; even if you had been using that database with an existing codebase in a different language previously

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.5411	What have you tried <@Tameika> ? You can get pretty close without deleting any files to prove out your idea!
	0.0	0.953	0.047	0.1531	I actually added all the files to a csv and removed all of them and then copied all the entries in the csv to another folder; ; <@Beula> : here the blacklisted lines actually correspond to the list of files I want to remove; the file name is foo_bar_cat_XXXX_ dog; and I want to check if `XXXX` is in my blacklist
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	if you want to find files matching a wildcard in Python, you could use the glob module. 
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.0772	there’s `iglob` too if you want an iterator; and I think in 3.5+ you can even have it recurse directories for you

	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.0516	or use the command line `pip freeze &gt; /path/to/requirements.txt`
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.4588	Ideally `requirements.txt` should be populated manually, using top-level requirements such as `django`, `requests` and `djangorestframework`. After you have all of that in place, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` once. Then do `pip freeze &gt; requirements.lock.txt`; Then always use `requirements.lock.txt` to install dependencies
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I do a `<http://requirements.in|requirements.in>` where I just list the requirements without versions, then `pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt <http://requirements.in|requirements.in>`; and that maintains the exact versions.

	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.4588	i then use a service called PyUp I think it is to submit PRs when my stuff needs to be updated.; It’s a pretty nice workflow, but yup, just one of a couple possibilities
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But `requirements.txt` contains not only exact versions of dependencies, but exact versions of dependencies' dependencies
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	oh right good point
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's the point of having two different requirements files; In that case, the file with exact versions is often called a "lock" file
	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.9022	a nice thing about the `pip-compile` (not sure if others offer this as well) is it adds comments about where the dependencies come from; yeah I guess that’s a good point, it might be better to use that naming scheme
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.5346	&gt; it might be better to use that naming scheme Unless there's a tool that requires a specific naming, like `pbr` which expects `requirements.txt` file in the root of the repository; (I personally don't like it, I'd rather have a way to explicitly specify the path to requirements in the `setup.cfg`, but I've managed to overcome this by symlinking `requirements/runtime.txt` to `requirements.txt`)

	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.867	<@Scottie>; didn't you find any solution in the internet ?; you can deploy your django project to heroku , it's a free service cloud hosting and storage; hey everyone , this my project deveoped with python; and i need some feedback; <https://github.com/Rebaiahmed/OCR_SIMPLECV>; the project open the webcam , extract text from images captured and analyze it , if it was mathmatical expression it will evaluate it and sound the solution , if it was simple text it will translate it to the Frensh and pronounce it; it's cool ? can i put it in my Resume ?
	0.0	0.594	0.406	0.836	It does look cool, but I would personally clean up the code before sharing it with employers
	0.066	0.692	0.242	0.6808	Hi everyone: We're looking for another maintainer of <https://github.com/zalando/connexion>. If you're interested in helping a popular Python project with code review/responding to potential users/contributors, drop a line ...
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.5267	...that creates a list of x,y position of pixels in an image, separates an area and then I use the positions to render an image...; here's how the image looks; original
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.5574	<@Masako>   I am about to reinvest in python and came across connexion as a tool i could use in creating a security tooling api..
	0.368	0.632	0.0	-0.5423	If this is about python my bad
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4019	I will be looking at it and if things turn out might be willing to help
	0.0	0.962	0.038	0.2732	it's a simple issue though, the rendered image has pixels offset seen on the image; <@Meg> you'll see there's a grayscale image above the one in full color, it shouldn't have the lines and I believe it's because of the way I create and edit positions in javascript then render it in PIL that's bringing black boxes lines
	0.218	0.495	0.287	0.1779	i figured i must be missing some better option
	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.2498	you can look at `contexlib.Exitstack`; but if you only have two it might not be worth it; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>
	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.6369	that does look promising although it looks like i’ll have to depend on the python2 backport
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>; Oh, that's 3.3
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	I use it for 2 levels or more, primarily because flat is generally better than nested
	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.3716	One disadvantage of this usage, is that mocked method will be patched for all test function, but this leads to make them smaller ==&gt; smaller unit test
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.1901	I agree but for only two levels it might make things a bit too complex
	0.0	0.798	0.202	0.4215	I like when you have multiple nested context managers with `if` for the one you want to enter
	0.246	0.754	0.0	-0.2411	not sure, what are you looking for?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why not set patch as decorator to test function?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would use `contextlib.ExitStack`
	0.036	0.772	0.192	0.8268	Hi folks, It might a bit unrelated here. But i’m trying to use an api from other service. They give apikey, password, shared secret. apikey and password alone can help me get access to the api. So why we need an shared secret. I’m working with shopify api. Thanks!
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.836	<@Hermina> - Usually when they give something like a shared secret it's either so your application can validate incoming requests (aka webhooks) or you can sign a payload before sending it to them (so they can validate similarly)

	0.157	0.752	0.091	-0.222	<@Georgetta>  ; not the best demonstration of order, but the idea is to convert it to a normal dict; you lose the benefit of Ordering, but depending on why you need to print it - you might not need it
	0.159	0.786	0.055	-0.8175	Hi All, am trying to trigger a python script using jenkins.. am not able to understand where am going wrong but the build is not getting successful or failure.. it was just keeping on blinking the blue ball saying build in progress.. i kept waiting hours but no response.. where the script am able to execute from command prompt.. having anyone faced kind of problem or any suggestions would be appreciated 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ok> show us your script
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	U mean python script <@Collette> 
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I will try it <@Beula> but am able to execute other python scripts in jenkins
	0.0	0.782	0.218	0.4201	<@Beula> more like the python script is waiting for some input
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Or that
	0.088	0.68	0.231	0.4767	Sorry <@Collette>  its too big script.. ; But its a unit testing kind off
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ok> click on the plus sign to the left from the slack input field, and choose "Add code or text snippet"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> its actually from my office server so i can take that script out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is cant take that script out to here
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I will try as u said <@Beula> by logging to script
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4939	It's a pretty common way to debug, it should often be one of your first actions when you hit an issue
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	first question is. does the scrip try to run ?
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	Yeah since am just new to this world of python and Jenkins thing learning <@Beula> 
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.1603	Script is trying to run, it not throwing any error but just running <@Ciera> 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	As <@Collette> mentioned, are you waiting for an `input` (or `raw_input` in py2) in the code? Any `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`? etc
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Or contains an infinite loop
	0.148	0.639	0.213	0.2302	No there is no input needed.. as i said its running fine in command prompt without error; Only when i integrate in Jenkins causing this error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ok> do you have *any* output?
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yeah the out should be an html file
	0.105	0.781	0.115	-0.1531	Speaking of logging. Is there a good best practice article on how to configure it? I'm getting double messages, but have been too busy dealing with functionality to try to figure out where I went wrong.
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.4215	<@Meghan> You probably just have `propagate` set to true: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate> That will have anything handled by a nested logger bubble up to the ancestors
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	Thanks, I'll take a look.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi Everyone Really need your <#C07EFMZ1N|help> I have deadline coming up for my project demo So can anyone provide with some knowledge on how to go on to build these interactive message buttons for a bot response in slack?; I am using Python for my development
	0.09	0.721	0.189	0.4939	<@Juli> You usually get the best responses here when you have *specific* questions, where are you actually stuck?
	0.0	0.809	0.191	0.9747	Yes so what I have till now is a bot in slack that uses Slackclient/RTM API/Flask for fetching a message in real time from a channel and only if it has certain keywords in the message then the bot responds with a ok message for now!; But what I want to do know is instead of replying with an ok message reply with these interactive message that does some particular action based on the button the user selects; But I am firstly not able to find a good documentation or a step by step guide for going with building this in python; So if anyone can provide me with a good tutorial or documenation or can point me to the right resource for building these in python then it would be a great help! Thanks !
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you new to Python and http?
	0.164	0.754	0.082	-0.5369	Not new to python can write code with python and dealing with data, pandas, os, sys, functions, lists, etc! But not great with web and python so yes struggling with http and web related stuff!
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.2144	Yes <@Beula> I was reading through these yesterday but due to time constraints I was looking for something more narrower that gives an example of how to build one of these with python; There are examples of how to build one with node
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	doesn’t sirbot currently do this?
	0.24	0.623	0.137	-0.1685	Yeah; But that's asyncio based - I wasn't sure if it would be a confusing resource
	0.156	0.844	0.0	-0.3412	But I have not worked with node and was not finding a good documentation with python
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Juli> go take a look at the sirbot source code.. it might be async but the process between your app and slack should be similar.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Let me find a direct link
	0.0	0.641	0.359	0.4215	yea that will probably be easier.
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6597	hmm, well there is the giphy code... but not the router for the events; <@Ciera> - can you point a good link for responding to message buttons from the sirbot repos?
	0.0	0.527	0.473	0.7419	Thanks will have a look! That would be very helpful
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.3612	<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-slack/blob/master/sirbot/slack/dispatcher/action.py#L34>; this is the coroutine that handle incoming `action`; like press on a button; it is then routed based on the `callback_id`; for giphy it is routed to this:<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/pythondev/slack.py#L341>
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.7959	<@Johana> that would be an awesome tutorial! Also I don't think there are many available already. Hopefully even I can contribute to it in a while
	0.0	0.813	0.187	0.3182	you can then respond with a new message or update the original
	0.0	0.489	0.511	0.8879	Thanks <@Ciera> Will look into these; Thanks <@Beula> and <@Johana> as well! Really appreciate that!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea i used that originally for the bot_tutorial but i had to hack it too much to get it to run in a jupyter notebook.
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.5927	I'm late to this, but this library makes working with Slack easy: <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot> <@Juli>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it expects a settings.py file in the root of the dir which is a little outdated nowadays.; if anything the config should look for it and offer another method or use env vars.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://github.com/lins05/slackbot/blob/develop/slackbot/settings.py#L39>
	0.075	0.801	0.125	0.277	oh i guess it does have it.. opened my mouth again.; lol; still kinda not a fan of what was done there.
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.7269	I wrote a bot with it that may be fun, after a discussion in here on Friday. A bot that executes python code from the chat if the tag is included. Of course, it will need a lot of safety checks before it runs the code.
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.6249	<@Meghan>, <@Beula> mentioned having some code that does that. it will setup a docker container and execute. perhaps something like that would work for you. i’m thinking the benefits are you can remove networking, volumes, etc.
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.296	yeah, I should pull that code out of the other project; Can you define "BBD"?
	0.0	0.763	0.237	0.4215	lol; BDD; had to quick scroll away from that link
	0.565	0.435	0.0	-0.0772	ah sorry
	0.191	0.809	0.0	-0.4697	saw a bunch of libs but most dont look like they have much of a community
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.3182	BDD doesn't seem to be huge in python, the only place I have seen it really big is node and ruby
	0.0	0.484	0.516	0.4926	I guess that's a good outcome!
	0.0	0.492	0.508	0.4753	LoL, I’ll take it !
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.2516	It could be done kind of cool with context-managers probably

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jeanette> I use django-debug-toolbar for debugging any django app
	0.116	0.653	0.231	0.3802	I am used to ipdb in the view that's what I miss. Thanks!
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	<@Florene> easy suggestion: run it in foreground; Or use a remote debugger, for example <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/remote-pdb/>
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.0772	that is not possible for the service which i want to debug; would remote-pdb work for Containers too?
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.6124	Yes. Just make sure you have its port published to the host
	0.046	0.893	0.061	0.186	For a string `s`, is there something equivalent to the POSIX tool tr's `tr -s "  " " "`? That is, replace all occurances with double-space with a single space; until there's no double-spaces left;  is OK for my use cases I guess, though re-creating strings all the times is slow
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you shouldn't need a while loop
	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.7717	Please recommend me some good resources on `Design Patterns with Python`
	0.062	0.938	0.0	-0.1154	the coding blocks podcast has done a series on design patterns - mainly specific to C#, VB and Java, but a lot of it still applies

	0.066	0.861	0.073	0.0453	Thanks <@Vada> , I will look into it. Haven't really liked the idea of listening to podcasts appealing but I did subscribe to Software Engineering Daily, last week.
	0.108	0.834	0.057	-0.2411	Yeah that works - although I tend to avoid regex; I tend to listen to them on commutes or when I'm at the gym; or washingup/cooking; times when I'm doing something manual and can't actively use my brain
	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.5859	Cool, recommend some I can hook up to.

	0.167	0.494	0.34	0.2023	hi who want to play with me in hackerrank; solve python problems
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4678	Talk python to me is pretty good for python but more for stories about python instead of how to code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	12k stars, might be legit.
	0.037	0.806	0.157	0.7757	Hello Guys. I just cross searching pythondev in slack community. I am searching for 3days now to move in Python from PHP for our project in Big Data Analytics. I just want to know if Apache Spark is good, and to combine to Django with Python? and what are the advantages and disadvantages? or do you have any other suggestion, I am willing to listen and understand. Thank you
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	For what? As usual, details about use cases are required for suggestions 
	0.061	0.917	0.022	-0.5194	on how it work together, Imean the concept or architecture. because I don’t have yet experience in Python, and my team whole department is planning to move to python; for instance is that possible to use apache spark with django with python. and if that possible to rid the cron and just use rest api using python; I am quite straggle on how I can align my team for this. and we have facing problem with PHP which is not valuable for big data analytics
	0.073	0.816	0.111	0.0098	I'm not sure the tech from the client to the database matters here - normally with spark wouldn't you stream off a read-replica and process the data?
	0.043	0.846	0.111	0.3224	<@Beula> I am not sure yet, because I don’t have experience yet using spark, I just quite in research and deep dive study by next week. but using spark with django is that make sense?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's what I am saying, i don't think the "with X" is relevant
	0.173	0.827	0.0	-0.431	I don't know spark well, but as far as I know you connect spark to a database and run the data transformations off there. What loads that database doesn't matter (PHP, Python, Raw SQL, etc)
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	I think you are correct. thanks <@Beula>
	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.4588	Hello, can I get some help with tensorflow? I'm doing image recognition, and I've seen in different examples that I have to use `tf.gfile.FastGFile(image_path, 'rb').read()` as my image data. But I was wondering if there's a way to use an image in memory instead; I want to use an image in a post request (I'm using Bottle framework)
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.5945	check whether that tensorflow method takes in a file like object; if so, you can create a temp file, read the image into memory and pass it in
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It takes the path of an image. Should I write the file to the disk and then pass that path to the FastGFile class?
	0.175	0.825	0.0	-0.1779	I find it weird it can’t take in a temp file
	0.048	0.952	0.0	-0.2411	I'm not sure of what FastGFile does. Perhaps it just reads a file as I would normally do with python, and adds extra features. I'll try to read it as normal, and pass that as the image data, skipping the FastGFile object
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.6553	hi guys, in which case we should consider using multi processes rather than threads? I think if we have 4 core, we can create 4 processes with might better than 4 threads using one process right? I’m writing script to migrate data from db postgres to other db (elasticsearch)
	0.0	0.642	0.358	0.5994	is what you have currently going super slow?
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	i’m running threads, and few like its quite slow, trying to update it to make it faster
	0.039	0.803	0.158	0.7681	In python we have the gil, which only lets a single thread run at a time. Given that, the only way threads help you in python is io bound things (waiting on network requests). Processes help for cpu bound work, but sharing data is expensive as it makes entire copies to share (since memory space isn't shared in python).
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3291	i’ve never filled elastic search with tons of data but i have done so with postgres. typically in these situations you gotta be careful about your database sessions and want to use a connection pool.
	0.072	0.77	0.158	0.3265	Agreed, I'm not sure how much perf you can really squeze out of a database migration (but since it should be 1 time, that's probably ok 
	0.054	0.688	0.259	0.7534	yea… i agree there sometimes its ok to ensure all the data goes in properly.; i know i’ve done well over 10,000 transactions a second with postgresql. i’m not sure about elastic search.
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.296	yea you might be ok. try it and see what happens.; when i need to do a bunch of database work i just use a work queue.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let us know how it works out.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how can i generate a chart using table in html with matplotlib by using django?
	0.052	0.741	0.207	0.9549	If we want to build a dictionary like this:   Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?   I very often find myself repeating this pattern:     but I'd like to do be able to write it something like    which would return a regular dict, with the `cond1_key` and `cond2_key` keys only present if the first argument of their respective `when` function call is `True`.; when could return the equivalent of `cond1_key : cond1_value`  if the first argument is True, else puts some key: value token of some kind that will be filtered out by cond_build_dict (which is a function that takes a dict and remove all keys containing this token)
	0.0	0.709	0.291	0.7165	&gt; Is there a function `f` that would allow for this? Kinda.; ; so your original example can be written like this: 
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.8519	<@Suellen> yup, that's how I've been doing before; but I'd like to have everything be in one place, to make it visually easier to parse; since it looks and feels more declerative; one built-in option that works if you're okay with keeping the key is simply doing 
	0.25	0.53	0.22	-0.1027	well.. it's easy to cross into "ugly code" territory
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.7188	yeah; what I just wrote wasn't ugly though, but it can quickly get ugly
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.6124	Personally I like the explicit `if` statements. If the dict really does have a variety of different permutations I like that to be explicit in the code
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.4767	short, declarative code in one place is typically easier to read than slowly mutating an object to get to where we want to be
	0.15	0.741	0.109	-0.296	 More real-life example:  This way the key isn't added to the dictionary if the condition is false; but I feel like it's already a bit ugly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you could do a loop on your condition/value
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.1901	I like declarative code, but sometimes it obscures the outcome.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There's a reason we prefer Python over Prolog, after all.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's hacky imo, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	  Any ideas on how to better name things/improve on this?
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	I think a better API would be  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so key is a `Tuple[Any, Any]`?
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.296	yeah; or just an iterable of `[Any, Any]`; that way it's obvious what key you are trying to fill
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	ya. something like  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What would be the resulting dict? I don't get it
	0.123	0.794	0.083	-0.024	malinoff, no extra dict options would leave the default dict, e.g `cond_build_dict(d) == d`; <@Ciera> while that it shorter, it's less clear what's happening I think
	0.279	0.721	0.0	-0.4767	Also, what's exactly wrong with   How it's longer than  ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	those two aren't equivalent; (hm, need to get to lunch... gone for an hour)
	0.106	0.827	0.067	-0.0934	I don't really agree with that but each is own; if you name the function with an adequate name it should be obvious what it is doing and hide how it's doing it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> how so? What's the difference?
	0.362	0.638	0.0	-0.1779	Just gonna hide it...
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.3182	Nuts
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.1779	Well that's what he want. I don't really see the use case but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh my
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I need to `import this` intravenously
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	 Shorter, and more explicit.; and looks a bit like doing `some_dict.get("value", default)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> `get_query_kwargs3` is still just one line shorter than `get_query_kwargs1`, what's the point?
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.4215	it's not all about the number of lines; it's about general readability (both of the entire thing and in diffs) and the ease of changing something
	0.147	0.853	0.0	-0.5667	I am not convinced. I think `get_query_kwargs1` is simple enough to write and to maintain, and `get_query_kwargs3` isn't much better to deserve a tested and battle-proven implementation of `cond_build_dict` and `only_if` functions.
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.8591	I'd say even if solution#2 is 2x better than solution#1, it's better to take solution#1 and start using it or working on something else, than trying to achieve perfection
	0.047	0.71	0.243	0.7964	 is not the same as   in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name. And secondly `only_if` does pretty much look like `stm1 if cond else stm2`, don’t you think so?
	0.129	0.754	0.117	-0.1381	<@Liberty>  &gt; in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name No, the idea was `only_if` to return a sentinel object if the condition is false, so the corresponding key won't be created within `cond_build_dict`
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.6023	oh, yeah, see now, I got to conversation too late and did not notice `cond_build_dict`; sorry, then in this case I would agree with <@Suellen>
	0.0	0.931	0.069	0.5719	I'm trying it out with actual code, and I've figured that... 1. it's shorter, but not that much shorter. It does reduce duplication though 2. it makes it easier to group things by key "theme", but makes it harder to see what things will always be there and what things wont
	0.0	0.801	0.199	0.899	but only if there are lot of conditions  and they are made somewhere else programmatically, then it would make some pretty cool “magic”. But if you only got few of them and they hardcoded there then you should use 1 option, as it’s easier to understand and read.
	0.135	0.829	0.036	-0.5574	I think that you're missing out on the way you actually read code, and what you want from it; But the problem is that writing DSL's in a programming language without a macro language is hard...
	0.278	0.722	0.0	-0.4019	Oh, so that's actually an XY problem; <https://sharknet.us/2014/04/06/stop-creating-dsls/>
	0.054	0.883	0.063	0.091	No, it's fucking not. gaah.; There's nothing wrong with DSL's, if they show up all the time; What I'm doing is representing a schema through code; sql is a DSL. HTML is a dsl. json schema is a dsl. a Dockerfile is a DSL...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Language
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	<@Lanita> that doesn't mean you have to create your own DSL.
	0.118	0.882	0.0	-0.3147	&gt; and hide how it's doing it Aha! So I can use "{...} if cond else {}" after all!
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.0762	Hm, getting this to not hard to use is really hard... Right now I'm at this point:

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	of course
	0.086	0.891	0.023	-0.6101	I asked in Django is there a way I can define a critical section for a whole block of code in Django? I have two services running at the same time and I don't want a "start service" thread running at the same time as a "remove service" thread. However on reflection I feel this might be a more "how to manage concurrency in Python".; is anybody here able to advise please?; I could probably do a hacky way and solve this with updates through the DB
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hi everyone so I was going through this tutorial and <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok> but did'nt quite get the Step 2: Refactor our script to work with Slack has ayone worked for something similar in python?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Juli> are you stick on the slack oauth2 part, or what?
	0.029	0.834	0.137	0.8642	yes <@Beula> I am stucked with the oauth and event subscription part; So my main goal is to create these interactive buttons right! So for that I have to create this slack app and in the request Url i use ngrok followed by a /slackmessage . Now I will have to do two things right. 1. Create an endpoint to handle post request to this request url and then respond to slack and 2. Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right?; Correct me if I am wrong anywhere. This is what I understood; and help in python for the same?
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.34	&gt; Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right  not necessarily. If you have only one team you can do that in the slack app interface
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.4137	Then how is client id, client secret and verification token etc come into play here?; It works without authentication?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can find them in your app page; after you install it on your dev team
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Because in this blog also the author said it did'nt work for her without authentication so i thought its necessary <https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8>; Yaa I got that but then do I not have to write a code to handle those parameters/tokens in the request/response to that Url?; Or is it done by itself?
	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.0857	for action I don't think you need to perform any authentification on your side; you can check with the verification token if the request is coming from slack but it's not mandatory
	0.0	0.724	0.276	0.6369	where is the best book about design patterns and algorithms (in python?)
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	you need to put an url in the interactive message setting and have a flask app listening on this url; and you should be good
	0.059	0.789	0.151	0.4939	<@Chantell>  To be honest, I don't find design patterns are as important in Python as they are in Java or C++. A lot of the big problems that the traditional design patterns solve don't really exist to the same degree with Python
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.2382	<@Chantell> The Python Cookbook used to be a good collection of algorithms and snippets, but I've not read the Python 3 edition
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and it has some design pattern implentations there
	0.0	0.947	0.053	0.2263	okay.. I own an older edition of the python cookbook..  I was looking at it last night.. Maybe I just need to buy the new one.; o gosh.. the older edition i have from 2013  is the newest one.  Okay
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeah.. this is mostly to advance my perspective.. not for a specific work project.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I already tried that but will try it again! Should it handle both get and post?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I already try with post; let me try it again
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	agree with <@Gabriele>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does os.abspath not work with isfile properly? I have      I get 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you using 3.6?
	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.4588	yep; I think; actually i dont know what django is using; is there a way top force it to 3.6?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you using a virtualenv?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	My venv
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	so you can do `python -V` in the command line with the venv active
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	  however; when i load the shell; its 3.5
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`python`, not `pyton`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	put a breakpoint at the `if`; and see what `resource_path` is
	0.036	0.964	0.0	-0.1027	ah strange; I see what the issue is now; That's the root dir of the project; it should be /bark_resources/resource/[serial]/file; is django interfering with this perhaps; The uploads are going to the right place; but the reading isn't; but
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you should build your path with MEDIA_ROOT
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	profile pictures work; ; is what i have
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup; so construct the rest of the file path with that; start it, actually; and then append the serial; and filename
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh so manually; I've been calling um; the file from the file field; and converting it to a string
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you print out resource_file here?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	according to the debugger; resource_abspath = {str} '/home/mmacheerpuppy/bark/bark_drive/bark/bark_project/17082017IOVCAWKXYA/17082017IOVCAWKXYA.zip' resource_file = {str} '17082017IOVCAWKXYA/17082017IOVCAWKXYA.zip'; whether i can print the object; hang on
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Anyone have any experience working with text using cairocffi?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh, so abspath goes to the project root; use `MEDIA_ROOT + / + resource_file`
	0.0	0.53	0.47	0.7901	Looks like it's going through with that; we'll see; Worked like a charm!
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.8625	Hi guys, looking for a bit of help of what best practice is.  We have multiple git repos of python packages.   There is some code that is shared between them that I want to pull of into its own project.  What is the most common way of managing dependencies between projects/repos?   This is not code that I can upload to pypy.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You can still pip install it without using pypi.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so a virtual env for each project and then pip install the other projects for them?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If they are libraries, yeah.; You can even pip install it as development, so it won't be copied to site-packages.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right now they are just packages
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.296	Yeah, probably just pip install each library as a development.; At least for people who are working on the code rather than just using it.; from pip install 
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	ah ok I didn't know that existed
	0.0	0.684	0.316	0.5719	I've only used it once, but it is nice.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4404	thanks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hello I am totally new to python, I just installed it now on my windows 8.1 system when i went to my git bash and ran "python -v" it gave off a kind of a long list of gibberish rather than the version of python
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.0772	<@Jeanett> lowercase `-v` is "verbose", capital `-V` is version
	0.289	0.462	0.249	-0.1091	help with code; `code`; i get this error
	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.607	<@Margaretta> the `set` object in python doesn't support indexing because they're unordered collections of items; as soon as you convert a list to a set you lose the ordering of any items inside; you can optionally cast back to a list and then sort again; `topdata = sorted(list(data))[0:3]`
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.6705	oh nice; passing a set to sorted directly is definitely gonna come in handy for some code golf
	0.148	0.648	0.204	0.1531	<@Latrina> what's stopping you from just creating three instances?
	0.0	0.743	0.257	0.4215	a for loop is fine if you need X instances of something to be created
	0.08	0.741	0.179	0.3818	<@Latrina> sorry, i'm not too familiar with formsets, that's a good question for <#C0LMFRMB5|django> though
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	Anyone stumbled upon something like this?
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	yes and based on the language that is chosen you get the translated field
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just makes it a lot harder to figure out what's going on without actually attaching a debugger to your code, that's all; maybe file an issue with `wagtail_modeltranslation`? search around first to see if someone else already has, though
	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.6662	yep that is true; It's been a couple of hours now ...; Why is it trying to reach the en version? I don't get it; tried: ['en/((?:[\\w\\-]+/)*)$']
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.4019	I think at this point, you need to attach a debugger and put a breakpoint on that line in wagtail_modeltranslation/patch_wagtailadmin.py; Because that's a wagtail issue, and if it's not reported, then the debugger can help
	0.037	0.86	0.102	0.4289	I have a package that I'm developing. I want to use the package inside of a virtualenv and install it with something like pip... but that's not possible unless I create a setup.py, right? Since pip only works with setup.py? Setup:  I can import the function defined in __init__.py to testcode.py by creating a virtualenv then symlinking the `mypackage` folder to my virtualenv
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	you can create setup.py and call it directly
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.4019	exactly. There is some tools that ease that. I heard some good things about Flit but never used it myself; <http://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4215	I was just thinking that it's be nice to not have to manually symlink or write the setup.py (until it's needed later for packaging purposes)
	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.2263	you can also install your package with the `-e` flags for pip; that allow you to edit the code in place without needing to reinstall each time
	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.1531	yeah, but I still need a setup.py for that?
	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.4019	`pip install -e .`; yes
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.2023	Hm, I guess I'll just manually symlink to my venv's lib/python3.5/site-packages folder until I've written a setup.py file; Since it's symlinked I can edit the code in place just fine
	0.058	0.793	0.15	0.4833	looking at it, it seems like a way to generate the setup.py and upload it to pypi. But I'm not sure how it helps if I'm not uploading it to pypi
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.8201	I suppose, but through another, new sytnax; syntax; by the way, I haven't heard much about alternatives to pypi... is there a way to create a custom repository like pypi, or do people usually just install from git repos? (Which pip support); I suppose there's little reason to create a custom pypi repo when serving things from a git repo is simple enough
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.0772	usually from git or pypi; there is also <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi> if you want your own pypi; and <https://pypi.org/> that is in the process of replacing PyPi
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.3204	what's the difference between "the" pypi and <http://pypi.org|pypi.org>?; who thought that calling them the same thing was a good idea?; I see, it's a rewrite called warehouse but the main implementation instance will also be called PyPi.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<http://pypi.python.org|pypi.python.org> is the legacy server, <http://pypi.org|pypi.org> is the new one; Naming it the same makes sense since it is the same thing, basically everything beyond the frontend and some plumbing, but the same spec

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd say when you need more of the components together than are available on their own

	0.013	0.934	0.053	0.6945	Hi all, I am having an issue with sorting nested OrderedDicts..  I  am trying to sort both the outermost dictionary, and the following dictionary by a key value in the innermost dictionary.  Given the attached snippet, this what I am trying to accomplish:  - For all foods, order the food subtypes by highest calorie content (i.e - For Pizza, Pesto should appear first because it has higher calories when compared to cheese. - Order all foods by highest calorie content (i.e - Pizza should appear first as it has a subtype with more calories than any other food); Before I tacked on the outermost dictionary, I was using this to sort just the food types (red,green,pesto,cheese):   `OrderedDict(sorted(d.iteritems(), key=lambda x: x[1].iteritems()))` .  However, I am not sure how to proceed after having tacked on the outermost dictionary.; Right, I'd like to make the structure into an OrderedDict. Can you point me in the right direction?
	0.048	0.925	0.027	-0.4939	The problem is then how to cast this as an OrderedDict?; If that is the issue, then I can think of many non-pythonic approaches.; why don't you try sorting the 2 groups separately, casting them into OrderedDict type as above. I ran your code and you are sorting operation is just making it alphabetical, ignoring the inner loops; sort Pizza, sort Apple, find Max of the two, append in order.; if you do the following `for item in d.iteritems(): print(type(item))` you will get `&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;`. You then have to unpack it accordingly making note of where your value pops out.; now, if there is a less convoluted way to do this, I am all for it.; the downside to this is that your sorting has to be via if/then type args inside each top level tuple. If there are more than two food subgroups, then you might call sort in the inner loop
	0.12	0.533	0.347	0.6249	I appreciate your help. I will see if I can play with the problem a bit more given your suggestions..

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what are your server specs (ram, cpu)? How often are images sent to tensorflow?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	4GB Ram, 2 cores 1.8GHz. Right now, I'm sending the images myself through postman so it is not something specific, but I tried sending one image, wait until I get a result, I give it 5 extra seconds, and then send another image; The first 5 times it gives a result in one or two seconds, then it starts slowing down
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is there a python module to profile that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its a code smell; only import modules in a function if you really need it locally and it costs alot to import
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I mean a module to profile the allocated memory
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html>
	0.214	0.556	0.23	0.0516	I'll run it and hope to find the problem
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you know if tf.session is actually releasing your mem?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.6597	that’s a good question; beautifulsoup has a bug, that with a context manager like that, it still doesn’t release memory if used in a loop 1000-1500 items long
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.2023	I assumed it does, since it's the recommended way according to tensorflow documentation. I'll try closing it manually
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i would check github and see if this is an issue
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	eg, bottle/flask dev server; ok, so are you using a dev server for this or guicorn/wsgi?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm using bottle
	0.086	0.862	0.051	-0.3071	yes; but the dev server, eg command line start utility, or nginx/apache with gunicorn/wsgi?; becuase if this is on your local machine with zero prduction configuration, its either your machine or a memory leak
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Dev server I think, I'm running it from command line
	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.7783	alright; what happens when you wait one minute in between; and run `top` to see what your system’s free memory looks like during that time
	0.0	0.908	0.092	0.7319	When I waited on minute after receiving a result, it was almost the same, it was eventually taking more time to get a result. Free memory sometimes decreased a lot when I sent data, and sometimes it decreased just a little, but eventually I had less free memory; I tried not using anymore the context manager, and instead I used `sess = tf.Session()` and `sess.close()` to close it, but I had the same results
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what size are the images?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	18kb
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	have you tried this not using bottle?
	0.412	0.588	0.0	-0.5994	No, do you think bottle could be the problem?
	0.037	0.881	0.082	0.4497	no, it shouldn’t; but would be interesting if you can run this code standalone with an image; take the web server out of the equation and test with just tensorflow; would give clues to which direction you should go into
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.2023	I don’t really know. I’m trying to isolate issue.
	0.04	0.96	0.0	-0.4019	I tried two things, first I called the function to categorize in a loop, and got same result, by the 5th time it was slowing down. Then I tried to call in a loop my code to categorize as if from the command line, using `os.system("python label_image.py image.jpg")` and it worked, it always took around 2 seconds. So, does that mean that it is a memory problem? Or perhaps something when I import tensorflow

	0.055	0.872	0.073	0.1531	You could do that with some regex magic.. assuming you have a reliable pattern that you can match, then transform the data to exclude the websites and format the emails however you like

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Cristy> `get_type_hints` is just a proxy for `__annotations__` with a bit of additional reverences; You're looking for `mypy` (<https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/master/mypy>) and how it can infer types
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.8555	<@Collette> - Thanks for the hints, from what I’ve read, neither `__annotations__` or `get_type_hints` provide the info I was looking for.  I can see it would be possible to walk the `__dict__`s and contextually resolve the TypeVars, but this seems like a lot of work.  Could you point me to the mypy docs that talk about resolving generic types?  I wasn’t able to find any
	0.105	0.868	0.027	-0.7115	On the `__init__` you are handling the exception by just printing it. That will cause that when there is a connection problem your script will just print the error and continue. I think that's not what you want; Don't catch exceptions for just printing; unless you are doing something with value with it. Dont do it. Let your program crash; for example in your case: you could catch the exception to try to retry the request; although i think `requests` can do that for you
	0.0	0.493	0.507	0.8834	thats a great idea tbh; and yeah thats exactly the behaviour i would like, thank you <@Mariano>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	check this: <https://www.peterbe.com/plog/best-practice-with-retries-with-requests>
	0.123	0.782	0.095	-0.4059	You are doing the same con `create_dir`. How things are right now. If the user doesn't have the permission. It will print the error and continue. Which will cause that `save_dump` will try to create a file on a dir that can't be created. Unless you have a workaround the permission problem, let it crash on `create_dir`; That's all. Everything else looks good to me. Although the class might not be needed, but that is a design choice; Well the class is ok. My bad on that

	0.154	0.846	0.0	-0.6015	That's not strictly true, but ~often~ in most cases they're interchangeable; You should use `python&lt;version&gt; -m pip` when in doubt which python will be used to invoke `pip` executable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Depending on how you installed Python and Pip, you'll usually have a `pipX.Y` binary in your `$PATH` too

	0.21	0.79	0.0	-0.1511	Whoops, sorry! Gonna delete and repost there
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.3612	Hi guys I am new around here, have a question what do you recommend continue with Python from beginner to intermediate level, or experience my next programming language on my list (Java or Javascript)?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	depends what your end goal is.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	becoming a developer, still dont know what area or direction?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	I'd advise looking into that aspect. Because it will help you decide
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	I want to go for data science or ML vs web applications
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, ML and data science is heavily python now; some java in those fields; but, languages are just tools
	0.0	0.549	0.451	0.5093	Haha, language is such a tool!
	0.0	0.627	0.373	0.8779	pick which one has the best applications to your task at hand, and balance with community participation and library support
	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.5106	If you like data science and ML then maybe stick with Python and look at playing with `scikit-learn` for a bit
	0.091	0.751	0.158	0.7374	I already started 2 data science courses, but is so hard to focus on them, cause there are so many other sources for this, duno still try to focus on something and finish it, I think is a kind of trap these days with so many free access to knowledge still I happy for this though
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	yeah, pick one, finish it, then do another one
	0.072	0.847	0.081	0.0772	one of the difficulties is figuring what to focus on; and sometimes its like reading a topic at wikipedia; you're on one particular article, with a link to something esle
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	believe me I am all over the place right now, accessing a lot of info
	0.0	0.837	0.163	0.5106	and then somehow you find yourself reading about a coast guard rescue in the 50s :=D; wikipedia rabbit hole
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.5267	guys anyone of you did some kind or pair programming or found a mentor that helped you?
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.4497	not really; there were a couple seniors that I leaned on when i was a junior; but code reviews and quality feedback are essential, I feel; as long as the critiques are fair and balanced, and you don't take them personally
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.5423	still trying to decide to go for a conversion program from business (my major) to ICT vs bootcamp vs continuing self study; of course I want to get into programming to get a job and enjoy
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.5927	I was self-taught for several years, then went to university. I think the idea of an individual mentor is a bit of a luxury, but getting feedback via forums, Slack, Stack Overflow etc, is a good alternative
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.6597	also, groups like this are invaluable; as long as you find a good one, and learn how to properly ask a question
	0.206	0.794	0.0	-0.3863	Sorry? You mean YouTube videos without captions? (Not sure if you were talking to me) <@Meg>
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.3182	Oh, I see. However might I ask what you mean by "captions"? Just curious.
	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.6124	closed captioning, subtitles; I'm deaf and wear hearing aids; so, while I can hear just about everything in my hearing range (have pretty significant high frequency loss), there's a large gulf between _hearing_ and _understanding_; so, I use lip reading alot to understand speech
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.9164	so, for me... if we were talking face to face in English, I wouldn't have any trouble conversing with you.  but if you were to rotate so your back was to me, you'd go from speaking English to Russian.. and I don't speak Russian; lip reading helps me to put values to a series of sounds of speech to understand; and autocaptions have come a long way, and the ones for conference presentations are very good
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.7579	but there's a big difference in that quality and what you see in movies, TV and live programs; and that's mainly due to quality of the audio, as well as placement of the microphone; with speech, the closer the microphone, the better.
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.9425	Oh, yes. Actually I have a lot of interest in developing accessibility-related products (primarily for their function and not so much for profit). It's good to hear that - at least for some videos - auto-captioning has gone from laughable to actually helpful. There are so many ways that technology can be used to aid those with various circumstances and conditions, and even those I _think_ it has improved somewhat, I feel like the entire field could use a lot more attention and work.
	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.3506	there actually is alot of work going on now; in fact, microsoft research has shown that their auto transcription error rate is lower than that of professional transcriptionists; <https://qz.com/812317/microsoft-msft-claims-its-speech-transcription-ai-is-now-better-than-human-professionals/>; but again, the primary differentator is quality of the audio combined with background noise
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.9589	Niiice! Well, glad to hear there are some significant advances being made then. While (as far as I know) my hearing is alright, even I would appreciate automatic, perfect transcriptions. Actually I often use subtitles with educational material even if the speaking in the video is good, as I find it helps me to fully comprehend what's being said.
	0.0	0.47	0.53	0.7845	i like subtitles for the comprehension too. i feel like i understand better.
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.6369	same here.. I acutually did a project in undergrad using dragon naturally speaking in transcribing college lectures; turned out, it worked best for online video classes, specifically my calc 2 class
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	What about YouTube? It's like quicksand
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's rought and get everywhere ?

Not only am I having trouble finding the correct table in the html, i can't figure out how to identify it in my soup code.  The documentation has been less than helpful.; I've never used a web scraper before, and I'm pretty lost
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	<@Bernita>  What does your current code look like?
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.5719	yeah, you're going to have some issues with that; take a look at the networks tab in your browser tools; for example; <http://www.fangraphs.com/extfghtml.aspx?fgtype=30>; all that information is populated dynamically; so, what you'd need is a headless browser; load the web page in the headless browser, wait for it to finish
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm trying to set it up so that I can run it every morning and refill my db then run my rankings algorithm
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sorry...headless browser?
	0.0	0.976	0.024	0.0772	run the browser without a gui; so you load the web page as it would normally; so, waht happens with that site you want to scrape is that the data is all loaded asynchronously; so, requests and beautifulsoup won't do; you need to have a browser instance running to load the content, render it as you'd expect
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.368	or check if that site has an api you can use; FYI, there's <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> channel here
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you're a g...appreciate it
	0.118	0.816	0.066	-0.6447	iinteresting, the TOS on that site doesn't say anything about not using the data; just this   &gt;ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.; usually with sites like those, there are stricter usage conditions
	0.074	0.926	0.0	-0.34	I was once in a similar situation, I used Selenium to open a webpage, dumbed its content into a file and parsed what I needed. If you use webdriver you don't even need to use a headless browser.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	actually, you do; because selenium needs something to actually render the page; typically, chromedriver, phantomdriver, etc
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You're right about that, when I said you don't need a headless browser, I meant you can just use your regular browser
	0.089	0.469	0.443	0.9273	I never used the headless chrome, but it looks like it's already capable of creating a simple dump without any other tools! That's actually pretty cool
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.8625	yep.  Originally, you had to go through quite a few steps to do it, and so phantom was usually the option of choice; but now that google's made headless chrome much easier to use in testing, usage rates are going up; which makes sense; <http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/>; take alook at the server/runtime part; PJS is PhantomJS, and its pretty incompatible with ES6
	0.141	0.859	0.0	-0.4782	Since when does it exist? I remember looking for a headless browser last year, but couldn't find anything useful except for phantomjs
	0.0	0.858	0.142	0.7684	but given that there was only one dev/maintainer, even getting to the feature level it did is a great accomplishment; <https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>; its available on linux and osx as of chrome 59, windows as of chrome 60
	0.0	0.421	0.579	0.6705	Pretty cool, have to remember that
	0.297	0.526	0.177	-0.2062	Yes. And I'm not sure why they haven't improved it yet.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there a way to package my current version of python3 and also all the packages i downloaded in my virtualenv into 1 file so then I SCP my whole project to another machine?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can do a recursive scp and move the folder with all the contents
	0.071	0.719	0.21	0.7783	<@Sharika> assuming the same architecture and system deps, you could probably just tarball up the project dir... but that's a bit odd - may be best to use Docker, install them fresh, or maybe pyinstaller

	0.08	0.92	0.0	-0.6339	I am having some problems on a server where my script doesn't seem to be releasing or reusing memory. Obviously that makes me run out of memory and hit my pagefile. It doesn't matter what script I use. I see the same results.   It is windows server 2008R2, NETSVCS seems to be what is holding onto the memory.  ; Any one have any ideas on where I can look for resources, or what I can do to find the memory leak. 
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.5994	what's the script?; I've had similar things happen when using beautiful soup in a loop
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.4019	there is some profiler available. Some should have memory support
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	even explicit garbage collection call ever 100 iterations didn't work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`memory_profiler`
	0.168	0.832	0.0	-0.6868	held by what? If the script process is dead, it wouldn't show up in any diagnostic, so how do you know it's being held?
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.4215	I can see, in resource manager, that the memory grabbed while the script was running never releases back for use. Ii know what you are saying cause that was my thought. That is why I am hoping to trace the trail to see if I can figure why a service holds to the memory after grabbed in the script
	0.251	0.749	0.0	-0.6908	so you're saying that even after you kill the process, the memory is never released?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Correct, but I can see it being consumed as a script runs (almost all of my scripts have something to do with lots of data). 
	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.3939	are you accessing a database or something ? you sure every connection are cleanly closed ?
	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.3182	I am accessing a database, I make explicit closes to the connection, before the script ends, on any script where I am using psycopg2 or pyodbc. And on a BCP command  I'm executing a batch script which is a self contained process; @malasjkovv I do a little of both depending on the needs of the original
	0.321	0.679	0.0	-0.8555	as far as I remember if you kill bat script which runs python process inside of it it will no kill Python process itself, but I may mistake
	0.127	0.873	0.0	-0.5859	sometimes it's possible to do something which triggers a memory leak elsewhere. For example, I once saw a computer with network drivers that had a memory leak. So if I downloaded a big file, 10 minutes later the computer was unusable
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.6187	The batch script is created with python but it runs BCP; <@Gabriele> interesting, my pet theory has been the network drivers haven't been releasing data, similar to what you are saying. How were you able to trace it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there any similar issue reported with the server drivers?; you're running 2008R2, correct?
	0.175	0.649	0.175	0.0	Yes 2008r2; I don't see the same problem when I run from my computer
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/using-poolmon-to-find-a-kernel-mode-memory-leak>
	0.044	0.956	0.0	-0.5499	I don't remember exactly. I think it was a mixture of coincidence and research. We saw that the computer was slow when we had a downloader program running, but a bit of experimentation showed that it didn't get fixed when we closed the program, so we figured it might be related to network activity. From there, I think we started to look specifically at the memory usage of the driver DLL, then searched to see if there was a common problem with it (and there was)

	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.4696	When I try to insert bytes data from uuid with pymysql, it returns 'data too long for column' error. How can I fix it?? The column is 16 binary.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What have you tried? A few ways that come to mind quickly, depending on your requirements:  1. Iterate the string appending all characters to a new string, if your letter is found, append a space and then the letter (naive approach) 2. `str.replace` <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.replace> 3. `re.sub` <https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.sub>
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.8343	Any recommendations on how to write understandable documentation for e.g. dicts of dicts?  Let's say we have a function that returns a dict like this:    Using Python's typing module (which we could put as a function annotation), we could write this as:        or to make things clearer:    Or perhaps something more... GraphQL-y perhaps? Something like    This would also give us a recommended variable name for each variable, which is worthwhile if we want other functions calling this functions to interact with the dict using the same name.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is a docstring on your function not enough?
	0.058	0.784	0.158	0.705	yes; but I'm wondering what's the best way to write it; that's most readable; Right now I'm using the first function annotation (with aliases), and the docstring also contains an example of actual data; *without aliases I mean; e.g. no RegistrationNumber... stuff
	0.088	0.81	0.102	0.1027	I doubt that a good docstring is not enough; you can try showing your function (or only definition) to somebody and let them guess what it does
	0.082	0.681	0.237	0.8702	Yes, but then how would you write the docstring?; as in, actual "syntax"; Describing it in words is super verbose and hard to understand; especially with dicts, I've never found a good syntax I like for describing what the key and value represents that isn't overly verbose
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	When I'm sketching out stuff on my own I usually use some type of Hindley–Milner with an Haskell-like syntax for describing these things; but then I convert it to python's typing module annotations (e.g. valid python code/syntax)
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.241	0.674	0.085	-0.5267	The problem is that there's no key: value pair datatype in python, only unordered sets of key:value pairs, so things quickly get confusing
	0.112	0.888	0.0	-0.2263	What's confusing about a dict?; Every Python programmer knows what to do with a function that outputs a dictionary.
	0.092	0.709	0.199	0.3612	Ah, sorry, true, a Car object in this case is `Car = Dict[str, str]`
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	 ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is there anyone who is familier with HappyBase for Hbase Connectivity
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	That sounds like a case for a function; `write_to_s3` and `write_to_fs`, specifically
	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.7269	well the function wouldn't actually do the writing, just generate the "file" to write to; I basically just wrapped up the s3 to act like a file object so I could write and read to it like a normal file
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah
	0.226	0.774	0.0	-0.3875	this way the script doesn't care where it is writing
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.3818	Then you just need to accept a file-like object to write into.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right kinda.  since the script is generating multiple files I can't just pass in the object
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You'll need an object per file
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I was initially thinking to just pass in the class, but started to lean more towards passing in a funciton that returns the object
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Just like you need a regular file object per file
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.6597	correct; would it be better to pass in an open_s3_file function or just pass in the s3_file class that responds to open (just like a normal file); both will work, just wondering what is considered more pythonic
	0.0	0.671	0.329	0.6597	It would be better to pass a `S3File` instance that acts like a file-like object.
	0.0	0.946	0.054	0.4939	I can't pass the instance since I don't have it yet.   The script will need to create a bunch of them; the script/function is basically reading a bunch of tables from a database, doing some transformations and then writing them out to files; the destination could be an s3 or standard filesystem; the way it is currently written it only writes to the standard filesystem, I am trying to abstract out the destination so that it can write to s3 as well
	0.0	0.632	0.368	0.3612	Yeah, pluginbase module seems to do what I want
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.2732	this particular case has to do with looking in solr(pysolr) and S3(boto)  So I need to handle possible throws of `pysolr.SolrError` as well as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gustavo> I don't think you're trying to understand what I'm trying to say. Can you look from another point of view?
	0.064	0.936	0.0	-0.2263	so, lets say you have a section of code with multiple try-catch blocks.  Which do you prefer: breaking them out to handle specific exceptions, or just have a catch-all for everything?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Anyone here familiar with Odoo?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right now, I'm doing the former
	0.017	0.904	0.079	0.8041	Hello everyone - I'm looking for direction on a work project. I'll put a sample of the information I can get below.  I work in a factory making car parts. There are two plants, about 10 departments in each plant. About 650 machines total. I would like to have something set up that I can see machine downtime by week/month/year, by department/plant/machine. I would like to see the count of breakdown occurrences, and various other information. (I'd love to explain if someone has time to talk to me about it). Anyway, i can export our reports to csv and get the information from there..But not sure what to do with it. Should I be looking into classes, or a database, etc.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are they handled the same or different? 
	0.103	0.837	0.06	-0.3905	Report number | Date | Machine Number | Downtime | Description; There are 10,000 reports for this year alone. I made a massive spreadsheet to break all of this down, but it's soooooo slow; Not sure what direction to go with this
	0.032	0.843	0.125	0.7506	If you're familiar with databases, or have someone who is familiar with them, then why not - put stuff there. You basically get aggregations for free, and aggregations are a foundation for all reports.; On the other hand, `pandas` can load CSV data and make reports on the fly as well. No need for a database if it's not a whole lot of data ( &lt;10 GB)
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.4019	differently, primarily by setting different variable values
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It'll all be text, so small... I don't have any familiarity with databases, so I'll check pandas out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	which are then later set to a django model field
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	Thank you very much
	0.16	0.84	0.0	-0.2263	that was the primary reason I split up into multiple try-except blocks
	0.0	0.82	0.18	0.296	Yeah, if anything is different I'd have the two separate handlers
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.6946	<@Blanche>, if the project is very time-sensitive, I agree with <@Suellen> ‘s suggestion, but if you’re going to be doing this sort of thing regularly, it might be good to start learning databases by building out small jobs to extract and store your data.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I learned starting with mysql using <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>, but you should also check out sqlite.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I inherited the DB from a previous dev!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mysql is to <@Suellen> as mongo is to <@Patty>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Postgres for lyfe
	0.165	0.478	0.356	0.5256	it's funny that postgres is more efficient with non-relational data than mongodb...; a cruel joke almost
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The answer to most questions which contain the word "data" in them is "postgres"; Not that I can answer the Q
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not that much I think
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	probably. i havent researched much of the difference between json/jsonb in postgres yet.
	0.039	0.77	0.19	0.8957	`jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.`; from the docs; with indexing it could make a huge difference; 100k is not very big in the db world <@Bruno>; xD
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/jsonb-type-performance-postgresql-9-4/>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	which could get big very quickly
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.5789	yea.; granted, it will be a while before i get there and can come up with a plan later on. but yea.; so, this is what the transaction data coming in would look like <https://plaid.com/docs/api/#transactions>; yea.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because pg can change a strategy for a query depending on quite a few factors
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but it will depend on JSON vs JSONB right?
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.5023	yea. but what if theres 10k records. or 100k; ah sounds like i would prefer jsonb then.
	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.4019	couldn’t `EXPLAIN` help you here ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	only post-factum, when you already have data and indexes; you should use the first one everywhere, even in tests; i.e. absolute import; what's your directory layout? are tests outside your package?
	0.195	0.805	0.0	-0.7003	<@Signe> i may use waspy. its simple enough. also, when i ran the docker container with composer, it had an error related to rabbitmq; wrong channel anyways... <#C07G5276F|async>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the tests are in a directory along side the ClassUnderTest.py
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	bleh
	0.043	0.895	0.062	-0.0129	ProjectName/ is root folder and contains an __init__.py, TextTools.py and ClassUnderTest.py, and a test/ folder with my unit tests; this is my first time creating my own modules so I maybe be doing something wrong, it's been working fine in my notebooks but ModuleNotFoundError's on ProjectName in tests
	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.418	so, generally the easiest layout is like this:; ; (forgot `__init__.py`, but you get an idea)
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	ok got it, my tests are too deep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this way you only ever use `from ProjectName.x import y`
	0.148	0.494	0.358	0.4019	thanks <@Suellen> that did the trick
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`__init__.py` goes inside of `ProjectName`, right? What is `tactisiege` in your example <@Suellen> ?
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	root project name, but yeah; `ProjectName` is a module so to speak
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	__init__.py has to be in a folder in order for the python interpreter to be able to see into that dir and load files from it as modules
	0.059	0.941	0.0	-0.0516	fwiw, I was also able to leave tests where they were (under ProjectName/) by adding .. to my env's search path
	0.622	0.378	0.0	-0.5096	that's... not great
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.6597	oh yea? I was afraid you'd say that cause I like it better :-X
	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.5743	changing system path isn't really a nice solution, only temporarily
	0.133	0.867	0.0	-0.5216	if I understand it correctly, I only changed it in my virtualenv that the unit tests run in not system level, still not the greatest?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what if you distribute this package to users?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can't really expect them to modify their paths
	0.107	0.665	0.228	0.3716	yes, understood, bummer... had a bad smell to it but saves me a project in my larger solution file
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.3182	Can someone please tell me why I am getting these results? 
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	yeah, it's a nightmare.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you're doing this? ; and not getting what i'm getting?
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.4019	In Python 3 I get a smiley; In Python 2 exactly what you get
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.6597	i'm trying to work out a bug where that smiley shows up as 4 question marks in an email. which is probably because it gets translated to those four hex values; any pointers?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	python2 only?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.3612	you need to make sure you treat text as unicode when you get it from user, for example, but as soon as you need to send it, it should be properly encoded to bytes; emails are bytes, AFAIK; 
	0.253	0.747	0.0	-0.5267	this works: ; there is no such thing as converting a string to bytes in python2.7 no?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’m kind of tempted to update conda as root?
	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.5719	<@Ashly> there is no such thing, correct, and that's why all the mess; strings are bytes and bytes are strings by default; the only sane way is convert them as soon as they cross a boundary in your system; as for "this works", here let me show you an example; ; 
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.1531	ok but encoding it in unicode won't work as `email.body` is already unicode. i get `TypeError: decoding Unicode is not supported`
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	when i fetch it from the db it shows up like that too
	0.119	0.751	0.131	0.1272	no, it's OK; ; repr shows a more readable representation; ok, then the problem happens when email is converted to a `str` (bytes), just before being sent; maybe headers aren't set, I'm not really familiar with email protocols
	0.117	0.783	0.1	-0.1027	cool, so then it's the email that's the problem then; email headers: ; email sent out as: ; using django core mail
	0.384	0.379	0.237	-0.3736	is it always broken like `????`; ?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep
	0.072	0.738	0.191	0.4118	I'm lost; not really familiar with Django either, so I don't know.. but it should handle unicode fine, being a top framework
	0.0	0.66	0.34	0.8316	<@Suellen> yeah me too. thanks for helping out though. at least now i know why it shows up like `hey \U0001f642` in the test
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hello guys; I got a question about using the requests python module
	0.0	0.548	0.452	0.872	<@Hyman> best to just ask the question, someone will likely be along to help :)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If I send a POST request using this module let us say en encoded form for a login, when the server will answer, where are we going to have the response
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	where?
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.8625	it depends on where you make the request. in postman it will show the response. if in the terminal, it will spit out the response when done (httpie is great for this). in a python script, there should be some response object you can get the results from. how you access that will depend on what library you are using to make the request. In order for people know better answer, it helps to have a sample of what you are doing. <@Hyman>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Hyman> on the response object. It will be as `.json()` if the response is a Json one, otherwise I think `.data()` both are covered in the docs ; <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-content>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	author_name?
	0.163	0.732	0.105	-0.6603	why is it printing out the unicode character successfully in my development console fine, but shows up as some other encoding in my test assertion and in my pdb console?; well there are two problems no? it should not show up like `u'hey \U0001f642'` in my test assertion right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Dell> can you show us the code?
	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.4464	technically no but I kind of boiled it down to the essence here; so where this json is loading and setting it, that works - but when _run_ is called those assignments don't exist; it just goes back to None; ahhh yeah that's much more straightforward
	0.344	0.333	0.322	-0.0516	that's better; _deletes wrong one_
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Finally I understand how the taco bot works...
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	<@Lenny> help
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> but how will you see a new taco-related GIF?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Anyone knows how to `pip install` large C-based packages *in parallel* such as cython, pandas, scipy?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Multiple terminals?; Not that I;ve ever tried
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	numpy provides `NPY_NUM_BUILD_JOBS` environment variable but could not find similar things in others
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why? does it really take so long you can't wait?
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.6486	because i'm installing them on Alpine linux,; pypa's shiny "manylinux" wheels does not work; so it builds everything from ground up; I saw there are discussions on adding "musllinux" tag but it seems to be taking some time to get agreement
	0.495	0.505	0.0	-0.5994	<@Suellen> unfortunately gifs still ignore that setting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I tried `MAKEFLAGS` `MAKEOPTS` environment variables but pip seems to just call the C compiler directly without using Makefile
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.1901	I'll like to use robobrowser to sumit a form but I don't know where the response goess about
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4215	<@Assunta> rubocop is for ruby, you’ll want the python equivalent which will be something like flake8; or maybe someone has something for recent to suggest, it’s been a while since I’ve set up a python project
	0.0	0.687	0.313	0.9042	ah I can use flake8. I will look on it <@Junita>; thanks; yes please. I need help on how to ensure to align my team in python development; because I am preparing all the process materials we need
	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.2869	<@Junita> isn't the flavor of the month pylint? Is there any significant difference between flake8 and pylint?
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.2617	<@Suellen> yeah, i already know -- i'm asking how to build c-based packages faster; (even not on alpine linux); i can bear with that i need to build things from ground up, but i want to make the build processes fast
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wheel are not available ?
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.3818	not on alpine; make a docker image; accept the slow build time; deploy to docker hub
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how about unit testing any idea?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so it’s been a while since I’ve looked into this stuff.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and use that image
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm. could you built your own wheel and upload on your own devpi or something ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm
	0.521	0.479	0.0	-0.6642	but not sure that easier to do
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i'm already using multi-staged builds to make it fast
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Assunta> standard library unittest module or pytest
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.25	then, another way of question: how to determine all the file list that is created by the build process of a wheel?
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.296	yeah I think pytest is the common thing these days.  there again I’m out of date, using nose still
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah pytest is the common one
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.7003	thanks <@Ciera>; I will look on it. since I am not aware in python. I used in Ruby Rspec and TDD. using codeship; but will look fully on it; thanks guys for the details.
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	i'm already doing like this: 
	0.151	0.849	0.0	-0.2411	pytest might have somehting for TDD (but not sure I don't use it)
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.6249	maybe if i can do the same for cython/scipy/pandas/..., it will be great
	0.076	0.874	0.05	-0.2127	<@Ciera> ok, but is there anyway to have a continuous development that includes unit testing? I found this book: <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html> using django; but I am not sure If I am on the right track
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that depend on your CI
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	yeah that’s more of a process question than a tools question
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.1531	heh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, would it be sufficient to zip &amp; copy the package directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy`), with some tweaks on pkg-info files
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.34	<@Leigh> <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/7af5d3e92a59906927a566e5dc4a99eeaca49b96/.travis.yml> It seems that CFLAGS can be passed easily for Cython build; But I couldn't find anything standard
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	CFLAGS are for individual c compiler invocations
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	yes, of course; I wonder if it's possible to pass MAKEOPTS this way
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	setuptools seems not to use makefile at all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	there's a `--global-option` and `--install-option` for pip, but these options are passed to `setup.py` and it must deal with those -- again not standard
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hm; i think i should go for separate image builds (either using multi-staged or different images) to build wheels for alpine linux

	0.049	0.888	0.063	0.1184	Hey guys. A quick git question from a beginner.  I cloned my bitbucket repo to my 2nd machine, did some changes that I wasn't happy with. Now I wanna discard those changes and clone the master branch and work on that.  Can I just remove the whole project folder on my 2nd machine (django project, venv and git repo and all) and just clone the master repo, set up a new venv and start again? Or is it some other recommended way of doing it?; (Oh yeah, I didn't push the changes, although they are committed to my local repo on my 2nd machine)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`git reset --hard origin/master` is one way

	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.296	basically i want for example to query ES data index via Python/Jupyter. Is elasticsearch-py worth trying?

If, however, I change the Grid __init__ to use RVSingle for self.devices_list I get an exception, ScrollView accept only one widget.  Is there a better way to have one of the RecycleViews be multiselect and the other single select?   ; Actually, I got it working. The inheritance between RVSingle and RV caused the issue, I changed RVSingle to inherit from RecycleView instead.
	0.0	0.78	0.22	0.9285	Hi All, new to python, have pulled the following out of a dict, wanting to extract the Resource value.  Thought it was a list but echo'ing list[0] echo's the full line and list[1] is 'out of range':; any ideas on the best way to do this would be greatly appreciated!

	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.938	What would you guys say is the best way to distribute your Python code to other Windows machines (that don't have Python installed)? I just used `pyinstaller` and that worked great but the output was a little sloppy (a bunch of files, the .exe hidden in the dist folder). It's not bad but I'm wondering if there's a cleaner option for the end user? Thanks!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`pyinstaller --onefile`; or is it `--one-file`...; anyways, it will be one single executable
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	<@Dominick> how'd you invoke it? You can do `--onefile` and just share the one .exe
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Suellen> <@Beula> Ahhhh didn't know about that - I should probably read the documentation first...thanks guys

The error is `Failed to find application: myapp.app` but I can see app file in the myapp dir and it was working until recently; Oh I am also using docker so the issue isn't coming from something I have installed
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Vita> what's your commandline; i.e. how do you launch gunicorn
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and you totally have `myapp/app.py` with `def create_app()` inside?
	0.121	0.822	0.057	-0.4199	yep! It was working last time I tried, but I finally fixed other errors and now it won't work (this has been going on for about a month)
	0.073	0.795	0.132	0.2023	btw, I suggest a different approach, because strangely this method doesn't work for me; what I did was: 1. created `wsgi.py` in project root; ; and then `gunicorn wsgi:app` works alright
	0.0	0.164	0.836	0.6249	<@Suellen> ok thanks
	0.0	0.91	0.09	0.5514	did you find the culprit?; other pages are accessible?; `create_app()` should take care of all that; your app should also work the same when using Flask debug server, or gunicorn, or any combination; otherwise something isn't right
	0.0	0.837	0.163	0.3182	Does it matter whether I `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;` before or after creating the rest of the tables in my database?
	0.098	0.902	0.0	-0.1877	if you haven't created an extension, how would you use types from it in your table columns?
	0.0	0.774	0.226	0.8299	<@Suellen> uhhh.....magic, of course.; `return User_Report.query.filter(func.ST_DWithin(geom::geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(lon, lat), 4326)::geography, 50000))` Why does this keep giving me a syntax error?; Looks perfectly fine to me; Oh wait, is `::geography` an SQL and not a Python thing?
	0.312	0.688	0.0	-0.2057	`func.cast(...)`; I'm not 100% certain
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You need to work with sql and not python for that 
	0.377	0.623	0.0	-0.2057	doesn't GeoAlchemy provide helpers?
	0.0	0.908	0.092	0.5023	I'm on mobile so don't have the links handy, but postgis has exactly the same queries you're looking for; If it's anything like geodjango, it implements some but not the entire feature set
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.2481	Sweet!; There's certainly a learning curve to figure what's been implemented in the orm and what hasn't.; For example, geodjango doesn't have any clustering built into it, but you can do it with postgis once you install the nearest neighbor extension 
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.2144	Definitely. I figured out how to do what I wanted to do using SQL in the command line but didn't realize it'd be a bit different in Python.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It will be; Because geoalchemy has its own interface to use; So you'll have to translate from a working sql call to how geoalchemy does it

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	here is screenshot from debug session:
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If you expect zero in this case, you need to use "integer division". Example: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can someone explain how this is possible
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`%` is not `/`; `%` is the modulo

	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.4215	Hi, I am have been working with MSBI and SQL.. I want to learn python , Can anyone recommend me sites/books
	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.8402	If you have a pluralsight subscription, the Python series by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham is one of the best I’ve seen.  Worth a month’s fee actually just to consume those three; Other than that, the Exercism python track is good for reinforcing what you’ve learned <http://www.exercism.io/languages/python/about>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It allows reuse of an address/port before waiting for the socket `TIME_WAIT`
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yeah, I saw loads of ports going to `TIME_WAIT`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it means you open multiple time the same socket
	0.281	0.719	0.0	-0.6908	It should, alternatively you can kill and restart whatever is using that port
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have multiple python projects using the same db
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you closing the mongo client on shutdown of your app, <@Shelly> ?
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	well it appears to be keeping a connection open on that socket
	0.0	0.561	0.439	0.5719	Yeah, looks like it, any suggestions on workarounds?
	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.0772	dont use mongo; but in all seriousness
	0.11	0.846	0.044	-0.5267	(couldnt resist, i abhor mongo); i’d look into reducing the `TIME_WAIT` on sockets in windows (not sure where that would be); I’d also take a look at what processes have that port open when the error occurs; the latter will show you if something is holding that connection open
	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.481	Which process shows this error? I usually only see it when opening a listening socket, and I'd think you don't need to do that often
	0.098	0.902	0.0	-0.3612	It could also be TCP/IP port exhaustion on Windows: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx>; since it’s Windows and Mongo though I’ve about hit the limit of my knowledge
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	I need to check this out, thanks
	0.25	0.459	0.291	0.2023	No problem, and like <@Gabriele> said, the `netstat` command is your friend here
	0.105	0.594	0.301	0.6486	<@Treva> we like these learning resources: <https://github.com/pyslackers/learning-resources/blob/master/topics/essentials.md>; i’ve heard great things about automate the boring things.

	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.7073	hey, I wrote my first multi-processing worker today after reading up this great tutorial : <http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/|chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/>. However, it runs infinitely for some reason.; ; How should I got about debugging this?
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	<@Tameika> can you share the code that you are running?
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.296	actually print statements will work; I know it's a stupid way, but it takes literally 10 seconds; First verify that your function works standalone, without multiprocessing.
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.2732	well is `worker` a function?
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.6597	yes, that's the first step indeed; yes <@Patty> it is a function
	0.088	0.497	0.414	0.7096	well without further context this is a bit tricky. sharing your code helps a lot
	0.164	0.702	0.135	-0.128	sure,  i will follow <@Suellen>'s advice, if it fails -- i will get back to you

	0.022	0.951	0.027	0.1154	Trying to figure out kivy, and it is fun.  I'm using a RecycleView, following the instructions found here: <https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.recycleview.html>  Unfortunately, I don't see a way to get selected items. Rather, I can get a all items, but nothing that says they are selected. There is the callback for when an item is selected, and I could populate my own dictionary as they are selected, but it would be preferable to access a property that returns just the selected. Anyone know how to do this?
	0.0	0.292	0.708	0.8658	hahaha; It's pretty thanks to Mike's fiverr
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I wis I had the time to take a deeper look at kivy
	0.099	0.717	0.184	0.3612	It's interesting. Lots and lots of objects. But, I got tired of trying to figure out tkinter's issues, so thought Kivy would be more interesting.
	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.4576	Kivy seems really interesting for rpi based displays and stuff
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.6369	I did wxpython - it was the best one I could find to do menubar style widgets
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I do almost all of my programming for cli, but for this program I think a gui is appropriate for my user base. It would be a rather complex cli interface if I were to try it there.;   This is the example they give, and I could use that to build a dictionary of what is selected. Given that what is selected is on the screen at all times though, I would expect that would be an option from the start. I don't see anything relevant in dir(object) though.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it seems to be triggered by an event
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Right.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so I guess everytime you select or unselect something this function got triggered; or maybe you need to bind it somehow to a specific check box
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Exactly. 
	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.0772	myabe there is something to get all checkbox and then you can just find the one you want in those ? selected or not
	0.0	0.662	0.338	0.8479	One nice thing though, that box in the bottom right formats using restructured text. So, pretty formatting that should be easy.
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	Hey guys I want to contribute to open source. Can anyone point me right direction to start
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.34	<#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects>, we have 2 projects that are open source with lots of issues of all sorts of difficulty.
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.6908	How much python do you know? A lot of projects always want help with:  1. Documentation 2. Testing 3. Features  We have a few, as <@Johana> mentioned, otherwise there is always any library you like/use that can probably use help
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is anybody here familiar with lowess/loess surface fitting?
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.466	In this example, should the function always be like `_()`? Can it return a named function instead? If so, how would I do that?    
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.5305	<@Bonita> - did you try it? You can name the function (but really it gets re-assigned when you do `foo = raise_to_input(x)`); What are you really wanting to accomplish?
	0.063	0.845	0.092	0.5023	<@Beula> I did attempt it, but received an error. If the work (assignment) gets done in that step, than it’s necessary to leave it in. I was just looking for a way to remove that step. I don’t have a direct application for it at the moment. I’m just learning the concept. Thanks for the help.; <@Beula> Like, maybe, adding the name of the returned (newly minted) function as an input parameter, for instance.
	0.0	0.506	0.494	0.4404	oh, you want a dynamic "name" `func.__name__`?; 
	0.132	0.868	0.0	-0.4396	<@Beula> I think so, but am unclear on the terminology. I’m experimenting with it to try to figure-out how that works.
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.3182	To answer the original question, you can return any function object:    If that is what you are going for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula>  It raises a NameError over `baz`. While,  provides `value: 12`. Am I understanding correctly that it’s not possible to remove the assignment step `baz = foo()`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Correct due to scoping rules; baz is defined in a nested scope that's not visible to you after it's returned 
	0.0	0.294	0.706	0.8625	<@Beula> Great. Thanks. That makes it clear.
	0.05	0.914	0.036	-0.3145	Hi guys is there anyone around that can help me out?; I'm working on a technical test I was given.  I completed the test, and my code works. I've been asked however to make it installable via pip. I'm abit confused as to the process. I created a setup.py, I've uploaded it to pypi (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boggle2/0.1>) and you can install it using pip ; but as ive never done this before, I'm not sure what is the end goal here?  Is it that once you  you won't need to download the code from my github repo?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	exactly; then you can `import boggle2` in your python repl or script
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.296	ok and once you run import boggle2 you can run my code?
	0.092	0.708	0.2	0.3994	ok, so I created a virtualenv to test it out. I did the   ran python but it can't find boggle2; Thanks for your help, my mind is a bit pickled with this.; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you do a `pip freeze`
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.232	0.768	0.0	-0.2755	not in python. like you did pip install
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.296	and can you share your `setup.py` maybe you installed it with a different name
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	hmm. I think you are missing something
	0.0	0.708	0.292	0.3182	Ok; Does the file structure when I uploaded to pypi matter?
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	you need something like `    packages=find_packages()` in your setup.py
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	0.893	0.107	0.2023	and `from setuptools import find_packages` at the top; otherwise it doesn't know what packages it bundle
	0.0	0.57	0.43	0.6983	ok so ; something like that?; and the import statement at the top
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`find_packages()` should be enough; it should autofind your package
	0.132	0.684	0.184	0.0534	ok, so ill upload again, and then when I create a virtualenv and pip install, I should be able to import boggle2
	0.102	0.837	0.061	-0.2484	but you might need to have your script in a directory; `boogle2/boogle2.py`; not sure if it's mandatory or not; maybe someone else knows
	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	No i can't see all the channels 
	0.0	0.609	0.391	0.8395	I think I've got it working <@Ciera>  Thanks so much for all your help, you really saved me!
	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.296	ok so last question (I think)...; a user runs   They then need to go to the directory where pip installed it to be able to import it and run it?
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.4738	<@Ciera> thank you !! I am new to Slack 
	0.095	0.905	0.0	-0.296	I ask because that's what I expected, yet I can't get it to work unless I go to that directory; I must be missing something again &gt;.&lt;
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you mean exactly by "can't get it to work"? What are you trying, and what happens when you do?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.046	0.883	0.071	0.128	Okay, so it does install properly. It's suggesting there a problem in your module. Are you sure that is your module, and you don't have some other `boggle` installed?; Another thing to check is whether you have a `boggle` file in the newboggle directory, which could be taking precedence over the one installed via the `boggle_checker` package
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.4215	It would be nice to figure it out though
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	; Yeah
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.5267	Okay. I think the issue is perhaps that you have a boggle module inside the boggle package; You might need to use it like `from boggle import boggle` or similar
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.4767	That works; cheers; How would I get it to run and show the results of the tests?
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	Hi, What is the name off the community projects channel?; Ahah thank u <@Ciera>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup did it!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Anastacia>  by default, pip installs the package in a way that makes it available to all Python programs, except those that run in a virtual environment. For those, you need to install it in the virtual environment directly.
	0.0	0.768	0.232	0.7407	Ok let me check those things; ; Ha.  The guy has just emailed me to say he ran the code so not to worry about packaging it up
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Did you check for a boggle file in the directory you were running from?; Or, try running in some other location?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.84	0.16	0.2732	you can create a function call run in test_boggle that runs the tests
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it Python 2 or 3 ? as your Line#71 is Py2.x style while the rest are Py3.x style
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.296	Python 3; yeah i guess i forgot () around print statement, changed it now; still nothing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the code looks correct to me
	0.059	0.855	0.086	0.2263	I'd use a debugger and step through to find where it gets stuck (pdb or whatever is built into your editor/ide); That's better than any of us guessing what is going on
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or if you don't have a remote debugger connection set up, use print statements or log to a file on the raspi
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where did you put the pdb statement?
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	well what does that is wiating for ?  `pygame.event.get()`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^^ this. are you triggering any events that would go to the pygame queue?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mendy> <#C0LMFRMB5|django> would be more apt
	0.0	0.385	0.615	0.4926	<@Ciera> Whoops! Thanks
	0.205	0.513	0.282	0.1531	yeah, heh. I always overcomplicate simple stuff
	0.0	0.721	0.279	0.8356	<@Shirl> can you confirm that keypress events are being received in your code?; <@Sean> that's pretty easy to do!; thats where communities like this are handy
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Sean> one thing to look at - you can pass signed urls to the client and have them upload the images directly to s3 so they don’t have to go through your server
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	well, you need some way to have auth, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you would still need a flask + postgres behind
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for the admin to upload - yes.; <@Ciera> exactly; where do I keep that then? also in AWS?
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2732	well, you *can* do auth using lambda and their cognito service
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.25	one downside with direct to s3 upload is you're relying on the client for the upload, and bypassing restrictions can be done
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	might be easier to start thought just doing a simple flask app
	0.069	0.931	0.0	-0.1779	if you do it server side, that's trickier to work around, and you'll be able to store metrics and other info about the uploads/images
	0.139	0.749	0.112	-0.128	<@Meg> when you create the signed url you can restrict it to that specific file upload
	0.132	0.868	0.0	-0.3491	<@Meg> uhm not really, i’m trying to use debugger but not sure how to do that either
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	<@Shirl>, are you using something like pycharm to write your code?
	0.145	0.855	0.0	-0.296	no i’m actually writing it in atom and testing it on Rpi through ssh
	0.068	0.825	0.107	0.2006	ok, that makes things a little trickier; you should look at how to set up a remote python debugger with atom
	0.437	0.563	0.0	-0.5659	<https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger>; unfortunately, that one doesn't support remote debugging
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.5719	but if it’ll make a lot easier for me to debug with pycharm, i can try to get that instead
	0.035	0.843	0.122	0.4205	and doesn't seem like other packages will allow you to do so; there's a community version that's free, and should fit your needs here; but its a more full-featured environment than atom, with a learning curve.; not to dissuade you, but as a heads up
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	isn't the remote debugger only in the paid version ?
	0.395	0.605	0.0	-0.2411	not sure, lemme check
	0.07	0.93	0.0	-0.0516	I think sshing to the rpi and using logging/print could do the trick; or use the rpi ide
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	+1, or run with `pdb` via ssh
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah, rpi is headless right now
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then when you run the script it will pause
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	ok i’ll try that <@Beula>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think `?` will show the commands, but basically you can then "step" through with `s` and it will go line by line as you hit `s&lt;enter&gt;`
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how are you importing pdb in that function?
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Seems like maybe it was executed at interpreter startup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do it inside the function
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.368	it needs to be inside the function; FYI, you can use code formatting in slack; <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>; makes things a little more readable when differentiating code from regular text
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; the out put i’m getting is; 
	0.093	0.907	0.0	-0.1655	Maybe just use `print` statements for now, that's odd but am about to run out the door
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	looks like it's waiting for some kind of event happening on the rpi
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah it should monitor keyboard keys
	0.131	0.768	0.101	-0.1627	Well it seems it doesn't get the event; never used pygame so can't really help you on that
	0.286	0.714	0.0	-0.4215	I’m struggling to get the url inside a list.

	0.12	0.8	0.08	-0.2263	<@Suellen> : i think the problem is this line :  ` new_rows = delegate(someLib.process(req), req.image_path, image_url)`; when I comment that line, the whole program runs fine
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, relevant code is probably there
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.4215	true, i think it has got do with the fact that the `someLib.process(req)` is being called by multiple workers
	0.211	0.789	0.0	-0.5862	what is that library?; hm.. even if it's not thread-safe, does that mean it's not multiprocess-safe?; I'm honestly not sure
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.5859	it is a library which I created myself to wrap C++ code. Didnt take it account thread safety
	0.038	0.765	0.198	0.8772	in theory it should be ok, since a whole process is launched for the task; a debugger of some kind is your best bet, guessing will only take you so far; One guess left: &gt; req = someLib.Request(); This is a shared resource that's used between processes; that's not very good; can you refactor it so that each worker gets its own copy?
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.3182	sure will do; it still waits; essentially it prints all the 'before' statements and hangs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	inside `delegate` too?; up until you call a C function?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	delegate does not call the C function , it is `someLib.process(req)` which does; i even decoupled that line into 2 lines : ```c_resp = someLib.process(req)
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.4576	you most definitely need a real debugger then
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	` new_rows = delegate(c_resp, req.image_path, image_url)```
	0.026	0.93	0.043	0.2512	in pycharm when querying a database using an sql console, is it possible to mimic the output format of `\G` ?; it doesnt seem to like that. but when i have one record with a ton of columns, make it harder to read.; ah on the top right theres a "Transpose" button. any ways to get that from the actual query?
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.7178	hmm. more efficient way to write this if theres a million `accounts` and you just need to return the first:  while keeping it in a generator. easy if just using a loop
	0.318	0.682	0.0	-0.4215	<@Antionette> hmm, ill have to try that.
	0.101	0.759	0.139	0.1531	no but if it doesnt exist it will throw an exception.; which is fine.
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.5256	What is the most effective way to perform `Open Image in new tab` and grab the url of that image in python?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you know what to open in a new tab, don't you know an URL already?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I tried referring to this SO link : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40110394/how-to-get-absolute-path-for-image-on-a-website>; but it does seem to retrieve all images
	0.0	0.592	0.408	0.4833	don't forget about iter!; doesn't exhaust the generator!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so need try/catch
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next>
	0.0	0.813	0.187	0.3182	hmm, interesting.; the original shouldnt and just not return any results.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Antionette> ooh. youre right.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Deedee> trying to understand unpacking?
	0.0	0.361	0.639	0.6486	cool. glad you got it.
	0.123	0.787	0.091	-0.1635	Hi All!; am I allowed to ask for coding help here?; Stupid q but I nearly got kicked off another platform
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.4688	<@Carlene> yup! <#C07EFMZ1N|help> is for more general python questions and then we've got various channels for more specific stuff like <#C0LMFRMB5|django> <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>, etc.
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.6369	I believe it's best to `.gitignore` the `.pyc` files
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4215	i did but they were added to the log before I added *.pyc to gitignore actually just did a commit without adding the files and it worked
	0.0	0.759	0.241	0.3612	you might also want to do a commit that delete the one on master
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.6705	I have a list `seq`. I want to split this list up into sublists by grouping them around a function. Any idea what this might be called? Best explained with an example probably: `f(seq=range(8), grouping_function=lambda x: x % 3) == [[0,3,6]. [1,4,7], [2,5]]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	groupby?
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	oh... of course. I kept looking at things called partition. thanks.
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.6476	you might want to look at `more-itertools` or `boltons` library; lots of short helper functions there; <https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons/blob/master/boltons/iterutils.py#L470>; ; just look at the example!; cool
	0.0	0.904	0.096	0.6124	hello guys; i have a question; i have a user data with 20 different parameters and i have some "results" with predefined conditions; like "((a=5 or b=3) and user.is_active) or user.is_admin"; i can run eval(condition) for each result on each data but there are plenty of result items now, like 2000, it takes too long
	0.063	0.634	0.303	0.802	Perhaps there's a nicer way to solve my problem though: I want to grab the first value in each group created by splitting a sequence up using some function. Right now I'm thinking of doing something like 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	any advices to make it faster and more clean-logical-pythonic?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> `next(groupby(...))`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Denna> those predifined conditions are string ?
	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.2748	<@Denna> I think that depends largely on the semantics of those conditions. `eval` is almost certainly not the answer though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> they are coming from users of the system; not from a programmer
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How are users able to formulate these conditions when they obviously refer to code details (like the existence of an 'is_admin' property)
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	Perhaps this explains it better:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If you can simplify the conditions in some way - e.g. to make them all into conjunctions (everything must be true) - then you can make it more data-driven
	0.031	0.873	0.096	0.3158	hm, in this case we're sorting `seq` first so we're not getting the first value of `seq` as much as "exactly one value from seq", but it doesn't matter for me at the moment
	0.199	0.801	0.0	-0.305	I'm really not sure how to change it right now
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hello everyone, i have a question about class initialization  so i have a class that i am importing into a main .py file. Lets call it imp_mod.  i have the init defined so that when i call imp_mod.ClassName() it runs the init. but it also seems to be running the rest of the methods inside of the class. Why would it be doing that?
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	so you have something like   ; and you’re calling it via `imp_mode.ImpMod()`?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you have defined in the `__init__`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You don't seem _sure_ though. Have you tried putting a print statement in that search function to confirm, one way or the other?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i just did as a sanity check, and my print statement inside search does appear; might it be because in the main function i am assigning it to a variable?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	would you mind adding the entire `ImpBot class`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You'll have to show the code
	0.0	0.465	0.535	0.3182	bot = imp_mod.ImpBot(); sure
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does it also happen when you do  
	0.267	0.476	0.257	-0.0258	ill see; yes it still does it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what is `search_terms`; and where are you declaring it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	search terms is an array of strings that lives outside of the class but in the same file
	0.207	0.793	0.0	-0.481	Most likely it's the stuff outside the class that is causing this problem
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	perhaps something is making an instance and calling .search()?
	0.154	0.846	0.0	-0.4767	perhaps it's set up wrong. sometimes people put in the `()` in the UI code when they shouldn't
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	exactly
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	when it should just be .search; ohhhhhh; WORKS; thank you, i didnt know that that would make a difference
	0.0	0.26	0.74	0.6908	glad we could help
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> <@Meg> :+1:; so that is a general python rule then? that if it has the () at the end it will run it regardless?
	0.103	0.897	0.0	-0.4329	depends, really; is it being passed as an argument to a method that is expecting a function or method?; or is it to be executed at that point?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the `()` means 'call this function immediately'; so you're assigning the result of that function call to `command`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ahhhh
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.1513	when you really want to assign the _function itself_ to `command`
	0.112	0.888	0.0	-0.4868	right, makes sense to me; it shouldnt be called instantly, since it is a button and should only be called when pressed; so no (); got it!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	however, there are places where you do need the function to be called right away; for example, django url definitions with class based views; you have to use the `.as_view()` call when mapping a view class to a URL, or it won’t work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	functionception

	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4019	<@Margareta>, verify that `created_time` is generating some values that are &gt; 10 days ago.; w.r.t `current`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Margareta>, it also could be that you’re passing `path` into `os.path.isfile` instead of `full_path`.

	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.6868	Hey guys.  I screwed up some stuff when hacking and slashing some name changes of classes and file names.  How can I go back to my last commit/push ?; I haven't added anything or commited since last night and I wanna to back to that point.; Delete everything and clone the repo?

	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	sanic is a microframework, and as such it's easier to work with
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we use it for all our API. Without any ORM pure sql
	0.172	0.705	0.123	-0.2794	OK, and just a very basic async question: what happens if I try to use a blocking ORM like Sqlalchemy ORM in an async app? As normal db requests are so fast, would it be a problem that it blocks?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wait, what parts of ORM are inherently blocking?; I thought ORM was an abstraction over Core which by itself does nothing; Or it's just too complex to sort out at once?
	0.688	0.312	0.0	-0.296	no idea
	0.091	0.836	0.073	-0.128	Well, if you call a function that returns some objects, that function doesn't return until the objects are available, so that counts as blocking in some sense
	0.0	0.385	0.615	0.7506	true that, even Core is fantastic
	0.113	0.714	0.172	0.34	I think Core is now async and only ORM is the problem. Also there is a great article by Mike: <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>
	0.173	0.673	0.154	-0.2023	<@Suellen> yes, it's a bit strange that he says that. But he also recommends gevent to solve the same problems, and some long time Python users told me that using gevent is insane in production.
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.7003	It's pretty clear from the Core docs that it's not intrinsically an async API
	0.0	0.658	0.342	0.5683	gevent isn't really insane, it has a looong history and is stable

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> do you use it for a full webserver or only for slower endpoints? Are you using it with an ORM?
	0.053	0.825	0.122	0.3291	Well it's best to use a non blocking one obviously. There is some work on making sqlalchemy work with asyncio; for example this <https://github.com/CanopyTax/asyncpgsa> by <@Signe> but it's only for sqlalchemy core

	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.6908	what do you mean?; you can't set a transparent pixel on an image that doesn't have a transparency (alpha) channel; you need to convert from RBG to ARBG before you put a tranparent pixel there; and obviously when you save, you should use a format that supports alpha channels. For example png.

	0.089	0.745	0.167	0.296	AFAIK, yes, the result of the authorization comes to me as a HTTP request to the callback URL.; There's a chance I misunderstand how OAuth 1.0 works.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I only ask because, for example, you can auth on Reddit using OAuth without a redirect or a callback
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is it OAuth 1.0 or 2.0?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	2.0
	0.061	0.772	0.166	0.6494	That might be one of the differences.; Or more likely, I'm completely misunderstanding how this works.; <@Suellen> Thanks for the link. Keeping everything in python and in the same codebase will definitely make this easier to manage. I'll look into that library further.

	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.4696	can anybody help me with Interpretabiliy models in Deep Learning??
	0.101	0.788	0.111	0.0679	<@Galen> post in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, they are much more likely to help; <@Augusta> also we have a <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> channel where you can post your problem
	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.1531	does anybody use PyCharm? When I switch tabs, I want   Run/Debug in the upper right corner to change automatically. Now I have to manually select the file which I want to Run/Debug everytime I switch a tab.
	0.052	0.927	0.021	-0.4854	it won’t; pycharm usually has the last run execution as the top option in the dropdown; but you can right click in the file after changing the tab and select Run or Debug; if that’s something that you would find handy to have, you can submit a feature request at <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY>; but a major problem for that is most run configurations are project based, not file based
	0.085	0.636	0.28	0.7299	yes, but don't you agree that it is silly for PyCharm, which is one of the best Python IDE's, to not have that option?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	¯\_(ツ)_/¯; make a feature request
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right click -&gt; run; and then the list will be re-ordered
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	yeah, I know, I'am using that option...I will submit a request
	0.181	0.819	0.0	-0.4754	for me, it would be an absolutely useless feature; because I’m project-based, not file based
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why is that?
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.5574	so, if I keep changing files and tabs in a project, I don’t want to run the current file; I want to run the entire project; so if I have a django or flask project going on, and I edit the models file.  I don’t want the run configuration to automatically switch to running that file, vs the project run configuration I already have active
	0.284	0.716	0.0	-0.5209	ohh...I am a absolute beginner, so I find that lack of option strange and unintuitive
	0.082	0.84	0.078	-0.0772	ah, ok.  for you, it might make more sense to have that kind of option.  But I would suspect that for the vast majority of pycharm users, that would result in unintended side effects like how I described above; also, consider the fact that each file might have different interpreter and run arguments; so that would require you to create a run configuration for each file; if you switch over to a file that has no configuration set up, how would it behave?
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.168	different interpreter? Why would someone want to change the interpreter?
	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.3612	one file runs on 3.5; other runs on 3.6.2; or you need to pass in a different argument to the interpreter
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	backward compatible?
	0.024	0.976	0.0	-0.4329	so, what pycharm lets you do is define interpreter configurations, where you can define interpeter executable paths or virtualenvs; and then apply in run config; so, for one project, if you need it to be backwards compatible, you can have a run config pointing to your 3.6 environment; named `project 3.6`; and another `project 3.5`; now, if you’re flipping from file to file intending to run it against a specific interpreter version, re-ordering the run configuration options will mess you up; and introduce a non-intuitive UI; so, from a UI experience, think about this; how much extra complexity will implementing your workflow introduce into the UI, and how to handle the edge cases?; compared to how many users this is actually targeted for?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I cannot fully understand you, but wouldn't it be logical when the file changes, interpreter for that specific file changes too?; In other words, when you change the file, Run configuration for that file changes too
	0.145	0.855	0.0	-0.296	no; because pycharm is intended to be project based run configuration; not file based
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.8838	I have made it, but I want to make it more efficient....; ok, the question is...how do I print dictionary value, if some variable is the same as dictionary key?; when that variable is found in dictionary, and it matches the dictionary key, I want the program to print the dictionary value that is associated with that key that matches that variable
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	you mean something like a dict `{'a'=0, 'b'=1, 'c'=3}` and  a variable `lookup_key = 'a'`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	give me a few minutes to translate the code in english
	0.551	0.449	0.0	-0.5994	no problem.  What’s your native language?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Serbian; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, its `user_input` you’re looking for?
	0.0	0.733	0.267	0.7964	yes; I want to...; when user_input matches a key in dictionary1 (when their values are matched) , then to print the value of that matched key; I don't know how to target that
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.7096	so, `dict` has a few methods on it that you would find useful here.  first, `items()` returns a tuple of `key, value`.  Also, `key()` returns a list of the keys, and `values()` does the same for values; so, here, you would want to leverage `keys()` for your `if user_input` conditional; for example, with your dict above, `addition in dictionary1.keys()` returns `True`
	0.0	0.744	0.256	0.7391	yes, I googled that a little, and I know that it returns the whole list of values and keys, but I want that one specific value from dictionary, not all of them...
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.25	alright; so, if you have `if user_input in dictionary1.keys()`:; and `addition` is user_input; so, you know `addition` is a key in the dict; how do you access keys with a dict?; `dictionary1[user_input]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hey all, if anyone has any experience with selenium I've got a quick question I just posted in learning_python
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	thanks...I did not know that I can target values outside of dictionary...
	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.4767	oh, yes.; but remember, in order to get a value from a dict, you either have to know the key beforehand; eg, `dictionary`[‘addition’]`; or loop through it and doing some comparison
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	aha...makes sense...
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.4019	if you want to simplify things, you can use list comprehensions  `[value for key, value in dictionary1.items() if key == user_input]`; which returns a list of matches
	0.06	0.874	0.066	0.0772	I came from more then a  year discrete math course, and I thought the transition would be much more easier. The most difficult thing in programming so far has been the understanding how the language actually works, quirks, what am I allowed and not allowed to do...
	0.046	0.87	0.084	0.4118	yup; there are two major difficulties, I feel; one: describe what you want to do in discrete steps; two, use the language syntax and tools to replicate the project steps; first language, you typically struggle with both at the same time, because you need to get the syntax and how to use it to do what you want; but after that, its easier to pick up another one
	0.031	0.858	0.111	0.5346	like for me, I originally started in java; and there were lots of times where I felt I was paying the university for nothing more than to feel like an idiot; java and python have alot of good things; I’m equally comfortable wokrking in both; but then, I’m a full stack dev in both languages; everything from server configuration all the way to css styling for a web application
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.1154	java seems okay to me, but java developers often overcomplicate things
	0.092	0.908	0.0	-0.3252	Oh, if only in the spring framework. Much likely in an in-house, custom framework which won't have many nice integrations and features spring provides
	0.0	0.303	0.697	0.3182	sure, I understand
	0.045	0.816	0.139	0.7434	I’ve only worked on two large java projects.  one was in spring, other was in google web toolkit with a custom in-house library; and honestly, the in-house library was about 100KLOC of some of the best code I’ve ever read.  Sure, there were some warts in it that I was glad I didn’t have to implement, but overall the code quality was extremely high.  Most of the problems came with integrating with GWT.. so glad I don’t have to do that anymore
	0.0	0.417	0.583	0.4215	You're lucky then
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.6124	I'm definitely fan of a very specific, well-written, tested in-house library that does the thing
	0.116	0.647	0.237	0.4215	To be fair, originally a lot of that was pretty much required for proper unit test mocking ; In Java/spring
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.34	None of that applies to our current developers, unfortunately
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.3919	Does anyone know how i can split this string into multiple parts  ideally i'd like just the Clearance.png; so if i was splitting it it'd be 'media/', 'Clearance.png' and '?sometexthere'; I have  but i'd prefer it on one line
	0.084	0.813	0.103	0.1687	If it's always a similar format you could regex it and get the groups, but that's less obvious and I'd favor a few lines to a single line if it isn't as clean 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if so, you can use the `urlparse` library; outputs this  
	0.111	0.787	0.102	-0.0531	Yeah i'm scraping with bs4 and the image name ie (Clearance) changes so I can't reference it; Thanks tho <@Meg>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you have the full path available?; 
	0.014	0.908	0.077	0.7713	I'm trying to understand how I can implement the google speech api for my purposes. There's a good example by them `<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/transcribe_streaming_mic.py#L170>` That deals with streaming from a mic. I've gotten this `transcribe_streaming_mic.py` to work. But I'm a little confused with if I should be using async vs sync.... and how to modify this for my use case. I want to only collect up to five seconds of data at a time with the ability to short circuit the `listen_print_loop` if a certain condition is met. I'm think I can put a timer around the `with MicrophoneStream` and I can have the listen_print_loop(responses) throw an exception when it meets a certain condition (timeout= 5 seconds, or correct response). Catch this response in the main and do something based upon it.  I'm going through their api reference docs to see if there's something I can use: `<https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/speech/gapic/api.html>`

	0.0	0.832	0.168	0.7227	`urllib.request.urlopen` is a library that comes with python, while `requests` is a package created by a third party developer; they both do the same thing at the very core (deal with http), but requests is a much much easier package to use

	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.5362	Could someone explain this whole tox.ini thing? Is that just for linters and coverage? Will mypy follow it? Is it deprecated?; <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> seems to make it like tox is all about unit testing
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.6597	It's useful when you need to test your codebase against a matrix of dependencies; i.e. you webapp supports Django 1.11, 1.10 and 1.9; and it also works with Python 2.7 and 3.3+; just `make test` or `py.test` will only test against your current configuration
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.6808	Right now, with my django tests, I'm using manage.py test, but that's inside of the env. I guess you'd use tox as an alternative to starting a specific venv and running the tests; What confused me intiially is that I do use a tox.ini file, but only for flake8 ignores and coverage omit's; but I can't seem to use it for mypy, I need a mypy.ini for that
	0.049	0.839	0.113	0.2263	as tox is widely use some tools allow you to put their configuration inside the `tox.ini` file to limit the number of configuration file; I have no idea if mypy allow that; there might be a command line arg to pass the configuration file
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.4137	His opinion certainly is reasonable; btw, separate topic, why do so many programs not come with man pages? Have nobody done it yet, or are people against it? (thiis is a very general question)

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in general
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.5267	for mypy for example, guido himself said "no it's too complicated" here: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2599> but there's a thousand big projects missing manpages; (not literally "too complicated")

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The XML might be in the _same_ folder, but that isn't necessarily the folder that the program is running from
	0.0	0.685	0.315	0.3182	So, full path is the solution?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Maybe; You get to decide where you run a program from.
	0.0	0.488	0.512	0.2732	Well, I got this: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	typo
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Pyhon vs. Python
	0.0	0.622	0.378	0.3465	Still not getting it :S
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you have typed the path incorrectly
	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.3612	which is at least one argument against using a full path
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.6318	Your most immediate solution is just to type that path out correctly.; Your second solution is to work out why you seem to be running the program from somewhere other than where the XML file is.
	0.118	0.833	0.049	-0.4263	Virtualenvs wouldn't really change the nature of this problem. Mostly it just ensures that your libraries are exactly what you want them to be.
	0.0	0.931	0.069	0.3716	Oh, nevermind then... Thanks again, bro; Ok, another question (I really need to wonder if I really learned Python)... Uhhh; I have this:  And the shell prompts this: `NameError: name 'bible' is not defined `; So, I tried with the `global bible` then `return bible.find(args)` but still didn't work.; And `self.bible` neither works.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Think it was originally written in YAML and King James converted it to XML
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	<@Eartha> if you wanna make rest api I’d recommend you don’t use verbs in urls and use http methods instead
	0.0	0.988	0.012	0.1154	`from typing import Iterable, Iterator, Sequence`  An iterator describes the actual iterator object (e.g. what you get back when you run `iter(some_list)`). An Iterable is some object `xs` that you can do `for x in xs: ...` A Sequence describes an object `xs` that is an Iterable that also allows you to grab a specific element, e.g. `xs[4]` (that is, xs has a `__getitem__` method defined). An Iterable MAY have `__getitem__`, but a Sequence MUST have it.  Correct?; So, when I'm annotating a function, I could use Iterable if I want some duck typing and I know that I won't be accessing a specific member of the object, but I have to use Sequence if I ever access a specific member (e.g. I'll run `xs[-1]` at some point, if xs is the object we're annotating)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	seems correct
	0.077	0.861	0.062	-0.2967	This is all in the context of type annotations btw, which is why the official definitions as found in the docs might not match up; I really wish that the Callable type annotation was more advanced... It'd be cool if I could for example create a NewType for a Django view function, being a "Callable whose first argument is HttpRequest, ignoring all the other aspects". Right now the annotation is `Callable[[arg1, arg2], return_type]`, but there's no way of doing e.g. `Callable[[HttpRequest, ...], Any]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lanita> why would you annotate a django's view function?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette>, it would make it clearer when writing e.g. decorators
	0.049	0.862	0.089	0.1326	<@Lanita> this is a very, very specific use-case. I doubt it's worth it to introduce a custom syntax to handle this case (imo, a good type checker should infer all necessary information automatically), but you can always open a feature request
	0.132	0.768	0.101	-0.2886	<@Lanita> you're implying that type annotations should be everywhere. No, they don't. It would be good if `typing` would support that use-case, but to me it doesn't seem so much critical at all.
	0.0	0.669	0.331	0.8126	Well multiple people clearly think otherwise, as proven by the various issues on mypy with positive response regarding this subject...
	0.016	0.81	0.174	0.9626	Even more people haven't participated in these issues, who may have another opinion. But let's not discuss that.  Again, I'm not against this feature. I just think that a) annotating everything will destroy one of the most important features of python (to me) - readability, b) therefore it would be better to improve static type checkers to infer as much as possible; c) however, I think we can live without type checking in this specific use-case because we lived without `typing` module for a quite long time and sky didn't fall, but d) it won't hurt anyone if this feature is supported. Some folks will definitely find it useful.; That's why I proposed you to create a feature request, and looks like it's created already by someone else
	0.12	0.784	0.096	-0.4215	I have a string with a method name in it, I'm looking for a way to call that function on an instanced object identifying the method by the name of the string.  This somewhat works, but is ugly as can be:  Except, these are inherited objects, and inherited methods aren't accessible.  There must be a better way.; Actually, it looks like  will do that. Slightly less ugly.
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	maybe something like:
	0.136	0.652	0.212	0.1027	Yeah, that's what I found. It will work. Thanks.; A lot cleaner than the mess I had above.
	0.282	0.718	0.0	-0.2411	I'm not sure what you mean.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you’re operating on an instance of a class, why not write a method on instance to take in `self`?
	0.197	0.803	0.0	-0.2411	I'm still not sure what you mean. Example code?
	0.073	0.831	0.096	0.4588	Sorry, got distracted.  I see what you are saying. I think the getattr fits what I'm doing better.; I realize I didn't describe how I got there, so it makes it difficult. It is just a lot of code across different modules.  But, it's from a modular gui in kivy that is listing a pretty version of a method name, the user selects what objects, and from there what methods to run, and kivy then sends on the list of strings. It's been interesting, for sure.
	0.024	0.803	0.173	0.8637	Hi guys!  I just joined this channel.

	0.105	0.849	0.046	-0.4386	<@Luana> can you clarify? those crud operations are based on http methods. but you still want to reference the domain in this case `/album/{some_params}` correct? maybe I’m missing something?
	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.296	Ok little doubt...; Never mind, I was going to ask for floor division in Python 3, found the `foo //= bar` one; *UPDATE*: It doesn't work, proper syntax is `foo // bar`

	0.129	0.705	0.166	-0.0258	<@Jon> can you give more info; if you want help, we need to know what's wrong and what you're expecting
	0.092	0.712	0.197	0.2732	<@Meg> it's giving an error on the last line  I want to shade the entire chart area for certain x regions. In this case, between 5 and 7 (excl.)

	0.076	0.859	0.065	-0.0772	Okay I'll re-post using that; It's just much longer, which is why I tried to generalise it a bit;  No shading is happening...; `x2 = array([989971200000000000,` ..... `990057360000000000, 990057480000000000], dtype=int64)`
	0.121	0.759	0.121	0.0	that's your problem there; because you need to compare on the actual values in `x2`; try `where=numeric_timestamp in x2`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I should make a new list and check if the *numeric* timestamps are in there?
	0.111	0.754	0.136	0.128	no need.  look at my example above; ah, correction; yes; you can use a list comprehesion for that
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	Something like this? `where=[x for x in x2 if x in list]`
	0.0	0.966	0.034	0.2144	so, the `where` param uses a comparison to evaulate as true/false to determine where fill happens; if you pass in a list of values, it needs something to compare with; and the `in` keyword does an exact match; <https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between.html>; ah, correction.; pass in the list there; but you'd have to do it with a division and comparison
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	eg `where = [x for x in x2 if x &gt; numeric_timestamp/2 ]`
	0.0	0.676	0.324	0.34	Where numeric_timestamp is my chosen value
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jon> correct.  In your code example, `numeric_timestamp = 990014340000000000`
	0.145	0.855	0.0	-0.7684	<@Meg>, I dont know if I'm missing something now...  I did `(x2[0] + x2[-1])/2` and got `9.9001434e+17` So then I did `ax1.fill_between(x2, 0, 100, where = [x for x in x2 if x &gt; 9.9001434e+17/2 ], facecolor='red', alpha=0.5)`  It's plotting, but there is no shading If I remove the `/2`, I get `ValueError: Argument dimensions are incompatible`
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.6597	<@Jon> is there a way you can check the list values outside of the `fill_between`?; eg, `[x for x in x2 if x &gt; 9.9001434e+17/2 ]` in the shell; what values are there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm using jupyter, but I can do that in a new cell

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> noted. I need to be wary of being too specific, but I'll do what I can; <@Ciera> see below  
	0.104	0.798	0.098	-0.0422	Because `len([x for x in x2 if x &gt; 990002640000000000 ])` = 457 So then it complains that the dimensions differ. I guess it expects 720 values <@Meg>
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	That gives me a set of values as such:  
	0.21	0.79	0.0	-0.3929	Again, I'm starting to practice everyday so, still kinda new :S

	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.2912	I'm not really sure of what this does `[i.log_group for i in [     x for x in l.list_logs(         param1,         param2, param3     ) ]`; you don't do anythin g on x or i

	0.189	0.811	0.0	-0.7027	Hello there, I'm learning Kivy and, I just got this error:   The problem is that I tried `pip3 install kivy &amp;&amp; pip3 install pygame` and It just doesn't work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lana> is it maybe an additional thing to install ? I suppose `import kivy` is working ?
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	Thanks again
	0.157	0.843	0.0	-0.0772	Oh, I just scrolled up, you know that, sorry
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.6251	Hello everyone! I am building a desktop application that will be uploading images to amazon S3 using `boto3`. However I haven’t figured out the best way to store the credentials to access the bucket.  I have created a IAM User with only the PutObject policy, but how can I request the credentials for this user without having to store it in a file or hardcode it? Any ideas?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Cecelia> Is the app being distributed to end users, or just for yourself?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You can store them in env variables in os as far as i remember
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It is being distributed
	0.061	0.826	0.114	0.6263	The problem with distributing them is that then any user can generate signed requests for uploads to the bucket (if your policy is set well, that may be okay - but I don't think the policy allows you to control sizes). But most cases of boto3 usage I see are webdev (vs desktop) - so I am not sure on the "best practice" other than to maybe have a web-service that generates the presigned urls
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.6369	that would probably be best, IMO; have the web service as a middleman; upload the file(s) to the server, which then would put directly to S3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Would then only asking the server for a session token be sufficient?; The files are specific and generated, being around 100KB, so size won’t be a problem.; This way I can store the credentials in env variables
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't see how asking for a session token is different than the pre-signed URL, which would be the route I would go (that way the load is between the client computer and AWS, not your web service)
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.5399	<@Beula> got it! thanks for the advice!
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.4939	You’ll definitely want to get a bit of a sense for how it’ll be hosted and learn some of the ins and outs of it.; But I don’t know that you need to go as far as installing Ubuntu - I’d recommend Docker.  It has its own learning curve (although personally I don’t find it to be that steep); But it’ll allow you to work in Windows, but run the application in the same Linux environment it will run in on the server
	0.0	0.717	0.283	0.4144	So you would recommend Docker and not Vagrant?
	0.039	0.786	0.176	0.7126	and it allows you to pull in things easily like Postgres or Redis; definitely; if you were experienced with Linux and this was going to be something else to pile on then I might say it’s not worth it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But you’ll need to learn how it’s going to be hosted, and in my opinion investing the time learning docker rather than running linux and how to put all the rest of it together that way will take you a lot further
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	cool
	0.077	0.69	0.234	0.6249	there are plenty of docker lovers here and in <#C22DMH61M|devops> too, so if you get stuck and need help, just ask
	0.0	0.611	0.389	0.7476	do you know if hosts can usually help with this?; it's free?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	We're on a VPS
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you tied to this VPS?
	0.0	0.294	0.706	0.34	For security?
	0.0	0.297	0.703	0.7269	yeah security, ease of management, etc.
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.5106	Oh; So it might be possible for me to make the project on free Heroku to showcase it, then move it or scale up
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup
	0.123	0.769	0.108	-0.1027	I will look into this; It's a bit scary though lol, with the Dynos and the Databases and everything seems to be customizable haha...
	0.0	0.334	0.666	0.717	ha.  it’s not so bad.
	0.018	0.924	0.057	0.6249	it’s mostly a terminology issue, they complicate things with these crazy names like “dyno”; this stuff, in a sense, isn’t much different than what you did.  a “dyno” on heroku is basically just an instance of your application; and you put some files in standardized places so it knows how to run it; the big difference between running a python (or ruby or node) type web app and something like PHP via say Apache is that in Python you’ll usually run the application and have a webserver connect to via its ip address; so the user talks to say, Apache, like normal, and then instead of running mod_php or whatever inside apache, it will run what’s called a reverse proxy and send the connections to your web application’s ip and port
	0.033	0.844	0.123	0.6191	ha.  it does seem kind of weird at first, but it can be beneficial, because for example you can have many workers behind a simple reverse proxy; and it’s also possible to develop locally without needing the whole big heavy apache server
	0.121	0.724	0.155	0.2935	well, weird or not, I am very interested in both Python and NodeJS so gotta learn haha; I saw that Django seems to come with a kind of webserver on its own
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup, so that the reverse proxy can connect to it; and so you can develop locally
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see; So, my learning stack would be: Docker -&gt; Heroku -&gt; Python -&gt; Django?
	0.029	0.804	0.167	0.9246	That’s up to you - you probably could get started with Django on Windows without too much fuss.; But in my experience things like Node or Python projects do tend to be more oriented towards unix like operating systems, so problems can arise.; So yeah, to your original point, putting things in Ubuntu would help there.; But there’s a learning cost, so in my opinion it’s worth it to just learn Docker instead, it’ll give you the same benefits and so many more.; And then too when you go to deploy the site, you can rest easy knowing you are deploying the same thing you developed on.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Docker and Python have some decent courses on Pluralsight if you have a subscription.  The Django course there is kinda old now
	0.0	0.466	0.534	0.8519	oh that’s a good idea, yeah a course like that might help jumpstart things a bit
	0.0	0.692	0.308	0.6652	I don't have an inscription but they give a 10 days free trial
	0.0	0.686	0.314	0.8957	okay; well I suppose I could deal with Docker at the same time as I learn about Heroku; hum <@Britteny> do you have any specific course for Docker to recommend on pluralsight? There's like 63... xD
	0.0	0.585	0.415	0.7783	yeah, make sure you feel comfortable with a simple hello world django app locally first
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.4404	Getting Started with Docker - was good; Also, for Python “Python Fundamentals” and “Python – Beyond the Basics” really helped me
	0.071	0.637	0.292	0.8922	Beyond the Basics is longer, but in my opinion there is no filler.  It’s all great stuff.  Actually, Beyond the Basics I think is the best screencast I’ve seen
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hey guys; Could you list the most typical questions on python interview?
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.34	Is python pass by reference or value?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think that’d largely depend on the position
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I am applying to back-end role
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Junior, or senior?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	by value;); Middle
	0.0	0.462	0.538	0.5659	not all arguments are by value
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	Explain the HTTP Request/Response process; Describe RESTful APIs, HTTP verbs, idempotent, etc
	0.037	0.935	0.028	-0.1531	actually a common related question is about mutable default arguments, since many people don’t realize that each time a function or method is instantiated, it gets a reference to the same object; so if you have `foo(bar=[])` and modify bar in foo, each run of foo() will be modifyin the same default bar; MVC architecture will often come up, as well as perhaps some questions about [No]SQL or any ORMs you have experience with.
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	Definitely, also maybe some basic SQL, joins, 3rd normal form, etc
	0.043	0.829	0.129	0.4588	CORS, CSRF tokens, other security related questions might come up as well.; mid-level is tough for both the interviewer and the interviewee because a mid-level is naturally not going to know certain things
	0.03	0.821	0.15	0.8405	I’m finding this kind of interesting.  When I interview these days, which has only really been for seniors recently, I’m generally looking for qualities above and beyond technical skills.  Your CV and Github / provided code should give evidence of that, and then I just want to understand  -how you solve problems, how do you learn something new, how do you work with your colleagues, how curious are you, how enthusiastic are you, when do you ask for help versus research on your own, etc
	0.0	0.685	0.315	0.5574	yeah I certainly have moved away from a focus on very technical interview questions
	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.6249	yeah I think that’s a good approach.  give people a topic and let them run with it and they’ll tell you a lot about themselves
	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.6249	I like the async/await vs promises, basically language features, or differences between languages even and get their opinion
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	I also like to talk to people about projects they’ve worked on in a very conversational manner.  I find it can tell a lot
	0.0	0.697	0.303	0.7269	I usually ask stuff about what they're into, what excites them, their favorite projects they've been on
	0.057	0.902	0.041	-0.2263	All of the above, yeah.  If they can’t talk coherently about the design choices and trade-offs they’ve made, then they’re not really fluent enough with the tech; For a senior role; I’ve not interviewed for juniors in 10 years, which is a bit sad really as we need to do more of that
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.2263	Looks I am the only "lucky guy" with questions about big O; and internals of JVM; I am more a Java-developer but also looking for a python role
	0.056	0.711	0.232	0.8126	Haha.. wow.  I think it depends on who you interview with.  We’re not trying to be google and have the best engineering team.  We want to solve our customer’s problems, even those they haven’t been able to explain to us
	0.058	0.879	0.063	0.0772	Big O, algorithms, traverse a binary search tree in order, post order, pre order, but then your role has very little to do with that.  I mean I understand needing to know fundamentals but those questions have always bothered me.; But Java roles seem to like those types of questions.
	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.8225	Yeah agreed.  And honestly an interviewer asking those sorts of questions to me is a huge red flag about a place.
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	I am ok with questions about datastructs and access/search time because you use datastructs every day
	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.7003	yeah, that’s true, there are.  and that’s actually an important thing as a job seeker.  don’t settle for a place raising a bunch of red flags if possible.
	0.067	0.745	0.188	0.4767	But there are many red flags though; But writing an optimal solution having 5 minutes when interviewer is near you - it is weird
	0.066	0.934	0.0	-0.1779	Weird and just not how you do your day to day job.  I'm not what information interviewers think they gleaning from a candidate in those situations.
	0.253	0.747	0.0	-0.2584	it's neither by value, nor by reference
	0.08	0.807	0.113	0.7369	That's always been my issue with smaller companies following suit with the "Google style" of interviewing blindly. They fail to realize that these methods are essentially an ongoing experiment executed by organizations that can afford teams the size of companies to crunch the data and adjust processes, and absorb high failure rates (and the corresponding cost) because of their revenue per engineer and never-ending pipeline of candidates due to their size. Google and others are quite open about their attempts to quantify hiring and that it isn't a solved problem. It's all fairly interesting, but many people are too quick to get tunnel vision on the "best practices" of hiring and make it awful for the company and the candidate in the process, creating a market for interviewing skills that, like timgraf said, have no direct relation to day-to-day work.

	0.069	0.931	0.0	-0.1419	not simply like that.; you can take a list of words and sort them with `sort`. but it simply sorts lines from stdout
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think I didn't explain myself
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	❯ echo "a\nc\nb" | sort a b c
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.0387	I want them not "sorted" but without splitting them among lines
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	ok; can you paste that text in here?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'll use a lot of texts (actually, it's for a python project I'm working on), use any Bible verse, for example
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.5853	yea just a sec; <@Charles>  ; the command `tr` replaces text.; so make all spaces new lines. then simply `sort` them. then make new lines spaces; but also note in this case, you will end up with a blank line. so you may want to make sure that may not happen.; if possible
	0.277	0.723	0.0	-0.4696	are you on linux or osx?; whats the error?
	0.234	0.766	0.0	-0.0572	OSX; I don't want that split: 
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.4144	ok with the above, what is the expected output; so you also want to remove comments after the hash `#` ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Nope...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh i see
	0.129	0.625	0.246	0.3818	I just want to NOT split the words; That's frustrating for those (including me) who love to read...
	0.022	0.794	0.184	0.8997	ok. thats going to be harder to do intelligently. since what if those are actually 2 different words; such as is it a new line, or is it a "word wrap" which isnt a true new line. but to bash it looks like one.; joining the lines is easy. with simply `tr "\n" " "` its just where to do it and make sure the split words are kept whole.
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.34	I tried with `tput rmam`; But Terminal just gone crazy
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea.
	0.063	0.8	0.137	0.3818	*FINAL*: Just came from MacOS Feedback page, looks like I'm not the only one with this issue (There's no possible solution right now in OSX Terminal or xterm for Linux Users).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't get it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if thats the case, you can change all only new lines with nothing, and space newline with space. so  ; so. in your example above.; ; `wo` is split onto a new line from `rd`. and `don't` is split from another whole word `want` only 1 word is being split there, correct?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think I'm not getting your explanation
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	what i mean, if `wo` has no spaces before `rd`, meaning its the same as `wo\nrd`.
	0.0	0.755	0.245	0.0772	I just want to disable text-wrapping
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and `don't` and `want` is split with a space AND a new line. so that its actually `don't \nwant`; then you could work with that.; since `SPACE` + `\n` always means whole words.; and `\n` by itself, is a slit word

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	through the orm you would have to look through all of them and .merge() them to the system.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, the fastest thing you’ll get is using the core.
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	sort of like doing a raw insert in a for loop 1000x times
	0.0	0.647	0.353	0.5994	Moving the commit out of the loop will likely help a lot
	0.0	0.719	0.281	0.5719	yea; it will commit everything at once.; remember that the session is like a recorder.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, that was my other question
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it records everything in order and executes everything in that order when you do `session.commit()`
	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.0572	<@Chu> Why don't you want to use `loads`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	your loop above is doing an insert statement for every iteration.
	0.056	0.944	0.0	-0.296	I'm receiveing string from client side and need to store in database as is. But I need to know that my json is valid. (There is no way to make json field in db, too large db under load)
	0.216	0.784	0.0	-0.296	it depends <@Orpha>. how many inserts do you suspect?
	0.148	0.736	0.117	-0.2316	<@Orpha> If there's no good reason why you need to commit after each one, then don't do it. Usually you would commit after a coherent block of work has been completed. In this case, finishing inserting everything is a logical block of work, I'd say; That doesn't explain why you don't want to use `loads`
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.3818	It consumes a lot of memory and CPU time in my scale. Looking for optimization.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	anywhere from 1 to 7k
	0.126	0.874	0.0	-0.0772	I don't know of a faster way than to use `loads`, sorry
	0.227	0.588	0.185	-0.128	moving the commit out throws the duplicate entry error
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	the commit won't affect that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	well… it does
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	did you try .merge instead of .add?
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.296	at some point, a commit will happen, and your duplicates will get found
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	not yet; only tried moving the commit out
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	moving the commit is to speed things up, that's all
	0.0	0.752	0.248	0.6059	for ultimate performance gains i urge using the core.; but if that isn’t of utmost importance … carry on.
	0.258	0.742	0.0	-0.5437	not the most important; so merge needs an existing object?; ah, same duplicate error too
	0.242	0.758	0.0	-0.7184	ah, forget it… ill just leave it as is… it works, and it’s not slow at all… was just bored seeing what other way i could quickly change it to
	0.045	0.896	0.06	0.2023	argh. i keep getting slow connection and connection errors to websites. happens both at home and work. both of which are pretty fast connections. at least 100mpbs. even google search stalls. some times i have to hit the search button again. not connected to vpn. even in incognito window. and other browsers.

	0.164	0.74	0.097	-0.5187	cool. i havent used that one. i do like vivaldi but the lack of tab sync across devices is a no go for full time usage for me. for personal use at least
	0.0	0.33	0.67	0.7264	brave is more security oriented.
	0.085	0.78	0.134	0.1027	could someone help me with this python code? I’m trying to build my own tuple by looping through a list and adding them to the tuple, but something seems wrong and I can’t really figure why:    What i want my widget.choices to look like is   
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.1901	What does `widget.choices` look like in reality? You are modifying a list `l` but then you assign `myTuple` to `widget.choices`. Also know that `(myTuple)` won't make `myTuple` a tuple, if that is what you were thinking the paren would do in that case.
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.6908	Looks like you want a tuple of tuples.; When you're better off using a list of namedtuple; Or any other object that isn't tuple of tuple
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Looks like your widget.choices is waiting a tuple of tuples…
	0.155	0.71	0.135	-0.0772	well I just figured my mistake, I had to give widget.choices `l` instead of `myTuple`
	0.083	0.845	0.072	0.0387	Anyone know of a way to make the `pd.read_csv` function change the header columns to lower case during import operation?    I'm currently pre-processing each input file to make this happen, but it feels like something that's a common enough problem that I've overlooked a feature.; `pd` being pandas in this scenario; The ordering is important, as you can't be specific about which column names to bring in, if they don't match case.
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.3182	can you be sure there won't be duplicate column names?
	0.194	0.647	0.158	-0.128	Yep, all my datasets are from database dumps of individual tables
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	  <https://repl.it/Knzz/3>
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.6124	I think I have one dataset based on Oracle (which loves all uppercase field names), and 10 others which are always lowercase
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.7096	I mean, you can do conversion after import, but I don't think the `read_csv` options allow column name case change; I mean, ther eis a `converters` option, but that's just for you to apply functions to convert values in specific columns
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.3384	<@Adrian> this way works really well if you need to keep your items intact.; You can apply a lambda function for pandas on import; <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15799>; ; <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/anonymous-function>  ` double = lambda x: x* 2` is equivalent to :  
	0.0	0.725	0.275	0.4215	Ohh, okay, I can make that work.  didn't realize usecols was that flexible
	0.0	0.736	0.264	0.9185	It's really amazing; The reason it's better to use a named tuple is you can preserve your relationship between the first and second item. You don't have to worry about inserting in any order. You can also do things like create a dictionary of named tuples.
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.25	<@Adrian> and are you using this for a ChoiceField by chance? It doesn't _have_ to be a tuple I don't think, it just needs to be iterable, so `l` probably works as is
	0.036	0.872	0.092	0.4266	Even if it needs to end up being a tuple. It's better to keep it in an some related object until you need to raw tuple.; That way you can have it throw exceptions when you want do :  a, b = item.var1, item.var2  if it tries to unpack a None or wrong object you can catch that exception to prevent an error.; Yeah I have lots of shitty experience with importing terrible pandas csv; csv with variable header location, first few rows with 1,2 columns and the header being at row 10, but row 11 has len(row_10) &lt; len(row_11) and you only want the data that's in that extra row.; Because the developer didn't think naming that column was important.
	0.059	0.879	0.062	0.0258	i gave up on giving up, got rid of the orm stuff… made a list of tuples and insert ignored them; dont need to update because the url to the file wont change even if the file does
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you remind  me about the question/.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hello I have a question
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I ended up using this to fix my mixed case header lines: 
	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.8271	but, it works, its good, thanks for the advise <@Johana>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	go ahead and just ask <@Claudine>
	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.3818	Hello all. This is the very first time, I am trying something like this in Python. I need help.  I am writing a script that reads from a csv file and gets only the headers and then I need to insert those headers into a table on SQL, but how do I define the datatypes ? I can only read the header names from csv and not the datatype of each column.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you using a python database orm?; why do you need to define data type?
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.876	I am trying to create ddl statement which would like create a new table on the sql using the columns I extracted from csv.; How would I define the datatypes for those columns then ?; CREATE TABLE TABLE ( COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE(SIZE));; As per that definition, I would like to define the datatype and size.
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.6249	So if you are reading in csv, you are reading in a string.; you can represent other items (int, float, string, char, bool, etc) using strings.; So you need a way of parsing in these values and giving the corresponding string the correct type.; Can you give an example of a few columns in the header and what you know the data type of each to be?
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4019	Yea, so will I have to parse them manually, or are their any methods that are built in that would help me do it ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it really depends on what you have; If one row of data =
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	Let me share the script I have written.
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.3626	`True, 1.01, 2, hi, h`; That will be slightly easier; What you have written is doing it correctly; csv datatype = varchar; or string; csv is storing your data as a string; can you paste an example of your header/ dattype
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	Sure.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If this is a one time thing where you'll never read in this data again, you can make adictionary with the headerstring, in this dictionary you'll have 'head_string':'data_type' then you use that relate to your database entry.; If you do it very often with the same heads, then you can do the same as first option.; If the heads are different and you need to inspect the actual data this is where it gets complicated.
	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.4215	I try to set the logging level to `DEBUG`; I apparently dont understand how python logging works; but debug statements still dont print; Here is an MCVE: ; which prints: ; no debug2
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.3818	You need to call `logging.basicConfig()` first to ensure some handler is set to format it
	0.275	0.083	0.642	0.6597	wow; thats super dumb
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.094	0.802	0.104	0.0534	yep. So weird that you have to call it for anything to work.; would expect that to be default
	0.048	0.903	0.048	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig> &gt; Does basic configuration for the logging system by creating a StreamHandler with a default Formatter and adding it to the root logger. The functions debug(), info(), warning(), error() and critical() will call basicConfig() automatically if no handlers are defined for the root logger.
	0.255	0.745	0.0	-0.34	well.. I thought I was crazy for the longest time
	0.0	0.698	0.302	0.6369	Haha, yeah - python logging could use an overhaul; e.g. make it pythonic for a start
	0.0	0.782	0.218	0.4696	idea for a 3rd party package?; a pythonic, sane, logger?; that uses `.format` syntax
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I mean, it could just read the stack
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Signe> <@Beula> I recall reading an article about <https://github.com/jd/daiquiri> It set up a modern logging configuration so you don't have to
	0.126	0.649	0.225	0.2255	I worked with a guy who spend a huge amount of time writing his own logger.; really smart guy, but it was a huge waste of time
	0.108	0.765	0.127	0.1002	I used logzero and I can't recommend it enough. It's relation to logging is like requests to urllib. <https://github.com/metachris/logzero>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hi
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.5514	hey <#C07EFMZ1N|help> -ers, I’m looking at the documentation for `functools.partials` (<https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools.partial>) and it’s pretty late. Can someone eli5 why the example assigns  `.func`, `.args` and `.keywords` attributes to the returned function?
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.4019	<@Winnifred> It's just showing how they implement it, so the short is they store the "partial application" as attributes on the function object; You can see the source here: <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.5/Lib/functools.py#L240>; Then later when the partial is actually called, it merges any additional args/kwargs with those stored values and calls the function
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.6767	Is this an acceptable way to build this SQL string? In its current state, it works.; is there a better way to achieve this goal?; I had asked a similar question yesterday and was advised to read the following article.; <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Virgen> not if any of that data is from a user input/untrusted source; That opens yourself up to "sql injection"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the data is from an API.
	0.0	0.724	0.276	0.6369	It's still best to use parametrized queries - what db are you using?
	0.215	0.785	0.0	-0.6369	I get a JSON dump from the API, this then builds the sql statement to dump the data into teh DB.; mssql2016 express
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with `pymssql`?  
	0.0	0.693	0.307	0.6966	pyodbc; is  a better option than ?; how did you get pymssql to format like that?
	0.025	0.852	0.122	0.6878	<@Beula> which do you use? And, out of curiosity, what db do you use? I'm pretty new to this, so I would rather spend my time learning on what most people use. I mean, if everyone uses pymssql, I don't want to waste my time with pyodbc.

	0.103	0.745	0.152	0.4019	Hey guys; I do not understand how this for loop works no matter how hard I try to understand; In layman term, what is the best explaination for this kinda for statement
	0.0	0.688	0.312	0.7096	<@Rosalind> did you try to open it up to a 'normal' for loop?;   Hope this helps
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is it the same thing??
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.5423	yes; but you can use the one liner to create an array variable, ex: ` NON_STOP_WORDS = [Word for Word in WORD_TOKENS if not Word in STOP_WORDS] `
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How do you actually break it down?
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2255	It's more like a yield than a return; but otherwise spot on
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.7142	Because sometimes, there are cases like (word in word_token if not in word_token etc etc; Ohhh!; Word (Yield) for Word (for loop condition); True??
	0.0	0.797	0.203	0.4215	`(yield) (for loop) (condition: if True then yield)` does that make sense?
	0.0	0.574	0.426	0.7708	Oh man, this is so helpful ,thank you so much sensai!
	0.142	0.858	0.0	-0.323	The regular case is `[x for for x in thing]`. Adding the conditional allows you to drop elements if you don't want them.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see, i see
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.4019	yes, more often (I) use it without the condition

	0.068	0.932	0.0	-0.2411	So you are saying that your application itself is running, and it is `uWSGI` that isn't? If you aren't sure, start at the application, then step to uwsgi

	0.164	0.836	0.0	-0.5994	no if you are getting the gateway error it’s connecting to nginx on your machine, it’s something about nginx routing to the uwsgi socket; who owns it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my username and www-data
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.3612	and your username is the one in here: ; like, instead of “sammy” it’s “msorja” or whatever it is
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	yes; exactly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what happens if in your ini file you change `chmod-socket = 664` and restart it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	which command for restart?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`sudo systemctl restart myproject`
	0.688	0.312	0.0	-0.296	no difference
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what are the permissions on that socket file now?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`srw-rw-r--`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, but when i write `groups` it doesn't print out the `www-data` group ¿
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in the ini file, change `socket = myproject.sock` to `socket = 127.0.0.1:5000`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just quickly - could you explain briefly the difference between sock and port?
	0.0	0.679	0.321	0.2235	shouldnt i stop in between?; myproject
	0.193	0.614	0.193	0.0	oh, oops, yeah.  stop, or just restart should work
	0.154	0.749	0.097	-0.0772	yeah, I have no idea then, sorry.  I do know we’ve seen other people come in with issues specifically around that tutorial
	0.064	0.783	0.153	0.4094	yeah; vps configuration not cool; especially when it's my first and haven't reinitialized it in like 5 years... a lot of old configuration there, even some might be overlapping
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	; any idea why it looks like that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Probably the colour channel order is not what is being assumed
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And how do i fix that :)?
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.0772	why would you want a function that only init a class ?
	0.044	0.932	0.023	-0.2911	<@Ciera> so we don't have to import the APIs all individually, we can just import one "importer" and tell it what we want and it will find it; this is actually used in a fixture for pytest, so we avoid having to make a fixture for every API, just 1 one fixture that can import them all
	0.109	0.891	0.0	-0.3491	I don't know a lot pytest but if you really need it I would say the first one. I'm not a fan of using `globals`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or make an `if` statement for each `api_name`
	0.142	0.858	0.0	-0.629	I am kind of with <@Ciera> though i don't love either, myself. In a rare case I have just had a function to init those kinds of things and auto discover them; but that complexity is isolated elsewhere
	0.0	0.948	0.052	0.1901	; I would prefer something like that (doesn't really provide anything here but we could imagine there is other param; but then you still need to import the api modules where you call the function
	0.194	0.647	0.158	-0.128	yeah the problem is `api` is what there are a lot of
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Or a dict of mappings
	0.395	0.605	0.0	-0.2411	example? not sure i follow
	0.061	0.939	0.0	-0.079	+1 - it's clearer and more explicit; ; This is all a bit abstract, so it still feels a little awkward - is this for flask?
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.7096	i gotcha, yeah that seems just a different version of #2; but actually does save a little bit; also i think this method still breaks code completion
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula> `api` classes hold the methods for that particular API
	0.368	0.132	0.5	0.25	wow I am struggling
	0.383	0.617	0.0	-0.4767	they are broken up by function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you a client or server?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	client
	0.049	0.922	0.029	-0.2363	Oh, in that case I wouldn't likely do that at all and would much prefer to explicitly grab what I want if I need to know the name of the thing to get...; You aren't really abstracting anything with that factory - so it doesn't really provide value
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	yes let me push this there
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.4215	<@Beula> it allows us to be able to instantiate all APIs from one place, which for testing is nice; otherwise we need a fixture for every single API
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So?; explicit &gt; implicit
	0.083	0.536	0.382	0.6908	well that's the problem we're solving; right, i agree, but not everyone does; some people favor code tidyness
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.296	No, they are preferring "terseness"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	everyone has an opinion ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	sometimes I just implement something to show the concrete way, gives less time to bike shed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	actually, the dict mapping does *not* break code completion somehow...; interesting

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You need two backslashes 
	0.0	0.643	0.357	0.6124	<@Beula>  can you please help me understand? I am a newbie to python
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> can i comment it out somehow? it was working with a static page
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and I think you need to use `proxy_pass` and not `uwsgi_pass`
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.5267	&gt; The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character; From <https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html>
	0.0	0.798	0.202	0.5106	it might be working fine like this. It's just that usually 80 is for http and 443 for https
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh, i wanted everything to be https, i found this from some tutorial
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	When you are working with backslash on print, you have to put a second one print('/\\  /\\')
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.5859	The short of it is: certain characters have special meanings when escaped and they are escaped with a backslash, so to print a literal backslash you need `print('/\\/\\')`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you try that; and is the port 5000 or 5001 ?
	0.136	0.814	0.05	-0.5859	5k1 if i run manually now; oh yeah, something new, `Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status nginx.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.` when i try to restart nginx `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	-&gt; 502 coming if not running manually  -&gt; 502 coming if running manually; `No journal files were found.`
	0.09	0.833	0.077	-0.1027	can you do `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log` or for your nginx error file; and when running manually you made sure to change the port in the nginx config ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup; <@Ciera> `invalid url prefix...` with your configuration
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`proxy_pass <http://127.0.0.1:5000;>`
	0.096	0.904	0.0	-0.1779	doesn't work; as in prolem 502 persists :s; it's weird, because connecting to the port &lt;ip&gt;:5001 works
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there something in the nginx log ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nothing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you connecting with the ip or the domain name ?; and if it's domain name is the dns correct ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	trying both; correct dns; the situtation is, i am using the same vps and nginx configuration to serve static files for different dns
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`less /var/log/nginx/access.log` something in this ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so you have a working nginx on the vps for other domain ?
	0.0	0.934	0.066	0.2144	yes; but they're serving static index.html file(s); `sudo netstat -peanut` doesn't even show usage of the port 5k; should i try to go back to the sock usage?
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.2023	if the curl to the port work it should be fine
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you mean
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you said connecting to the port works ?
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.4696	yes, if i run it manually; should i keep it running manually? is what i meant; _is there a big difference between socks and ports?_
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.296	no not a big difference; sockets are usually a bit faster I believe
	0.219	0.781	0.0	-0.4215	i got it working using sock somehow, but there's no ssl now
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	to have ssl you need nginx to listen on 80 and redirect to 433 and listen on 433; you can do that like this
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	is there a default config for this?; thank you, let me try it out
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.7689	yeah; okay, cool, progressing. now i get "Your connection is not private" error from Chrome, and if I enable cloudflare I receive 502
	0.129	0.725	0.145	0.0613	oh yeah I'm not sure you to set up all that with cloudfare

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I believe SQLAlchemy should handle it for you as long as you declare a mapping and use the "?" to pass in parameters into your query string

	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	<@Dominque> like for your local development machine or something else?
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.7609	Hello,  I'm trying to run this condition `int(np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))) != y` however I've been getting this error for a while and can't seem to debug. I'm new to Python and Numpy. Here's the error: `ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.`  Code: <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>
	0.243	0.593	0.163	-0.4019	Probably best to break it down into individual steps so that you can see from the error line number exactly where the problem lies. e.g.: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> I can tell that its `np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but is it the np.sign call, or the weights.T.dot call?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Its the .dot; Here's a sample: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it expected that the elements in points are arrays?  how was that constructed?  do you know the expected dimensions?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Junita> i constructed points using this function: 
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.34	so points is the return value of `generate_data`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup; Full code here <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>
	0.04	0.895	0.064	0.2714	If I replace np.array with np.matrix `shapes (3,) and (1,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 0) != 1 (dim 0)`; So I guess my vector V is now the problem but I replaced the np.array with np.matrix as well which yields `only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`
	0.097	0.759	0.144	0.5023	so, you can give a shape to `np.random.uniform`; although I’m not 100% following what you are trying to do - but yeah, I think trying to construct it the way you are is at fault; also, I seem to recall a tip of avoiding rank 1 arrays like that, where it’s better to use a vector (i.e. something of shape (n, 1) vs (n,)
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	What does the whole traceback look like?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> 
	0.043	0.793	0.164	0.6776	Not as helpful as I'd hoped. I think you just have to make sure that `points` is the same shape and size as `weights.T`. You might want to print both those values out to see what they are, and try and use that information to make the necessary adjustments
	0.03	0.824	0.146	0.6382	I have a `pytest` dilemma. I have a a `conftest.py` that's gotten to be pretty huge, since it contains a lot of fixtures (around 1500) lines. I know I can have several `conftest` files but I kinda like having all my fixtures bundled together. Ideas anyone? ; I guess that makes sense
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3612	Sounds like you know the options, I personally nest my test folders and Cascade the fixtures down, and only "promote" them to a higher level when they're needed

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Junita> I meant as in how do you manage dev environment config and prod environment config in the same project? I'd tend to go down the system environment variable route but I'm wondering if there are other options
	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.4927	I find this description quite good <https://12factor.net/config>
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	ok, by streaming, do you mean chunking with `csv`?
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.4215	yeah - i just want to read in the data and write it back out after running it through one function - i just dont want to read it all into memory
	0.137	0.863	0.0	-0.4019	hmm.  hmm; <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/88885/efficiently-filter-a-large-100gb-csv-file-v3>; its a similar problem as you have, so you might find some tips to try there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	using the `csv` module you can iterate over a `Reader` object which is a generator, so you won't load it all into memory; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader>
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	what is a good way to measure/test whether or not its properly running (e.g. using or not using a bunch of memory)
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	Yep, +1 for the csv.reader:  ; you can do `free -m` on a posix machine (linux, mac)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it shouldn't since you only have a row at a time
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you familiar with the concept of generators in python? 
	0.0	0.698	0.302	0.0772	thats exactly what I want
	0.158	0.734	0.107	-0.2263	I think `panda` had some nice tools for handling csv, but 8 have no experience with that 
	0.0	0.768	0.232	0.775	playing around with the suggestions now - will be back shortly lol; yeah i saw a few answers on so about pandas; but i dont use it much, ive found other workaround sometimes suit better at times
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.296	It may be overkill for your needs though ; <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html>; Can you share the code you used? 
	0.111	0.754	0.135	-0.0316	Well you kinda misused the csv module there. You don't need to implement the iterator yourself, reader is already an iterator ; I'm on the phone so forgive the crude syntax : 
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.5994	Well for off you can use `DictReader`that will return a nice dict object per row ; Ah gotcha 
	0.0	0.957	0.043	0.0772	basically i want it to write to file in real time - so i can preview results as it is building if needed (which I do a lot); thats the only requirement really for me
	0.219	0.781	0.0	-0.2411	Not sure what you mean by real time... 
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.2732	Maybe. Well I'm off for now, night 
	0.141	0.821	0.038	-0.5423	I have a problem when trying to use .update on a dict from a json file; It seems to disregard the dict from the json file and replace it with the dict I want to append
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kati> I get back: ; which is the expected behaviour; are you expecting something different?
	0.0	0.708	0.292	0.6369	I want it to append the new value to the already existing dict from the json file; like this  
	0.0	0.972	0.028	0.0772	ahh; so `update` is not a deep update, it only does one level of keys, so that entire `posted` key is getting updated with the one from your new json; if you want to update a key inside the dict, just call update on that key's dict; `get_json_dict['posted'].update(my_sec_dict['posted'])`

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	e-mail address is just text, it doesn't differ much from "foobarbuz"; It really could be anything, unless you know _something_; i.e. which program have been used to encrypt that string

	0.26	0.74	0.0	-0.2755	You can't. It doesn't work like that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i need to know if it is md5, base64, sha256..
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	These aren't encryption algorithms. These are hashing algorithms.
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	ok; so, is there how to discover which hashing algorightm?
	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.8225	Only by hand. You should learn about all these algorithms, how they form a hash and why base64 is actually not a hashing algorithm; I can tell that it looks like a base64-encoded string, although the decoding doesn't give me anything remotely useful
	0.0	0.636	0.364	0.631	ok. I will do that; but it is definitely not md5, right?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	Yes. md5 is a hex string, it cannot contain letters except for a-f

	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.5719	are you sure `sensor.getLongitude` is a value and not a method?; also, you have a misspelling with `frequencyUpdate`
	0.14	0.74	0.12	-0.0772	Sorry, it's true. Now the error is "doesn't exits relation «sensor»" LINE 1: INSERT INTO Sensor(name, value, location, unit, frecuencyUpd...                     ^; The full error is the last one.

	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.34	hi; has anyone here has class variables revert to their previous value after being assigned in a method?
	0.27	0.73	0.0	-0.5719	<@Otha> Negative, can you provide a minimal example to show this happening?
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yep , just sketching one up now
	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.5423	any threading going on, or shared memory?; but yeah - minimal example is key
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Otha> only instance is when a property setter was resetting other class properties inside; eg   
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; in pycharm I can see `myvar1` = ’12345; when I call make_my_thing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You are using class variables, not instance variables there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but as soon as I exit the method, its reverted to None
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.34	e.g. shared across all objects
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	append `self` to `myvar`; eg `self.myvar1` and refer to that in the setter
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; That is what you need; Set it on the _instance_; And then use properties for the set/get logic
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.1695	don't forget to use `self` too; when accessing the properties
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.0772	having said that, I want ALL instances of my class to have these defaults
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	buyt I suppose the __init__ will do that
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do I need to decorate the setters ?; never had to do that before?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In python it's not idiomatic to use "set_value" and "get_value" as it would be in Java; Properties are what you do that for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so why are some of my class variables changing as I require them too; and others reverting to default?
	0.362	0.638	0.0	-0.1779	That is a bit weird
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	basically `self` == `this`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You example doesn't actually work
	0.254	0.746	0.0	-0.1779	weird is what I’ve got too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I think you need to re-try it or edit it

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beverley> If I remember this correctly, it depends on the name of the module; so it looks for `celery_app.py` in `revamp` module
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	ok, and if you try just `celery worker --app revamp`?
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.296	ImportError: No module named celery

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beverley> Are you in the `revamp` module? The module needs to be on your path so it won't look a directory up. If `revamp/` is in `code/` you should do `celery worker --app revamp.celery_app` in `code/`
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	yes working in the module; in the same dir with manage.py for django project
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh so revamp is also the name of the project? Gotcha. What are the contents of the 'revamp' module?; That should contain your `celery_app`?
	0.119	0.824	0.058	-0.3664	what i have is in gallery.colorfest this code; how I got it this creates a celery worker revamp, I only mimick ".celery_app" since it was the last command an example project i'm porting over. if I try ".full_render" I get a missing module error
	0.044	0.937	0.019	-0.0831	Hm I'm not sure, you're mentioning several module names here and I don't know what they look like. Basically the `--app` flag expects to be given a module on python path that has a Celery app config; So you need to make sure that the path exists as a python module if you pass it to `--app`; You don't want to give `--app` "full_render" since that is a task - when you are running a worker it is going to hang out and wait to receive registered tasks for the app, but you don't instantiate it with a task
	0.0	0.635	0.365	0.3182	<@Beverley> please use code formatting

	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.5423	I'm trying to create a function that draws something in turtle in a different place depending on what information is pulled from a certain nested list.; This is the function paste_up(data_sets[52]) - 52 being the list number.; Number 52 for example.; ['X', ['Sheet A', 'Location 1', 'Upright'],           ['Sheet B', 'Location 2', 'Upright'],           ['Sheet C', 'Location 3', 'Upright'],           ['Sheet D', 'Location 4', 'Upright']],
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you also provide the body of function?
	0.061	0.909	0.03	-0.34	Problem is, the variable in paste_up(data_sets[52]) only specifies the section as a whole and I don't know how to target each individual item in the list; Can't be hardcoded, as the paste_up(data_sets[52]) &lt;-- Number is subject to change.; Alrighty, one second <@Ciera>; '''paste_up(data_sets[52])'''; Oops.;

	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.296	No go, I don't think params is the right thing, was just trying different possibilities at this point.
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.6124	In python 3, if you have a list with unpredictable, mixed types, is there a way to efficiently order that list (actual order doesn’t matter, just that the order is stable between calls)? - In python2, I would have just used `sorted`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a list is ordered
	0.038	0.925	0.038	0.0	^ sort; sorry, what I meant is that I want to sort the contents of two lists so that if they contain the same elements (but in different orders), the sorted versions will have the same ordering
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	; something like that ?; oh
	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.1531	yeah, but with Nones, tuples, namedtuples, lists, strings, enums, etc.
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.3612	you'd need an `isinstance` check for each type and determine how to handle the type. At least with a key function you don't end up casting all types to something like string in the result
	0.12	0.711	0.169	0.0258	I feel like this might be an X-Y problem. Why do you want them sorted in the same way? <https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Fabiola> - kind-of, I’m trying to pair-up and remove common elements from two collections of unhashable objects
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you give an example of the 2 lists input, and what you'd expect the output to be ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd suggest using sets, but you can't because they're unhashable? Are there duplicate items in the lists?
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.168	And if there are duplicates, does there need to be an equal number of the objects in both lists to in order to remove them all? ie. is it one for one?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.517	0.483	0.4215	nice idea there <@Suellen>
	0.202	0.636	0.162	0.0803	I suspect it's not ideal, but more often than not an object has a stable `repr`esentation.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Could you use `id` instead?
	0.074	0.647	0.279	0.7717	<@Suellen> - thanks, I thought about that, the idea of repring everything emotionally hurts me, esp from a performance side, but maybe is best
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id>
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.6868	I've made some progress.; ; The code now iterates through the list but I'm unsure how to get it to target a specific "data set" in the list?; ; Paste up is triggered with the following.; ; Am I missing something simple <@Ciera>?
	0.113	0.795	0.092	-0.128	yeah that's because `X` and `0` only have 4 elements. So you get an index error when trying to access the 23th
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.5023	Alrighty, but how does one get the variable from the command to copy over to the function?; ; I've tried a few different things like *params.; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	your first `for` loop goes through `X` and  `0` you should make a seconde one to iterate through the entries; `sheet, location, axis = entry[1]` Here you just take the first entry but you should loop to use them all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If I try any others I just get this.; 
	0.0	0.81	0.19	0.8261	I'd like a bit of advice. I'm using imagehash to help me find similar images. I have 20,000 to hash, so it's pretty slow. Would either threading, asyncnio, or multiprocessing speed up this process? I've never really used any of these before.
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.7964	<@Amalia> assuming you are just generating a db of hashes than yes they will definitely help as you can hash them independently
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then use the db for lookups
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	any particular one you would recommend?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but if you're iterating over the images each time, expect it to take a while
	0.0	0.634	0.366	0.8316	All the above could help although I'd recommend asyncio as that is most up to date one and definitely worth learning
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Amalia> are you planning to iterate over the image set each time, or are you storing the hashes for later lookup comparisons?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i think just a one time iterate
	0.0	0.679	0.321	0.6369	If you iterate like that then yes it will take a very long time
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.7003	just to be clear, iterate once and then save the results for later lookup
	0.077	0.836	0.087	0.0772	thank you. I assume this still only uses 1 core. As there is no waiting for responses, such as for across the internet, is using aync much quicker?
	0.051	0.808	0.142	0.5279	not really; if you're using multiple cores, then yes; but as far as using one core, you may have to use threading to help out with that.  Not sure if asyncio does that implicitly; you may want to ask in <#C07G5276F|async> about that

	0.023	0.793	0.185	0.9386	Hey What's up guys ! I have a question regarding testing that's been on my mind lately and I was hoping you could enlighten me. So here goes: How do you effectively test a function that makes a call to a website and returns a response object ? Like in the case of a web scraper for example ? (code sample below); ; Is it relevant to want to assert that make_soup called `requests.get` with the correct url ? or should I pass requests as a dependency ?; Not really sure how to tackle this; thanks in advance !
	0.139	0.746	0.114	-0.128	to make sure `request.get` is called with the correct `url` you should mock request for this test
	0.0	0.649	0.351	0.4019	I think this package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-mock> may help
	0.201	0.522	0.276	0.25	I use the excellent responses library for mocking requests: <https://github.com/getsentry/responses>
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.7332	Nice !! thank you very much <@Fabiola> <@Luana> <@Ciera> !; I suppose the same approach would apply to DB insertions ?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	definitely
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are people writing separate functional tests for the APIs at all?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Doesn't that typically depend if the API provides you a "sandbox" or demo env?
	0.103	0.897	0.0	-0.6705	Generally speaking, I don't if I don't have a testing env for them due to rate limits and such; I mock all the major response cases so I know if I can handle the error conditions around their API - generally speaking most places are decent about not breaking existing APIs; Assuming their devs are decent, anyway
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The people I'm working on this with have made some functional tests. I don't know if it's necessary: <https://github.com/keboola/sapi-python-client/tree/master/tests>
	0.171	0.756	0.073	-0.4391	yup. Unfortunately I refuse to use Google Maps/Places, and Factual are discontinuing their Javascript API in favour of an app that semi-secretly tracks their users, so my options for a public places database are very limited
	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.7496	they are very committed to open source, and were very prominent at FOSS4G last month; with the main dev for Leaflet, Vlad, giving three talks
	0.26	0.74	0.0	-0.2755	Doesn't look like they have a places database
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh, thought you meant geocoding
	0.184	0.751	0.066	-0.8662	I haven't used the library recommended by <@Luana> so I can't compare, but the key thing is to mock one way or another. Without mocking, you're not testing your code so much as testing the API / website itself. It makes your tests fragile and slow to run, as network problems will make your tests fail etc.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what about mapbox?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Mapzen? <https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/> Also seem to be big proponents of oss
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.6458	Looks like it has potential. If only their docs weren't written by a frustrated English Literature graduate; I mean, I'm trying to browse it to find out what it actually offers, and I come across a page detailing the Chicken response format: <https://mapzen.com/documentation/wof/formats/#chicken>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	every api should have chicken format
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.4215	<@Gabriele> - what about testability? Classes become harder to test because of composition; The only way I could think of making it easier is passing the class as a param on initialization
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Mixins aren't composition; You can write them as such, but it's still a  "is-a" relationship there
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.3818	Not really, inheritance is always "is-a"; Dynamic doesn't really impact that at all
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.7506	But you can have "is-a" without inheritance, and you can have mixins with all 'private' members which don't really give you any sort of useful 'is-a' relationship.; As I see it, the only really important thing is, "does this object support this interface?"
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.4404	It's not about whether or not you get anything useful from it though; And you are right, that _can_ happen; But that's digressing from mixin not really being composition
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.0258	I still think it's just a matter of perspective.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	For Python specifically, I'd define the difference between Mixin and Composition classes in this way: 
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	Sure
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Gabriele> Is right, a mixin is meant as a type of composition, it really depends on how the mixin class is written; <@Tameika> Are the Deep Learning models populating a database or something? Or are you wanting to trigger the py2 models from the flask app?

	0.019	0.816	0.165	0.897	hey guys, I've been thinking about whether I should use a Mixin or Class Composition. In my scenario, I have a cross cutting concern that I would like to share across a few classes. For concreteness, lets say the class looks like the following:   1. Is it better to write a mixin or use class composition (i.e. initialize the class within another class) 2. Should mixins should keep state or be stateless? 3. Any good reads on this debate?
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.7003	say, we have a Deep Learning model written in python2.x and the next step is to deploy it as a web service. Is it okay, if the Flask REST APIs are in Python3.x; How do me maintain the parity?; True, they should all trigger py2 models as well libraries installed for py2.x
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How are you "triggering" the deep learning models?

	0.159	0.771	0.069	-0.5256	what's the best practice for accessing database credentials for multiple databases in django?; I can't just stick the username/password in the settings.py; <@Meg> I read that, but it doesn't provide a solution for my problem
	0.0	0.531	0.469	0.6486	honestly, that's what I interpreted your original question as
	0.246	0.754	0.0	-0.5994	<@Meg>  <https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/remote_gpio.html>; the only problem is when i follow it line  by line i´m still missing some files
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.3089	<@Cherrie> How does it not fix the problem? You need to load the config from the environment if you can't store it in settings.py
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	<@Beula> is there a way to leverage another settings file?; like a "databases" only setting file
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	eg `dev_settings.py`
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3182	sure
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.4588	Sure, set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='other.settings.file'`; And in that other file extend your base; <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/tree/master/config/settings>; That is how we do it for this community's website; But we also use the environment
	0.055	0.891	0.055	0.0	I tried to move the second db connection to the dev_settings.py, but it seems to overwrite the test_settings which means my tests try to run using a real connection as opposed to a test connection.  I suppose the real conflict is between test_settings and original settings and where to put the second database connection
	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.1779	I guess I am not following you, take a peek at the link above - we have three different settings files (dev/test/prod) that all extend a _base; each adds its customization
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.3182	<@Beula> sure, for your example, when you run your project you're selecting which settings module to run via the command line, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	We override the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` envvar: the manage.py sets the default to "development", testing uses pytest-django (which sets it to testing), and in prod we set the envvar explicitly
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	oh got it, my settings are just misconfigured; thanks <@Beula>
	0.0	0.759	0.241	0.2263	<@Beula> okay I'll use that moving forward.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Has anyone tried using setup.py build_ext with a cpp file that's already been compiled (file.bin) but includes the requisite Python hooks?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would say your config file should mainly have code related to pytest itself. Say, new commands related to skipping tests or such.

I've tried a few things but for no success. Also i wasnt able to find proper documentation on that topic.
	0.11	0.75	0.14	0.1531	<@Charlena> there's no state sharing between lambda executions, you need to use an external store for state
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.1477	<@Charlena> so you want data to persist between Lambda calls?
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	I was able to print 5 when I called hello(); <@Marcie> will do next time. Thanks
	0.0	0.73	0.27	0.7506	Can't you just set global variable at the top of your file?  ; You can also set Environment variables pretty easily which is handy
	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.3612	that can be things like external databases (postgres, etc.), key-value stores (dynamodb, etc.), or if they're direct deps, invoking other lambda functions directly either via API gateway or SQS

	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.5267	Sorry, what?; Whatever gave you that output is broken - that string is a `repr` of a python dictionary; You shouldn't exchange `repr`s of python objects and try to deserialize them; you should serialize objects in a sane manner (for example, using `json.dumps`) and exchange that instead

	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.2732	dont use eval; if its a well formatted json, use `json.loads()`
	0.032	0.87	0.098	0.6486	<@Collette> actually it could be argued that it's one of the goal of `__repr__`. <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__>; &gt; Called by the repr() built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form &lt;...some useful description...&gt; should be returned.
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	<@Eustolia> ok wait. i see
	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.8047	<@Ciera> I've digged cpython hg repo in order to find the fact that this documentation section was added _before_ introducing `pickle` module... but I failed. Apparently `pickle` has been added in cpython v1.2, and there were no such section in the docs at the time.; I think this is a bug in the docs - nobody should ever try to recreate an object using its `repr`
	0.0	0.664	0.336	0.8225	Can anyone help me optimize a function I have written? It really slows down when processing large 'length' values. (function in thread); 
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.296	Ok, I can try to explain what I'm aiming for; the function returns a checksum of all captured numbers, using XOR
	0.0	0.705	0.295	0.7964	the best is to find something useful for you. Maybe some thing you do everyday that you can automate ?
	0.0	0.726	0.274	0.8313	I'm looking for a more efficient way to capture the values I want.   Currently generating a list, then trimming the list down one element at a time, really slows it down at larger values
	0.05	0.894	0.057	0.0918	Yea that was what I was thinking but I don't know the limitations of what Python can do. For example one project idea I had in mind was creating an auto deploy system for my job but I'm not sure if Python is able to move files through ftp
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.0772	all captured number being 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12 ?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	yes, all elements from the first line, then 1 element less, per line
	0.0	0.622	0.378	0.7845	There’s a module for FTP: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html>; tools like fabric are useful though for automating tasks like that
	0.099	0.901	0.0	-0.3612	I added the visual example because it seems to form a pattern, I'm looking to ignore: multiples of length &lt; ignore &lt; multiples of length -1 , but I can't figure out how to write a function for that
	0.0	0.688	0.312	0.778	Ah nice I think this is what I was looking for. Going to read more on this. Thanks man!
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	other lengths follow the same pattern as well
	0.078	0.819	0.103	0.1779	`range(start, stop)` could be useful for that; start being the start of the line and stop (start + length - x); incrementing x by one for each line
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.34	np.
	0.081	0.814	0.104	0.1145	do you think that will be more efficient than list manipulation? I think it will, but I'm still learning
	0.0	0.703	0.297	0.4215	; something like this will get you a list of the captured number
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.4215	nice, can you tell me why you used the underscore in `for _ in` ? that's the second time I've seen that
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.34	in fact it can even be ; `_` is a convention when you don't need to use the value
	0.0	0.554	0.446	0.8832	I see, so I'm just iterating over the values; Thanks for the help by the way, I really appreciate it
	0.412	0.588	0.0	-0.5994	no problem. Do you understand how the code works ?
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.1655	the first one I understand for sure, the second one is similar but I'll need a second look
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.2057	don't hesitate to put some more print in there to exactly see how everything interact
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.1531	yeah I'm going to test the code here in a moment; but it makes sense
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is actually the third or so iteration of the function I've made; It's for a puzzle, but my submissions keep timing out
	0.0	0.455	0.545	0.8625	yeah, I love it; so I'm trying to optimize it a bit more
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	Hey guys. I've been working with Django and I want to learn more pure Python. Any simple projects in mind?

	0.099	0.831	0.07	-0.2716	Hey lads, need abit help with this code. The code was originally writte for Pillow library and ImageGrab.grab, since the output had very bad fps i'm trying to rewrite it with mss library instead.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(not only lads here)
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.5423	Well, you'll want to start by fixing the first bit. Division by zero is never going to end well. Maybe the data you're pushing in to the `lstsq` function is invalid.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hmm I came up with this, but the interpreter is still telling me I've exceeded the time limit ; the only reason I can think of is because of the nested 'for' loops
	0.0	0.961	0.039	0.34	reduce takes a function and an iterable and performs the function on the iterables until only one remains; int(bin(x),2)^int(bin(y),2) is performing XOR on the binary representations of x and y; and the iterable is the second part, in two parts; imap(lambda x: x+start is adding the value 'start' to each element of gen_raw(length); gen_raw(length) performs the function you helped me with earlier
	0.157	0.642	0.201	0.1376	I'm not sure you need to do something like that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	perhaps I'm overthinking it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you shouldn't really need to define a function either
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.3818	maybe I focused too much on cramming a bunch of stuff on that one line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you explain what are x and y ?
	0.0	0.795	0.205	0.7579	x,y: is taking the first two different values generated from the iterator; which it then turns into one value; then when another is generated, it reduces that, compared with the previous value
	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.5423	ok got it; are you sure this is the way to calculate it ?
	0.101	0.783	0.116	-0.0548	to be honest there might be easier ways; I didn't even know about XOR binary before this problem, like I understand the concept, but this method is what I came up with by putting a couple stackoverflow answers together; so it's possible the delay is taking place there
	0.357	0.521	0.122	-0.8735	but I couldn't find an easier way to do xor on two ints than by doing that; sure, no worries; it's a weird problem, I have 24 hours left to solve it
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.4404	might try reddit, then come back here later, thanks again for looking
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.5994	no problem
	0.153	0.847	0.0	-0.4019	Now it works, the only problem is lines that should be drawn on screen rarely appearing
	0.039	0.899	0.062	-0.09	Hi everyone, there's a challenge on which I would like suggestions how to best approach. We have like 200,000 messages which are grouped into (Categories-&gt;subcategories-&gt; tags), A usecase is: (i) Show all Categories on the same screen  (ii) When a user clicks on one of the Category bars, show all of the subcategories on the same screen (iii) When a user clicks on one of the subcategories bars, show the tags under the subcategory.  We are using google charts for this right now but it is painfully slow. How would anyone here go about this?  P.S. The minimum we can go is to set the retrieved data to a span of one week at any viewing time.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; you can't set something to `None` then call it; I don't really know what your goal is, Maybe `node_list.append((left, root, node_value))`; if that's what you need

	0.057	0.912	0.031	-0.5255	Hi!  I've stated using SQLAlchemy in my new project and can not exactly get the relationships part. I have a method which goes over a list of `Candidate` objects, its model has ` applications = relationship('Application', backref='candidate', )` and in that loop I want to merge the Candidate objects to different session. Problem is that it only merges the `Candidates` not the `Application` objects to the other session. I have a feeling that there is a setting that I'm missing either on the merge or model side that would enable saving all of the related models.

	0.181	0.819	0.0	-0.8188	I believe the reason it throws this error "(failed) net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING" during uploading is nginx fails to get permission to upload the file, the folder it should upload to is empty; snapshot from the view of the folder it targets and it's empty meaning it never uploads the file
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.3182	you need to execute a sql query that retrieve data for `fetchall` to return data; and please use slack formatting or snippet. <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages>
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	; do you have any script like that ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you following a tutorial and/or are you familiar with sql ?
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.6124	Hey guys,  i am storing time in my model like this "Sept. 6, 2017, 2:21 p.m." is there anyway i can transform this into a date like so /DD/MM/YYYY when pulling it from the db?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you are storing it as a string?; are you using an ORM or SQL directly?
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	that looks like `%b. %-d, %Y, %-I:%-M %p` as the format, except the `%b` locale abbreviated name for September is `Sep` and not `Sept`
	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.644	So once the job has been accepted i run this  `def accepted_date(self, resale):     resale.accepted_date = datetime.now()`  now is it easier to format the date/time before it gets sent to the db? and how?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`.utcnow()` would be preferred instead of `.now()`. And if your DB driver is DBAPI compatible, it will convert datetime's into the correct format for your DB
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.6124	`today.strftime` creates a string, then you try to subtract that from accepted_date, which won't work; You'll need parentheses around the subtraction operation - or better still, to calculate that first, then call strftime on the result
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4588	Okay i have removed strftime from the functions that upload the date when its accepted; and tried it again and it is still showing the same format, Sept. 14, 2017, 9:30 a.m.
	0.099	0.803	0.099	0.0	what shows that, and why is that a problem? You're interested in calculating the days that passed, so I don't see how the format is applicable
	0.039	0.874	0.087	0.3239	the text format doesn't matter; the difference between dates is based on the value stored in the date, not the way it displays it on screen
	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.2263	ah okay, so its just a case of comparing them
	0.0	0.69	0.31	0.4019	yes, diff will be of type `datetime.timedelta`
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	If obj.accepted_date is in the right type, yes
	0.35	0.65	0.0	-0.7184	for code blocks use triple backticks with no spaces on either side of the code block
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'datetime.date'`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	One of those types needs to change; You can decide which
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.2732	`today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()` as your accepted date is a `datetime` object and not a `date` object
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.34	  is giving me `can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.1531	and then your diff you're returning, if all you want is the number of days difference, you can `return diff.days`; ah, then change the `.utcnow()` to `.now()`
	0.39	0.61	0.0	-0.8074	ugh, Python UTC handling is a bit broken, unfortunately. I'd suggest using utcnow everywhere, if you can
	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	Still getting the same error,  
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.5719	yeah, ^ agree with that. in general UTC should be preferred for storage. if you need to render date/times in a locale specific TZ, that should be done on the presentation layer; `accepted_date = obj.accepted_date.replace(tzinfo=None)` to remove the TZ Info
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.7184	I believe that both .now() and .utcnow() are offset-naive in Python (even though that is clearly incorrect for UTC). You will need to make sure that obj.accepted_date created in the same way
	0.29	0.71	0.0	-0.5994	<@Carri> after adding that line i get a new error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace'`
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	Same error that we mentioned above - accepted_date is None
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this telling my the accepted_date is a type of none?
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.3182	You need to make sure that's set before calling this
	0.301	0.577	0.121	-0.2783	You don't want to be returning an empty string when there's no accepted date
	0.081	0.823	0.097	0.1969	The error was because accepted_date was None. That doesn't mean you want to return a string in that case; Whatever is calling that function either should check for the presence of obj.accepted_date first, or your program needs to ensure there is always an accepted date
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	You have a `timedelta` object, so you can use whichever of the fields you like, and write them into a string: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects>
	0.045	0.955	0.0	-0.1189	One more question before i leave, in the model admin view some columns can be filtered by pressing the bar over the column. how can i make this work with the column i just made?
	0.175	0.7	0.125	0.0	no idea, sorry. I know nothing about whatever admin view you're talking about; Looks like a job for <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's telling you that `accepted_date` is None
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you returning the `resale` object from your function before trying to persist it ?
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.1027	hi; i search for freelancers man

	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	Hi , how to pass values from one function to other functions
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; it's the same whether you call one simple function or a very complex one
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Suellen> if my function name is *create_query(customer)* means i have to use result = create_query(customer(value)) or can you tel me the format
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is `customer` a function?
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.25	alright, so your function needs a customer object; and you give this function a customer: `query = create_query(some_customer)`
	0.0	0.526	0.474	0.4019	yes. you are correct
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.34	where do other functions come into play?
	0.0	0.654	0.346	0.4019	; I want to pass the value to next next functions.
	0.0	0.566	0.434	0.5574	well, just call them like you normally would; 
	0.0	0.611	0.389	0.6249	<@Suellen> can you share any link for my better understand
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.4466	<@Bell> <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm>; Any entry-level tutorial on functions is OK.
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.1406	well, OOP basics are the same regardless of language; jsut Python doesn’t have interfaces; but there are alot of differences
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	and supports multiple inheritance, while C# does not
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not a whole lot of overlap

	0.094	0.87	0.036	-0.4682	Hi! I want to reailize the functional "get_or_create", as it implement in Django models. I know how do it with defaultdict. But this method has many disadvantages  . Maybe i need use some methaclasses? or class Descriptors?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how can i get only package that i use one project
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Georgetta> What do you mean?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	quick question. How do you convert a string to a date and then substract dates from each other; so 2/2/17 - 2/7/17 will give me 5 days
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Felicita> Don't convert it to a string to do any sort of math, you do that with the datetime/date struct; Convert it to string just for presentation
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	timedelta and datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’); i think he’s going from string to datetime obj
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh woops I had it backwards, you're right
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.4404	<@Mallie> <@Johana> Yea I needed to convert it to date because I'm getting the date from the front end as strings; <@Johana> yup will give it a shot thanks; end_date = datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’)                                     ^ SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier; Are there supposed to be spaces?
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	you may need to adjust your import statement of datetime.; `from datetime import datetime`; something like that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Invalid character in identifier... did you copy and paste that line, perhaps?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	actually you don’t need timedelta either. i have some code here where i compare dates. i’m not formatting from a string but it shows the general idea: <https://github.com/openstax/research-p3-experiment-4/blob/master/digital_logic/experiment/service.py#L298-L311>
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.2263	yea I imported it <@Johana>; <@Gabriele> yea I copied it straight. But then I tried typing it
	0.141	0.729	0.13	-0.0516	The error just looks like maybe you copied a character that doesn't work in Python, that's all
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.4019	yea, i got an error on the quotes.; i’ll adjust it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Johana> Are those date types?; <@Gabriele> Yea probably, let me try type it manually
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it’s the quotes for some reason they are jacked up.
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.4019	and yes those are datetimes.; sqlalchemy takes the datetime field from the database and converts it to a python datetime obj.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the dates actually subtract without any conversions. I just need to convert the result into a readable date now
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i just discovered groupby from itertools, how can someone know about these functions if they are not usually covered in courses?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what led you to finding it?
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	yea that’s why they hit the mostly used ones like collections.; and itertools; <https://www.amazon.com/Python-Standard-Library-Example/dp/0321767349>

	0.057	0.891	0.052	-0.1993	Hello! I'd love some help with a mock.patch issue I am having. I am using Django/DRF to run some integration tests. My test is using the http client to make a request to the DRF API. I use service classes inside my API viewset functions to do the bulk of the logic, e.g. I might have a test method that uses `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService', autospec=True)` to mock the UserService class used by the API and this works great. What I am unable to do however is mock the `SMSService` that the `UserService` uses internally. I cannot come up with a `mock.patch` target string that mocks that class. I've tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.SMSService', autospec=True)` but of course `UserService` is a class not a module. I've also tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.login.SMSService', autospec=True)` to target a class function but that also is not doing it. Is this possible - I want the `UserService` code to run during my test but not the `SMSService`.; OK, so actually I was able to do this with a direct patch to `mock.patch('core.services.user_service.SMSService', autospec=True)`
	0.062	0.883	0.055	-0.0772	Do you know any way to generate documentation from a django project (From docstring, etc.), standard tools like pydoc don’t work because many things in the code expect to be run from django directly (So it fails with AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren’t loaded yet.)
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	Hi folks, which youtube session will be good to know abt python for beginner
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.5927	<@Bell> I would look for Raymond Hettinger's videos on YouTube. It may not be beginner enough, but they are invaluable.; <@Bell> SentDex has some beginner videos. He's good at explaining things. The only thing is sometimes he lacks why to do things.

	0.081	0.8	0.118	0.2748	Never used it but doesn't Sphinx:<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/> do that? Not sure if it relies on pydoc...; I mean, it does more, but I think it does that too; yes
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	thanks, <@Mallie>, so on `return`, `context_manager.__exit__()` is called still ?
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.4118	Pretty sure but I'll check for confirmation...; <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>;

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi everyone, any stripe experts in here?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i know a bit; whats up?
	0.099	0.852	0.05	-0.193	Sorry, just noticed your response, I'm also in the Stripe IRC chat lol; I think I've got it worked out, I'm just trying to figure out how to tie up the loose ends in my payment system. I'm not sure if there are things I should be keeping in my database that I'm not
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.5994	ah ok; yea, that just really depends on how you are using it, the stripe IRC can probably help you a lot more
	0.086	0.741	0.173	0.5355	yea, you for sure dont want to store credit cards; stripe can tokenize payment methods, thats probably what you want to use if you can
	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.3182	ah gotcha, thats more your app code then… just gotta test it over and over and over and make sure you only call things when they need to be called
	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.4939	yea, you should keep track of transactions; who paid what when; or who was paid what when; depending on the direction of money flow; there are many ways to do that too… basically, it’s a log of what you need or want to track… with any log, the more information you log, the better, because who knows when you need xyz
	0.0	0.66	0.34	0.4753	true true!; I mean it's logged within Stripe
	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.5292	but its still a log, so dont stress about it, you should at minimum track the who was paid what when stuff; yea, you should keep your own log too though
	0.042	0.9	0.059	0.2023	But the reason I ask is when customers change plans the easiest way for me to do it was to have them cancel their current subscription and sign up for a different one, rather than use the stripe upgrade/downgrade stuff and deal with changing billing cycles etc
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe your system things someone got paid, and stripe doesnt show a refund… this is why you also need a log
	0.0	0.729	0.271	0.7845	so when I do that and delete the customer to start fresh it wipes their billing history.; ok, cool; I will probably create a payment history table for each user then
	0.094	0.765	0.141	0.0875	ah, you should for sure use stripes (or your own) upgrade/downgrade; dont let users cancel then signup again; you will likely lose people that way
	0.0	0.709	0.291	0.4767	lol; i mean, its your app.. so you can do what you want
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It takes about 2 seconds to switch though, I couldn't see people really having an issue with that
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.296	Yeah I could do that. I might ... this was just the fastest/easiest way I could think to get it working
	0.0	0.303	0.697	0.3182	for sure
	0.1	0.836	0.065	-0.3182	traditionally, this is done by having one list of transactions, and the expenses having a negative value, this way you can just sum one list, it also makes several other common operations much simpler

	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.849	Got a question about `threading.Thread` (_I'm fairly new to working with threads &amp; am not 100% sure about what's going on behind the scenes_) .  I'm generating some live MIDI signals, and found that if I use `thread.start(); thread.join();`, the thread becomes blocking and I lose realtime functionality. Alternatively, if I only use `thead.start()`, without `thread.join()`, the realtime functionality acts as expected.  Are there any potential issues with starting a thread and never joining it? Is joining an optional thing for when you _want_ a thread to be blocking, or is its usage required in some way?
	0.089	0.856	0.056	-0.533	I have a maybe dumb question about the sortedcontainers package. is there a performance advantage to using sortedlist versus a regular python list and sorting after each insertion? as i understand it, sorting is a solved problem at O(nlogn) so whatever sortedlist does to maintain sorting at all times cant be any faster then the standardlib sorting function, right?; whats the performance of binary search using bisection? i think thats what sortedcontainers library uses
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It can be.; If you insert and then sort, you're doing `n * n * logn` which is `n^2`; if you insert something into already sorted container, you kind of already know which position it will occupy (maybe not with 100% certainty)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you just append to the list then sort its 1 + n * logn, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you append every time it's N append+sort operations, and with sort itself being n*logn it becomes n^2
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh right; bisect is logn so, if you use it to maintain the sort then its n * logn, right?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.086	0.844	0.07	0.2319	Not sure if this library does this, but one trick about sorted containers is that they don't actually need to be sorted at all times or after every insert. They only have to be sorted when you try to read from them; So they can postpone the sorts, unless they're trying to provide strong guarantees about each operation
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2382	thats a good point; but the SortedContainers package maintains the order at all times; <http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/introduction.html>
	0.0	0.417	0.583	0.6369	best just benchmark it
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	good call. i’ll do that now
	0.0	0.72	0.28	0.8591	It looks like it uses something like a heap of indices. Personally I'd be surprised if this sort of package made a positive difference to performance, with the extra memory and complexity involved.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i saw it mentioned on a lot of stackoverflow questions about sorted datastructures so i figured it was considered the standard
	0.091	0.853	0.056	-0.296	okay sorted() is blazingly fast; oh wait; derp, i didnt sort between each insert in normalListInsert; only did one insert at theend; gotta rerun it; sorting() after each insert is terrible actually; 
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.7239	; couldnt even run it with 100,000 elements in the list; bisect matches sortedList package up to 10,000 elements then slows down substantially; at 100,000 elements its 1982ms vs 348ms; now i need to read the source of sortedList to see what they are doing; oh neat, it plays on the fact that bisect.insort is fast up to 10,000 elements; and splits the list into multiple sublists that are load balanced; with a bunch more magic on top of that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Catheryn> It makes sense that the sortedList is as fast as bisect, as it uses it internally
	0.0	0.571	0.429	0.5423	Out of interest, might heapq be a contender here?
	0.0	0.824	0.176	0.4588	<https://github.com/grantjenks/sorted_containers/blob/master/sortedcontainers/sortedlist.py#L8>; I honestly wonder why none of these are implemented using a C-written balanced binary search tree
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Tatum> would that be substantially faster?
	0.045	0.792	0.163	0.7067	I can’t tell because I’m not sure of the running time on the bisect algorithm; but using a tree would be O(log n) per element addition; which is super fast
	0.0	0.614	0.386	0.5267	<@Tatum> well sortedlist is marketed as a pure Python solution 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a pure python tree should be faster
	0.0	0.777	0.223	0.9382	Hmm. I have an avl tree I wrote for a project. I'll compare that; <https://github.com/ssbothwell/BinPack/blob/master/binpack/avl_tree.py>; It's fast but it depends on how much rebalancing ends up happening ; I wish the standard library had a bunch of trees built in ; <@Cristy> heapq could be a contender if You only need access to the min or max value of the list. For fun I'll timeit as well

Thanks; Final json response, suppose the user does not have nest_egg in his portfolio : ; <@Junita> That bit works but I need to loop inside the dict to make it deterministic. I am hitting a blank here.; depending on the length of the dict.
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	oh, I see what you are saying.  Do you want one response, that sums it all up?
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.2732	<@Junita> This is the response from the query , Now this user has both the products core_product as well as nest_egg.;  and

	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6369	now these two variables   `core_capital` and `nest_capital` should have the value of the respective products if the user has them in his portfolio or it should be 0.

	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.4767	that is a _really_ ambitious scale; because if you’re running it on your own machine for 100 items, it could take about two seconds per item to execute; that’s about two minutes there to test

I’d look into that to see if that’s possible; it’ll also help because they’ll eventually shut you off otherwise; otherwise, I’d just sort of sketch out your approach on a piece of paper and get to building the individual pieces in isolation, as it’ll make the whole thing feel a lot more manageable

	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.8225	<@Bell> if you are just doing basic queries look at mysqlclient here <https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python>; It's pretty simple and easy to use. There are examples here: <https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/>; If you are doing anything more complex have a look at an ORM like sqlalchemy as <@Fabiola> has said
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	Let me check on the docs and ping later. Thanks for both of you
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why not schedule a task on startup?; your project will have a main.py or something right?; <@Mallie>
	0.051	0.889	0.059	0.6947	<@Vada> Because it is a longer running task and I don't want it to overlap, nor preferably would I have to track state for objects updated (which is an option). Right now I want it to run hourly and it finishes within 30 minutes, but I don't want it to run over itself. Scheduling a task on startup would just mean enqueuing it when the service starts? That would be esp. troublesome in the way I stated because I need to restart the celery services when I deploy code (it is a production Django project). I have hooks to reset the service so it'd be great if the functionality existed so I could just delete the right file or run the right command to run the task on startup but not have the interval locked again to always run 1 hour from when it was originally scheduled.; As it is now it is easily worked around by not updating code related to the task during the interval (:00 - :30) every hour, and if the code isn't related, just restarting the services. So it is managed by controlling releases.; But if I did have to make a critical code update to the task, I wish I could just force it to reset after purging the queue.
	0.082	0.83	0.088	-0.128	I see two options; 1) You have a check (e.g. a cache lock or anything else) which the task checks - if the lock is active the task dies; 2) The task calls itself on finish - scheduling the next run that way; neither would use beat; I think beat is wrong for this if you want to schedule it from after it runs on startup; and definitely wrong if it cannot run concurrently
	0.049	0.833	0.119	0.4613	So (2) is interesting - is there a way to do that in celery? I wasn't aware. Like, I could see the end of the task and say `run again in n minutes`? That'd be fine, I thought `celerybeat` was the only option for scheduling
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.5023	I've not done it myself, but considering python supports recursion, you should be able to just call the task again
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or call an api endpoint for which generates a new task
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	e.g.  
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	you could also do something at the end of your run like  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not always
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.0258	So I didn't realize  existed, nor `countdown` for that matter
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	have a view handler; and post to said URL
	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.5106	yep although  if the only reason you are doing it every hour is so it doesn't overlap, you may as well just do the countdown
	0.0	0.77	0.23	0.5829	Yeah just saw that too hah; I thought the only options were `do now` or `celerybeat` so that's cool
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.5927	<@Meg> but why would that be better than the task calling itself?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah, never mind
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.296	I was thinking recursion depth; and trying to avoid bottoming out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so when a task calls itself, does it get put in the broker?; or does it immediately execute on the same worker
	0.139	0.727	0.133	-0.0258	yeah delay doesn't actually call the task, it posts it to the message broker
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	gotcha; ah, then `run` would execute immediately on the worker
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so it should become a separate stack - although I'd be very interested/surprised if that isn't the case
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	FWIW, I prefer `apply_async` vs `delay`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	They're essentially the same thing righht?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because it lets me specify the args, queue and any potential tasks to run after sequence; `delay` is a simplified `apply_async` with non-overrideable defaults
	0.102	0.681	0.217	0.2144	yeah that's true; I default to delay, but use all of them in some places.
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.9053	So another question, and this may get more into broker specifics, but does anyone know how celery/RabbitMQ would handle scheduling *a lot* of tasks (30k+)? Right now I update a large number of objects via `requests`, so I just queue them up in order once an hour - that was really the only good option with using `celerybeat`, but with what I just learned, it would be conceivable to set a timeout 60 min from the run time for _each_ object at the startup. Approximately 60 min is/will be sufficient for these objects to update, so the container task to just enqueue them (unscheduled) at the same time has been fine and i wouldn't make things more complicated without a reason. Just wondering how it might handle it if I had an interest in doing it differently in the future, e.g. I wanted objects to update at a different rate. So a few parts:  1) Would it have any issue with retaining an `eta` or `timeout` for a lot of tasks (let's just say 100k) 2) Is there a simple way to inspect if a task is currently scheduled?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for 2; you mean personally, or by a program?
	0.045	0.955	0.0	-0.1857	so for 1, no it won't have an issue - but you may have a bottleneck in terms of your numbers of workers.; so regardless of ETA; if there aren't enough workers to get the job done, it'll take a while
	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.872	Well now enqueing them all at once only takes about 30 minutes with current config, so I have an external job to check the stats to make sure it doesn't need to be tweaked and so on. Spreading them out would be perfectly acceptable, it was just unmanageable with `celerybeat` obv.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for 2) You can check what tasks are in the queue and inspect the workers (e.g. <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html?highlight=revoke#inspecting-workers>)
	0.767	0.233	0.0	-0.5106	Ah sick
	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.5046	One of the things we have in house is an RSS feed processor which can't be run concurrently; celery has a cookbook for this; <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time>; specific to django; so that is worth looking at as well
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.5267	I mean in an ideal world you'd schedule a task every time it updates as a post-commit hook
	0.016	0.896	0.088	0.6999	Well our deployment isn't based on a repo action - it is rolled into a single command but it requires someone (me) to tell it to release; But if I were to leave `celerybeat` and just make sure each object schedules itself out at end run, if there is a necessary change it would still affect them all after a release so should be fine; Every release I just restart `celerybeat` and `celeryd` in case related code changes - I have never experienced issues there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but I can see how that misled you
	0.052	0.757	0.191	0.7085	"Our software is so agile we couldn't stop it if we wanted to"; Well sheesh after my experience on SO and talking within other groups I was thinking no one used celery; So this has been great

	0.08	0.849	0.071	-0.1484	<@Gabriele> correlation_tracker is from the dlib library <http://dlib.net/imaging.html#correlation_tracker>. I'm not sure if its safe, but I suppose since I initialise several instances of it, that each instance should be able to run in multiple processes ? (I might be wrong here) About extracting the position, I can execute the command but I don't get an updated position from the tracker, it stays the same value as when I initialised it.
	0.082	0.795	0.124	0.4404	It's hard to make assumptions about 3rd party software although I'd hope that each process would be sufficiently isolated. What is the actual result variable you're watching here, or the function you expect to do the work? I don't know dlib.
	0.038	0.913	0.049	0.1376	not sure if you can follow me; I have a list with objects where I'm trying to call each objects update function and this is where I would like to do it in multiple processes, so each object can update parallel and be done ~the same time, instead of after each other.
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.4926	The pool thing is some old code from old experiments with it. I get your idea and will try it out and see if I can get anything to work.  Thanks for your time!
	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.4574	Hey, guys! Maybe someone can help me with SimpleNamespace. I have several nested SimpleNamespace objects and I need to convert them to dicts:  When I try to use dict() or json.dumps() I get a TypeError. Is there any pythonic way to cast it to dict other than manually iterating over attrs and converting them to dict?
	0.16	0.705	0.135	-0.1027	you can create a custom encoder:  then use `cls` argument on `json.dumps`: `json.dumps(a, cls=CustomEncoder)`
	0.0	0.556	0.444	0.4926	<@Candelaria> Thanks! I'll try it
	0.017	0.922	0.061	0.6136	Hey all, would anyone have a resource for how to run a store where multiple people can sell things through your site for money? I am wondering about how to pay people (handled via code)....are there any services for this? Was planning on using stripe but I have never used it this way before; Oh to clarify I was going to take a small amount of their profit for using my site
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.6486	To get the idea you want an "ebay-platform" ? <@Vita>; <@Vita> it seems like stripe have something implemented like that, if you read this article it's talking about it *Account debits: Some marketplaces charge sellers subscriptions or a fee per transaction — now they can directly debit those accounts.*  <https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/25/stripe-opens-express-sign-ups-for-connect-marketplaces/>
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.6369	Thanks, don't plan on staring this until late this year/early next year because of other projects, but I like to do my research way ahead of time
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.4173	<@Robbin> Could you give more information like what frameworks you are using or at least where the funciton `get_lines_total` comes from?
	0.057	0.865	0.078	0.2057	<@Robbin> Can you give some background. It looks like you are using HTML with flask to replace the value within `{{syntax1 + syntax2 }}` but I'm not sure what those two syntaxes are. It looks like job is a class of some sort along with the bitwise or, or maybe you're trying to use python to interface with bash and using the pipe for some other reason. Or you are trying to do some math operation but I'm not really sure.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm studying decorators- has anyone run across any sites that provide decorator practice scenarios? For instance, they give you some code and you are tasked with refactoring to use decorators
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi there, is anyone here familiar with serving media from an Apache2.4 server for a Django application hosted on Webfaction ?
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	Hi How do I get this to work?   It prints the first one as    I want it as  
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.0772	Instead of `list(v)`, you probably want `v.split(' ')`, or similar
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.1139	I don't want to split the strings, I want to print them as is
	0.09	0.774	0.136	0.2312	It doesn't help that you have a different data type for K3 and K4... that is going to be awkward; okay, so you want a list with just 1 item in it?; (It should probably be a list in the original data)
	0.072	0.705	0.223	0.7024	Well, ideally you'd _always_ have lists as the values, so it's unfortunate your data looks like this. But if you can't change that, you'll probably have to inspect the type; e.g. `tag_list = v if isinstance(v, list) else [v]`
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.7003	ahh. I'll try that, thanks; It works. Thanks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	where do you run that command from?
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.2023	from the top level directory; where requirements file is located
	0.042	0.776	0.182	0.743	Hmm, I don't know then. I find Python very awkward for this sort of thing. Often I have to hack in edits to sys.path to get my tests to run.; An expert probably has a better solution though, so hopefully they'll see this
	0.064	0.707	0.229	0.6556	yeah it's a very strange behaviour; thanks for your input <@Gabriele>!; yup it was an issue with the unittest package; I switched to nose and now it works fine
	0.121	0.879	0.0	-0.3566	I switched to pytest myself. But I run it from Pycharm so I've no idea how it works outside of there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`assert`, fixtures, plugins, parametrized fixtures and test cases, test functions instead of classes...; lots of things, actually; They have only one thing in common: they're both test runners.
	0.108	0.731	0.161	0.1655	it has some magic fixture stuff, which looks pretty but which I dislike because of the magicness. But I'm sure it can make for quick test development
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4019	Not really the same thing; In this case I'm talking about decorators that magically rewrite things to inject arguments
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^ that's my biggest concern, too.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why magically? they just rewrite things, not magically
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.0772	I'd rather want to explicitly request fixtures to use in test functions
	0.0	0.669	0.331	0.8126	All sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. This is advanced and mostly hidden, so I call it magic; "explicit is better than implicit", right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i.e. 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> you can do this :))
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Link?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#usefixtures>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's not the same.
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.4215	I guess of that list, plugins could be nice
	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.4215	in older pytest versions this was the only way, but now you can do it implicitly too I remember the older tests I've written when there was no fixture injection.
	0.096	0.822	0.082	-0.0798	the others I seem to be getting away with on my own just fine.  I mean it’s not like I don’t have fixtures.
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.2732	In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, "enabling" fixtures for that test function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and you could always test functions instead of classes, right?
	0.115	0.885	0.0	-0.357	<@Junita> what? `nose` is a runner for `unittest.TestCase` cases, you can't write a dedicated test function and expect `nose` to discover it
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.4549	&gt; Within a test module, functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests <https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>; I mean, I’ve done it, the docs say it, so you definitely can
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm, i guess information in my head is outdated then; but you can't define `setUp`/`tearDown` for these test functions, right?
	0.068	0.864	0.068	0.0	yeah maybe at some point in the past you couldn’t, it’s possible; To my knowledge, no.  If I’m going to do `setUp` and `tearDown` I’m going to just use a class
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	'they'?
	0.044	0.913	0.043	-0.0129	&gt; In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, "enabling" fixtures for that test function; I think I'm missing something, but the behaviour seems identical to me
	0.33	0.565	0.105	-0.8479	I was thinking about the case when  passes, but  fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments; I also dislike that whole `pytest.mark` idea. It's so highly dynamic that introspection doesn't work
	0.299	0.627	0.075	-0.7591	&gt; fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments It was like that before they decided to make fixtures available by default, which is not really nice... I agree.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Maybe given py3 annotations, we could at least do ...
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.7178	I wish some projects, especially that can hugely benefit from annotations, dropped py2
	0.052	0.782	0.165	0.7461	I have almost zero experience with Django, but if it's anything like Flask then lack of certain py3-only features doesn't really stand in the way too much. But some flask extensions are py3-only and they use annotations to define endpoints which is really cool if you're designing an API
	0.076	0.79	0.134	0.4019	On pycharm. Is there a way to see what method will be called when a class inherit from two classes with the same method and no super?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Anyone familiar with `async/await` ?; I was wondering if it's relevant to use this construct in the context of DB operations; say DB insertion for example
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.6908	It's likely to be an overcomplication unless you truly know that you need it, and even then there are other optimisations to try first
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	yeah depends on how things are made.
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.4215	what kind of other optimisations ? (out of curiosity)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Depends on the application
	0.253	0.747	0.0	-0.6604	someone wrote an article a bit ago arguing that async for db isn't useful as they are so fast.
	0.101	0.899	0.0	-0.2263	Maybe you don't need an insert, maybe you can postpone it, maybe you can write to a cache, etc
	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.3919	but if all your app is async you might as well use it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah I see !
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> I expect you mean this one, by the author of SQLAlchemy - <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>
	0.248	0.752	0.0	-0.5106	The thing is I failed to find a concrete usage example for async/await
	0.135	0.865	0.0	-0.1419	I don't agree with all the conclusions, but broadly speaking it's right
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	even for a simple http request to an external service
	0.018	0.823	0.159	0.8683	If you have an application that needs to perform slow I/O operations as well as be responsive in some other way, then async operations may be what you need; e.g. I write video games, and I don't want to hang the whole game while we do a Quick Save, because we need to render every 16 or 32 milliseconds. So we do the save asynchronously
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.0772	<@Gwenda> you might want to read <@Signe> article <https://hackernoon.com/async-through-the-looking-glass-d69a0a88b661>
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.34	This sort of thing doesn't come up in Python that often, I'd argue
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.6369	this one might be best to start <https://hackernoon.com/asynchronous-python-45df84b82434>
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.5775	<@Gwenda> did you read it? Did you enjoy it? Did you learn anything?
	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.734	yup the first one; was particularly helpful in understanding how async vs sync works; I really liked the fast food vs bank analogy
	0.0	0.22	0.78	0.7964	awesome. Glad it helped
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.8675	I want to make python service for simple server monitoring ( is it available by IP or not ), so I need to make constant requests, I once in a minute. What is the best way to do it?    Or there is more sophisticated way?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	cronjob; make a standalone script, if possible; and have cron execute it once a minute
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	cron or celery, yeah
	0.087	0.798	0.115	0.1625	Not sure how to debug multi-threading code. The threads start off and abruptly print .; How do I resolve this issue?
	0.191	0.809	0.0	-0.6705	check kernel logs; might be a kernel out of memory issue, so your process has been killed; eg, `tail -f /var/log/kern.log`
	0.063	0.912	0.025	-0.4515	This is probably a dumb/novice question...but if I want to refactor a specific line in a ton of different python and/or template (html) files, how would I go about doing that? For example, if I wanted to find and replace one line with another multi-line block? I'm using `atom` as my IDE at the moment.
	0.0	0.837	0.163	0.6486	how many files are we talking about?; sublime has something similar, IIRC; but I always felt those can get out of hand really quick
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd use `sed` tbh, but your particular case my vary...
	0.053	0.947	0.0	-0.0772	under Find you can do replace in project; or sorry, under the menu it’s called “Find in Project”; and then it has a replace field
	0.0	0.641	0.359	0.4215	Oh that's nice, I don't use Atom
	0.0	0.776	0.224	0.6369	I do find it’s useful to “Find All” first to make sure you are actually aware of what will be changed
	0.04	0.768	0.192	0.6757	Nice - i'll check that out. I can see where you could screw up a lot really fast but I figure if it's one line it'd be safe.; Thanks all.
	0.097	0.818	0.085	-0.1027	and apply the change one at a time; reviewing the section beforehand, with the filename; I screwed up spectacularly once upon a time; fortunately, `git revert` saved my bacon, and nobody knew
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	actually looking at it, it may not do multiline replace, and doing a \n doesn’t seem to work
	0.151	0.849	0.0	-0.2411	because mixing that kind of changeset with existing changes is not cool
	0.0	0.969	0.031	0.1655	<@Dominick> To some extent I'm sure they do, just depends on what you prefer. Emacs isn't an IDE persay (though you can customize it to one) but you can do multi-line replace. Visual Studio has an add-on for it I've never tested... For Atom though jkelly's issue tells you the status there.
	0.0	0.94	0.06	0.3612	If you have a need for it that you think will take too much time in Atom, could always jump to something like `sed` that I mentioned to; Just depends on if learning the steps is faster at that time and such...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can also ask around in <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science>
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.6369	<@Suellen> are you of a different opinion? I would love to hear it...(spoiler: I don't ~really~ know async yet)
	0.0	0.663	0.337	0.7269	<@Enid>, my friend said that a good starting point may be something called “cosine similarity”
	0.0	0.854	0.146	0.4404	<@Enid> I think you should look at document summarization using recurrent neural networks, if you have a good training set
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Elroy> this looks really nice!; i'll give it a try with a new project later today

	0.0	0.908	0.092	0.6808	<@Frederica> It's better to ask a specific question than ask if people have knowledge in something. You are more likely to get an answer that way - either people know what you are talking about, they are interested enough to look it up, or the issue you have may be unrelated to a specific topic and more a general python issue

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	morning! anyone able to give me some advice on getting out of a while loop? python newbie here

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	write some condition in while ,eg:; 
	0.056	0.833	0.111	0.4215	maybe some context would help. the assignment is to recreate the game of “Pig”, human vs computer. player rolls a die, and can keep rolling as many times as they want, and then the other player rolls. first player to 50 wins.  if you roll a 6, your entire score for that round is 0. I’m work on the ask_yes_or_no method, which includes a prompt.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.6369	<@Chi> if you need to prompt, you can use something like `input("Enter yes or no")`
	0.089	0.892	0.02	-0.6769	the code is doing the opposite of what I want it to do.; not sure if it’s appropriate to post the entire thing here (it’s 100 lines); this is the prompt function ; when it’s nested in the computer_move method, and i run the program, if I type “no” it loops back and rolls the die again. if i type “yes” it just keeps asking “roll again?”
	0.052	0.875	0.073	0.0516	so, a while loop looks at the variable sequence and evaluates it to true or false.; you only set `roll_again` once in the loop, and that's when the input is that of 'Yes, I want to roll again'; you should set `roll_again` to be True` in the `if` and `False` in the `elif` block
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.5994	; when i enter “yes”, it just endlessly keeps asking “roll again?” when i enter “no”, it rolls the die
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then the issue is whatever else is within the conditionals that you're not posting here; you can post a code snippet by pressing the + at the side of the text entry and selecting `Code or Text Snippet`
	0.227	0.515	0.258	0.0772	<@Chi> I feel like something is missing here
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	ok. this is the whole program so far
	0.062	0.938	0.0	-0.2584	so with `ask_yes_or_no`, you're not returning a value there to use within the `while computer:` loop; so you should modify the `ask_yes_or_no` conditionals to  ; because a `return` inside a loop is an implicit break execution
	0.281	0.719	0.0	-0.5994	that doesn’t break the loop. it continues to roll the die
	0.342	0.658	0.0	-0.631	but I think you have your whole program structured wrong.

	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.5423	<@Meg> if you want to see some of the ones i’m using you can refer to this: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/tasks/calcs.py>  these are the calculations done by biglearn. they are on a particular schedule and all they do is check an endpoint for calculations. if there are calculations it may run the calcs and save the results and continue recursively or they will calculate and post their results.

	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.8271	<@Winnie> Depends what you mean by “quadratic”, but I assume you mean O(n squared) where you expected O(n)  It goes slowly because of all the string-copying going on: strings are immutable, so the expression `', ' + name` effectively means  “take a copy of `, `, then copy all of `name` after it”  And then `s += ', ' + name` means: “take a copy of `s`, then copy the chars in `', '` after it, then copy `name` after that”  As `s` gets longer, it is being copied much more often than needed. You’d be better off to use `join`, e.g. 
	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.2144	Yes, but it still takes a reasonably "significant" amount of time to compile, even when cached. 577ns just to emit the compiled re pattern from cache (752x faster than cold cache) ; which ends up roughly doubling the running time

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I only use virtualenv - I found virtualenvwrapper to be unnecessary when I looked at it. But, that was a a bit ago and I never went back and looked at virtualenvwrapper again.
	0.078	0.832	0.09	0.1154	I use virtualenv but sometimes read people recommending virtualenvwrapper when I read a blog post or something. virtualenv seems to fit my current needs but just wondering if I am missing out or something with virtualenvwrapper
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Wrapper for me; Don't need to provide the path to activate ; But that's about it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does it detect the correct env by the directory you are in?; or do you use `workon` <@Meg>
	0.132	0.786	0.082	-0.1336	For me, once I understood how `virtualenv` worked, I didn't want it abstracted away, so if that is the main incentive that's obvious where the difference in preference lies.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Just `workon env_name` for me 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’ve moved to pipenv mostly 
	0.035	0.857	0.108	0.5994	<@Beula> That one seems beefy, lots of features. Gotta check that out out a bit. One thing I do like about virtualenv is I usually throw my environments in project root and it helps me quickly see if the env is there or not and such. I can see myself accidentally creating a virtualenv when one already exists with the central place for all envs with virtualenvwrapper.

Is there a tool I can use to schedule this python3 script to be run every morning? Cron works, but only when I have a computer awake and set to run that script.... I'm new to this, and it's one of my first scripts so what are my other options? Any way I can set up this job in the Cloud for free?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is there scheduling on lambda, or does that rely on another service?
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.2382	Good point - I think it is technically a cloudwatch trigger, but it's not in front of me; I don't think that scheduling costs...

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Beula> for selenium that is
	0.069	0.893	0.038	-0.1425	I’m not entirely sure you can, it would be pretty hard to analyze any of the Ui interactions and which python code path it took. Instead you could just test views with various form data inputs (or whatever is appropriate) to make sure the view handles your input as expected. That depends on assuming that the framework does what it claims (which is fairly reasonable, IMO) and that a dev wired the pieces to the Ui properly (a little harder)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Last question of today (I hope); Is this being "as simple" as Python demands? ; I think I can reduce a line, what do you think?
	0.114	0.721	0.166	0.34	Sounds like a nice way to break your system's packages. Don't run pip as root.; Are you sure a release has been published on PyPI with that change? (Also, strictly speaking that python_version restriction is wrong, should be &lt; '3.4')
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.4019	Status active, so it may not be shipped yet (I think that would be accepted). So I may have mislead. You may need to do it in a setup.py and conditionally append the requirement on install 
	0.064	0.936	0.0	-0.438	<@Cynthia> I thought about that, but since the module doesn't say it support s python3.3, I left it.; <@Beula> I don't know how PyPi works. I looked in the tar and found requires.txt doesn't have the condition. Is that an admin specific thing that needs to be changed?

	0.0	0.712	0.288	0.7717	Oh, yeah, you'll need to change setup.py, I'm pretty sure. There's a couple of different suggested ways of doing that in various docs.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Oh, my guess is the issue you are seeing is related to not having a "virtual framebuffer" (e.g. the browser needs libs to paint out the screen to work)

I think it was something to do with the rendering of images or some kind of color issue, so what you’re saying might be that.; about 30 small CSV files. The results of webscraping that (as of now) can only be done from a local machine and not on my server, unfortunately.

	0.066	0.75	0.184	0.7227	this is an on going discussion in another group… but anyone care to help / chime in on what is happening? also have a stranger case that no one else has been able to reproduce… ; stranger case: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	python version?
	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.296	with no tab completion I'm able to recreate the second case; on v3.4
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think the tab completion and `help()` would have something in common: they would both require a “full” import of the module. (As would <@Antionette>’s example of accessing `urllib.parse`) Although that would suggest that the module in being “lazily” imported at first, which is not something I have heard of before
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’m on mac too, have tab completion
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	weird… i hit tab and it just jumps over; <@Antionette> any ideas on what is going on there?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Might be different readline libs. I seem to remember getting fussy about that a few months back
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, just read something about that; <@Earline> john’s example is really what were trying to figure out
	0.0	0.671	0.329	0.6597	Appreciate that, just thought it interesting that it can be reproduced another way
	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.7351	it matches the behavior described in <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodules> - notably that "For example, if package spam has a submodule foo, after importing spam.foo, spam will have an attribute foo which is bound to the submodule." - implying that if the submodule is not imported there will be no attribute
	0.103	0.897	0.0	-0.2411	not sure, it has to be that somehow trying to access the attribute causes the submodule to load
	0.044	0.956	0.0	-0.1779	yea; just weird that it only happens on some machines / for some people; its gotta be some sort of config somewhere, just trying to learn where that is / what it is exactly; what version / os are you on?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	3.4, ubuntu
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wonder if its a difference between readline and libedit?; but thats just for the cli though right?; shouldnt make a difference
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	not just for cli; meaning it happens whether in cli or from file
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i know i also cant reproduce on centos; and the other person that could was also on ubuntu; but the ubuntu i tested on couldn’t reproduce
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So it's only our guy and John Ferro that get it and they are on different versions?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea; both on ubuntu though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm on ubuntu 14.04
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Cannot reproduce in `3.4.3 on CentOS 6.4`, `3.7.a on OSX 10.12`, `3.5.0 on OSX 10.12`, `3.6.2 on OSX 10.11`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	k, he was on 16.04
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but he was python 3.5.1?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Mine is identical to his - it's probably the same repo, and I don't get it; Ubuntu 16.04 python3 package
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	unless he installed via download from the site?
	0.299	0.531	0.17	-0.3488	he seems pretty new to python also, so i doubt he did anything crazy
	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.0857	I told him to SO it, but if he doesn't want to I can
	0.111	0.758	0.131	0.101	Totally fair, just figure get some more eyes on it since no one seems to have anything
	0.139	0.861	0.0	-0.5499	<@Antionette> since you can reproduce it, can you try one more time, but after the error don’t call dir(urllib) just call urllib.parse again?
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	yeah tried that, it gets the attribute
	0.084	0.693	0.223	0.4215	ok; cool / still weird; and do you remember if you installed via package manager or from a download?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	package manager
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	question… does the same work with request, instead of parse
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	behaves the same as parse
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6249	ok; thanks
	0.0	0.56	0.44	0.6705	do you get True for this?; I'm assuming yes
	0.0	0.588	0.412	0.4215	umm…; wait; lol; typo; `False`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmmm
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but that should be the same
	0.153	0.688	0.159	0.0387	but then if you call `urllib.parse` it doesn't give the attribute error; but then it becomes true right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as parse wont load for you until after the AttributeError
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right
	0.075	0.726	0.198	0.5267	the original question on this… parse, request, etc… were actually loading on the AttributeError for urllib.foo; its like the interpreter throws the error then loads everything just to make sure
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.296	yeah I'm seeing the same behaviour; and just to double check, for you/the correct behviour is that you can access `urllib.parse` from the beginning?
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.296	no; 
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	ok so you have to explicitly import it
	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.4019	thats what most of us are seeing; dir(urllib) doesn’t change after the error
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	so it seems to be on any error; wait
	0.278	0.722	0.0	-0.4019	wth… import after error too? thats new; <@Mallie> ^
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does this happen for other modules, e.g. `logging` has a similar package structure to `urllib`, so what happens for ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hah - so it's the exception that triggers the import?
	0.2	0.8	0.0	-0.7184	no, he didn’t import urllib until after the error; <@Antionette> do that once more but call dir on urllib right after the error; lets see if it loads with the modules
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	without importing?
	0.369	0.631	0.0	-0.765	no, import urllib after error then call dir; see if parse is loaded before another error
	0.179	0.821	0.0	-0.2411	not sure if this is what you were looking for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea
	0.144	0.745	0.112	-0.1531	well that makes sense, otherwise it would have given the attribute error in the above code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Orpha> I'm here now
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	the question is why is any error importing it
	0.0	0.659	0.341	0.7351	yea; pretty much; there are a lot of why?‘s; haha; and i can’t reproduce that either
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have it written, just proofing it
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6249	awesome
	0.082	0.785	0.133	0.3612	<@Antionette> I hadn't gotten that far (I brought it up in another slack).  I'm also new to Python programming.  Is Exception the super to all errors
	0.0	0.723	0.277	0.3182	<@Antionette> curious are you able to do? 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kiersten> yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kiersten> 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That dude is basically the emperor of Python on SO
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Antionette> So basically, it's a namespace package and somewhere along the line something else imports the actual urllib.parse and then it works?
	0.0	0.68	0.32	0.5719	Yeah its look like this system exception hook is importing all modules
	0.23	0.77	0.0	-0.4576	So some sort of error reporting module? still digging into it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so apt-uninstall it and it should go away?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Seema> Can you `dpkg -l | grep python-problem-report` in your shell?
	0.315	0.558	0.127	-0.5719	My bad, you problem need to apt it; Do the `apt list`; Like john
	0.261	0.627	0.111	-0.6447	~btw, that’s a super specific problem for that dude on SO to sound so upset that you asked the question lol~ &lt; probably just reading it wrong
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.3401	now he's saying its this package; <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport>; he doesn't sound really upset
	0.12	0.88	0.0	-0.2617	So but I do have this installed, that's the weird thing; ; So what actually installs the hook?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mallie> what about the other… what john did
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't have python-problem-report installed
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I installed it and it doesn't happen
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Ohh I probably installed it to system; I am in a venv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	they even have slightly different ones
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mallie> do you have an /etc/default/apport; ?; <@Orpha> that's not listing installed version, just available
	0.636	0.364	0.0	-0.5423	ah; my bad
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	<@Antionette> yeah I do
	0.124	0.523	0.353	0.5423	<@Mallie> `enabled=1`?; if yes then its definitely getting stopped by venv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup
	0.062	0.938	0.0	-0.2617	Correct me if I'm wrong, but if urllib is a namespace package then there are never guarantees that urllib modules are imported, thus you would need to always `import urllib.parse` in your code.
	0.081	0.836	0.084	0.0258	^ thats what we all believe to be true; on some systems, it seems that you can throw an error and it will import everything; actually, wonder if it is everything
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Right, cause it triggers some package which then imports the modules
	0.0	0.709	0.291	0.6249	<@Seema> or <@Antionette> can you run ; <@Mallie> awesome, so answer found?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yeah
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.147	0.787	0.066	-0.4497	ok, so only with import of something (read urllib); but yea, so that package is just loading it when error happens
	0.096	0.769	0.135	0.1027	Yeah I took a peek at that. Definitely on my list of stuff to try.  Harassing the companies to release my data the right way has been one way I’ve tried it, too.
	0.183	0.733	0.084	-0.4019	john showed that it can be any error even before import which I find bizarre because it is preloading a solution to the import statement
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You learn something everyday
	0.11	0.71	0.181	0.2732	lol; yea, thats still weird, you should test that with that package too
	0.075	0.925	0.0	-0.296	the confusion is somewhat related to this I think <http://ncoghlan-devs-python-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-submodules-are-added-to-the-package-namespace-trap>; because the submodules are loaded to the global namespace; without the module itself getting loaded until import is called
	0.0	0.948	0.052	0.1901	anytime, learned something too.  Now I need to know how does it preload the answer to urllib import.; <@Antionette> Thank you.  Off to pickup kid but will consume when I return.  That's the magic I wanted.
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4926	thanks!

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what's the correct way of updating setuptools?
	0.368	0.632	0.0	-0.5423	Doesn't that require sudo which is bad?
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.6059	<@Winnie> well depends on where your packages are installed, it isn't bad if you're using it correctly; System packages are going to require root, virtualenv depends on those permissions
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and setuptools is a system package?
	0.07	0.856	0.074	0.0178	Well there may be a distro package for it, not sure, but by system package I meant global python packages (e.g. `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have one there and one in 3.6 of .local
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Those are for those different Python versions, that is where pip packages are installed when you install globally (default without being in a venv or using `-t` on pip install). Those directories are owned by root (see with `ls -l`)
	0.081	0.707	0.212	0.8442	<@Mallie> Hey Joshua, that's pretty much my question / answer right there. "I know of no particular reason you might want to avoid it".  Thanks; Everytime I see magic or whizbang, I want to know how the trick works and if there are any exceptions or gotchas.  Some of these one line yield statements are pretty slick and I get "suspicious", lol.
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.6705	Hah, that's fair. But generators do have a pretty straightforward behavior once you get used to them, so if you haven't read this yet, <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators>, do. Conceptually, the shorthand is the same as writing that sort of example class they have, it's just the interpreter is doing the state tracking and iterator behavior definition for you.

	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.8796	Currently working with `asyncio` after not touching it for a bit. I'm trying to clean up my code that I have for an application I'm building and make it a bit more object oriented and nicer looking, however, with the async task that's set to run I'm wondering what might be the best way to set it up. Should I instantiate the class that the background task is in then when everything is setup, run the task? Or have it outside of the class object?; This is a snippet
	0.073	0.777	0.15	0.3612	<@Myong> idk, does it need to be in the class?; If not, i feel its a bit better outside. 
	0.048	0.952	0.0	-0.3291	I actually fixed that all up; I'm now stuck with another small issue; Basically I'm using the `Discord` python library and they use decorators for making groups and accessing commands that you can use. The issue I'm running into is that they use a keyword in the `@&lt;decorator&gt;` that is not initialized; so it gives an error for it and I know why but I'm just attempting to figure it out

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what exactly are you trying to do ?; flattening inner lists in reverse ?
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.0772	l is `[[9, 10, 11], [6, 7, 8], [3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2]]` I want `[11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.581	0.419	0.7579	that's a O(N^2) solution, which is about as best as you'll get
	0.081	0.919	0.0	-0.296	the deque method will work fast what I'm asking is, doesn't python have any way of "stitching" lists together, to avoid iterating over every inner list?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Nope, and even if it did, it woluld still take the same amount of time; Also +1 to `[::-1]`, it’s faster than `reversed()`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	howso?; wait really?
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.296	<@Winnie>, what you're missing is how lists work in memory
	0.146	0.854	0.0	-0.2235	Because how else can you flatted internal lists without iterating them?; Yep; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`[::-1]` is just traversing in 1-step increments in reverse, whereas `reversed()` actually reverses the list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Carri> you're mixing `reversed()` with `.reverse()` method; 
	0.0	0.95	0.05	0.2263	`[[9, 10, 11], [6, 7, 8], [3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2]]` okay imagine if all the inner lists were linked lists then all I would have to do is connect 8 to 9, 5 to 6, and so forth
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`reversed()` does reverse a list, just yields a new object. `.reverse()` reverses in-place
	0.128	0.694	0.177	0.1615	~150 usecs simply don't worth to complicate the solution, imo; <@Carri> 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just swap `reversed(list)` with `list[::-1]`
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep, 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in new Python it returns an iterator, lots of legacy Python out there <@Collette>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.314	0.686	0.0	-0.6705	Oh, <@Patty> I made a mistake: `[::-11]` This is the corrected version: ; Even worse than `reversed`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> hmm maybe that changed 2 to 3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Winnie> how so? `10 -&gt; 11`, but you need `11 -&gt; 10` from your example output.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	@evan but they aren’t so it’s a moot point 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> I know, but what I'm asking is, is there someway to make them so
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Winnie> not without changing how lists fundamentally work
	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.1695	<@Joie> 2.4 hasn't been updated in almost 10 years, 2.2 in almost 15. It's not worth writing bckwards compatible code for these versions. Especially as you can normally simply upgrade to 2.7 without many (if any) code changes.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Winnie> mind answering my question?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> but a deque is a double ended linked list right?; <@Collette>
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.6369	Some are still on windows xp and RHEL 5. Does that mean we should always imply windows xp and RHEL 5 when talking about programming and such?; RHEL 4, even.
	0.041	0.775	0.183	0.7579	No, but there are consideration to make. If you're writing a library for other users, then you should consider the version boundaries you wish to support. If it's your own internal, then it's a non-issue
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	python3.5+; easy
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	[a:[9, 10, 11]:b, c:[6, 7, 8]:d, e:[3, 4, 5]:f, g:[0, 1, 2]:h] b is the end of the list, a then points to c, d then points to e... you never need to access the inner elements, just the head and tail of each list; <@Collette>
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.9153	Yep as <@Collette> says <@Carri> most people nowadays will only support 3+, 3.5+ especially with async features. A person writing a library should only have to consider what they personally need to support. It should the businesses/other peoples duties to fulfill the requirements of the software they ant to use, instead of forcing their requirements onto the provider; especially in open source where it is free; *when I say nowadays, I mean when starting a new library nowadays - not historical projects nowadays (although that looks to be starting to happen as well)
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	<@Winnie> yes deque is linked lists under the hood in c land
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> so I guess the real moot point is that it's n time anyway since you'd have to convert
	0.121	0.512	0.367	0.6976	<@Winnie> to be honest, if you care about such things you almost certainly picked wrong language
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> lists are just c arrays?
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.6369	I don’t think there is any reason not to try to squeeze time out of python, or to do exercises to show best practices in terms of timing
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But I'm the only who actually tries to measure these times
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I did, too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uh, slack threads
	0.204	0.577	0.219	0.0927	&gt;  if you care about such things you almost certainly picked wrong language I don't agree with this meme.
	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.504	<@Patty> do you really think your examples are correct? That lists of three elements are good inputs to measure performances of various algorithms?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> it was a quick answer while I was on the train
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette>  
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	<@Meg> my suggestion is always to use a real message broker, like rabbitmq
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm using rabbit as a broker; and redis as the backend
	0.0	0.959	0.041	0.1154	but apparently I'm overwhelming redis on the small instance I'm using; and there are still a large number of tasks waiting in the queue, since the workers aren't pickiung up; probably because of the redis issue
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.2732	&gt; MISCONF Redis is configured to save RDB snapshots, but is currently not able to persist on disk Disk IO is flying through the roof?
	0.061	0.771	0.168	0.4915	Yep.  Not surprising, since I have about 25 celery workers indexing web pages in solr; and since they're running as a chord, the results need to be saved
	0.0	0.79	0.21	0.7269	<@Winnie> your measurement is also incorrect. You should move `nl = deque()` to the body of the script from setup section; 25 workers? wow, that's huge
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	each task runs for about a half second to retrieve a web page, extract text with beautifuloup and insert into solr
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> why?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and I have about 10M plus pages to index; got about 15% of the way over the weekend before this cropped up
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.34	<@Winnie> because you're re-using a single instance of deque, it's shared between timeit invocations. But the point of `setup` is only to prepare data and things that should not affect the script itself (like imports); <@Meg> on a single box?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nope, three C4.Large instances; redis is running on a GP2 volume type, with 450/3000 IOPS
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> oh you're saying that I'm actually extending onto the previous queues made?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd simply disable RDB snapshots in that case; <@Winnie> correct
	0.0	0.966	0.034	0.0745	Hi, I'm using `celery` and have one specific periodic tasks that is running very often. I want to keep all the logging as it is, but only suppress logs for only this one specific task. How can I achieve that?

	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.6705	and use cases too; sure, an ORM doesn't cover every possibility, because SQL is pretty complex at times; and you should be familiar with the ORM library's downsides and use that to determine whether to use raw SQL or the library
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I've found that SQL alchemy ends up adding quite a lot of overhead; That's personal hearsay though; I prefer to use the native MySQL DB python library, even though it makes life harder sometimes; But I'm open to change

	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	<@Meg> What's it look like (if that is ok)?
	0.086	0.914	0.0	-0.4767	and that's _after_ I cleaned it up two years ago.  Before, it was far worse; at this point, I think its highly overcomplicated; and might be a case of lipstick on a pig to move forward without re-evaluating

	0.034	0.927	0.039	-0.4481	I work for a company that uses a lot of the python scientific packages. We use docker containers for running these packages currently. There are two issues I'm trying to figure out how to solve. First, what's the common methodology for storing/accessing large data locally? The large data is stored in the cloud - we are examining how that is stored right now, but it could be any back-end. `from data_loader import some_data_set`. would be the ideal line. My thought was to do a staged caching mechanism, e.g. if the data exists locally, use it. If it doesn't, pull it. Has anyone ever stumbled across a design pattern similar to this?  Second, since everything runs inside a docker container, would it really be so wrong to, on program start, if we are not running inside our docker image, start it and redirect everything to run inside it?; 3rd, does anyone have any lessons learned from running their own PyPI server privately?; Finally, does anyone think I ask too many questions?; <@Lawerence> Could you rephrase/expand a little; ?

	0.084	0.916	0.0	-0.296	That was my thought - and that was why I was wondering about running outside docker because inside docker, you got no idea how much is remaining
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with docker, you can symlink to external resources, correct?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You can mount resources externally; But as a container, it's not really aware of the system space remaining
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think there's some workarounds I can do there
	0.0	0.517	0.483	0.7564	so, seems like you’d have to ensure creation of the container
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Admittedly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then mount it; somewhat complex there

	0.05	0.897	0.053	0.0516	I'm a n00b and I was blindly reading this code ; Now I actually can say out loud what it does.  Of course, now I have a bunch of questions, lol; So I guess my next question is...list comprehension is preferable to dict because knowledge of key-value:pair is needed in dict and it isn't in list...?
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.2732	i wouldn’t say it is preferable. it depend on what you are doing. if you need a list of items a list comp is the way to go to create one.
	0.0	0.66	0.34	0.7351	okay, thanks.  (I think I need to read a lot more code); can the value in a key-value be a Class?
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.2144	yes; but the key cannot be a list, dict or set, or any mutable structure; so, you can use a tuple as a dict key
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the sounds messier, in general, than lists.  At least in this case.  Overall, I'm trying to grok why choices are made.
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.6369	basically, use a list or tuple where you'd prefer accessing an item by an index; use a dict if you would prefer accessing an item with a specific key; the first, you'd pretty much have to iterate over the structure and do comparisons before doing something; but with a dict, you can just do `item = dict_struct.get('key_name', None)` and get either the value for the key, or a `NoneType`
	0.0	0.658	0.342	0.6369	like getting a bunch of values from a particular column in a flat data set?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that's one way
	0.054	0.766	0.179	0.6369	I need help with this. Am using Postgres for DB…. I have an IntegerField in my models.py defined such as `number = models.IntegerField(default=0)`:  When I put in a number like 77370477795 in the form field, it throws error `Ensure this value is less than or equal to 2147483647`.
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.3612	<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-numeric.html>; that is the maximum size for postgres's integer datatype; if you're expecting numbers larger than that you will need to go to something like big int; which can store numbers up to `9223372036854775807`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I remember fixing this in Ruby and setting `limit: 8` which fixes as you described <@Antionette> Is there a way I could in Django? I meant how do I refactor this `number = models.IntegerField(default=0)` to handle that?

When I try to call it I see unexpected results.. 0.0% - However I am running the linux binary `stress` on 1 cpu for 60 seconds which consumes 100% cpu usage     is it possible psutil is not measuring usage across all cpu cores?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Cathern> ^^
	0.065	0.876	0.058	-0.128	Okay so I'm getting closer and closer to figuring out my issues here. I have a twitter API streamer running asynchronously alongside a discord bot, also running with async. Now, when I receive information from twitter, the stream is set to call a function. Now the function it calls is not set as async or anything like that. So my question is, when I call a synchronous function within an async function, is that no long asynchronous?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong> correct, you're only getting async behaviour when you yield
	0.068	0.836	0.096	0.3632	<@Marcie> Okay, now it seems that tweepy uses `Threading.py` for async. I am wondering if I can just throw the whole TweepyStreamer object into an `asyncio` loop to get async behavior and as for the two functions I have just mark those with `async def` and use await for return values?; This issue is basically I have a bot for Discord that has it's own loop so when it runs it's blocking; I need to get the stream to run while the the discord bot is also running; Now the bot event loop is already making use of `asyncio`. Do you think that simply by putting the streamer as a whole into an event loop will fix the problem?; Seems like if I want to run a blocking task I have to use run in executor; Okay thanks; Welp, didn't even realize they had webhooks so I think this shouldn't be too bad
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	i dont know how the interaction with Threading.py works with asyncio so i couldn't answer that, might be a good candidate for <#C07G5276F|async>

	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.34	so you’re using a connection pool with boto3 to fire off multiple calls?; boto3 is already using a connection pool
	0.052	0.846	0.102	0.2865	<@Meg>: this is how my code creates conn:  ; <@Meg>: i have added few msgs in _/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto3/resources/factory.py_ and the issue is coming from    and the exception coming because self.meta.data is None &amp; error string is : `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`

	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4215	<@Florene> Are you sharing a single boto3 resource across threads? The docs say not to do that: <http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-multiprocessing>
	0.055	0.945	0.0	-0.4019	<@Mallie>: actually i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations and the problem is occurring when i trigger multiple snapshots, wherein the single client-connection would be used to perform multiple operations..
	0.09	0.836	0.074	-0.2658	<@Florene> Yeah I mean I had to read an issue or two and google for a few min (they should be clearer about this) but I think it definitely isn't thread safe, so if you are using the same connection, it's not going to work out for you; Comment in github that Resource should be made thread safe (opinion) is from 2016 and is still open
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ohh you're telling this for google api library ?
	0.688	0.312	0.0	-0.296	no; boto3
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	oh this is how i create connection in my code:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is nothing to do with google api; its all how you’re using boto3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and i use self.ec2 at all places wherever and whenever needed; <@Mallie> Could you check whether what you've mentioned as not to be used is same as how i'm using/doing it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	all you’re showing there is how your instanciating the connection; not how you’re using it
	0.064	0.852	0.084	0.1531	Like <@Meg> said we aren't looking at that code, we are responding to &gt; when i fire multi-threaded calls using boto3 &gt; i'm getting boto3 error; And &gt; i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations; It is _not_ thread safe, you need to initialize your resource in each thread if you want to do multi-threaded stuff
	0.0	0.182	0.818	0.5423	Yeah sure: <https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/268>
	0.0	0.779	0.221	0.6597	thank you so much <@Mallie> <@Patty>  let me know if you think the same for google-library, thanks a ton _in advance_ ..
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uh, what?  this applies to the code, not deployment environment

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	google-library?; &gt;let me know if you think the same for google-library, thanks a ton _in advance_ ..
	0.155	0.845	0.0	-0.7964	i meant - i faces few problems on using `google-api-python-client` library &amp; i think, the problems that i'm facing is because of the library not being thread-safe so wanted your thoughts/confirmation on that one...; the problem i mentioned above, with stack let me know if you are not able to find that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Florene> <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/thread_safety>
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.296	yeah <@Patty> even now - i just found the same (y); Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage..
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It won’t be thread-safe given the library it’s built on. Every request will need to have a new httplib2 object
	0.188	0.77	0.042	-0.7753	&gt; Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage.. Don't, that is the wrong path here.; Those are not easy problems, you should adjust your program to use the library within the restriction of not being thread safe.
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.3527	oh should i not try to handle the issue ? i mean - say - i have multiple requests coming in &amp; then i should serve as much requests as possible and to achieve what i was thinking was to create session/connection whenever the request comes up &amp; processing would happen differently for each requests and each of them will have their own session/connection, right ?
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	basically, if you are using modules that aren’t thread safe, then do not multithread or process them
	0.0	0.914	0.086	0.1531	ok. but that also means - the request serving would be serial &amp; nothing can happen in parallel, right ?
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.7003	What <@Patty> is saying is don't use the _modules_ incorrectly. You are free to create multithreaded code, but don't use non-threadsafe components across threads.; Just create a new boto3 resource for each thread if that is what you want to do
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	I just want the third one that kind of separates the black dots and green dots (Matplotlib)

	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.6597	<@Junita> nope - plus I think that's what disabling `Exclude VCS Ignored Paths` does...causes it to look in every folder even if its in `.gitignore`
	0.137	0.863	0.0	-0.4019	I have some learning questions if someone has some time.  First, conceptually are there any problems with the template?
	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	no, that's correct for a list comp
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.6868	thanks, my question is about if temp_variable.my_question_here...; does Python know whether it's looking for a key or a field or a whatever after the period by inferring from the expression/a_callable  ?; I would imagine generally one would iterate over something searching for say a field in a class or in a value for a given key AND that Python looks at the "in" statement to determine how/what it is looking for.  Am I imagining correctly?
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	For the most part, Python doesn’t do dot accessors like JavaScript; So, for a dictionary, you would need to do `dict['key']`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm thinking that I keep seeing list to list comprehension and that it's more about what I've been seeing than what Python can do.; Continuing on the attribute part, is that why I can have a list of Class instances and iterate through the attributes of the Classes in the list?
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.296	Yeah because each `temp_variable` has a `my_question_here`; If it didn't, you'd get the exception
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.802	I don't think I'm crystal clear on what is an attribute vs field.  Time to dig into the docs.; Thanks for the help <@Frieda> <@Patty> <@Mallie>
	0.06	0.94	0.0	-0.2617	<@Seema> I could be wrong but I don't think Python ever explicitly refers to those as fields. Are you referring to fields in the Django sense of things? They define and heavily leverage that term.
	0.074	0.845	0.082	0.0767	In a class, there are a set of class "things", dunders, methods, class lists,etc.  I honestly don't have the confidence to say what the exact name is - in the terminology sense - of each of those things.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What's the proper name for self.__thing__ ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	classes only have two member types. attributes and methods; attributes are variables that are scoped to a class/instance; methods are functions that are scoped to a class/instance
	0.093	0.769	0.137	0.2023	are there any weird edge cases like a Class havinga  Class or is attributes and methods only?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a class having a class... I can't think of any way to do that that wouldn't make it an attribute
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.4404	attribute and method it is, thanks
	0.0	0.923	0.077	0.1901	you can't really have a nested class, like you could have a nested function; classes have inheritance, of course, but that's not the same

	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.631	Maybe old-style classes from py2 couldn't do it?; &gt; while _possible_, it's _uncommon_. Yeah, but I wish it was more common.
	0.077	0.707	0.216	0.3705	re: py2, maybe? re: wishing it was more common, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I kinda like things to be flatter
	0.0	0.799	0.201	0.794	Flat is indeed better than nested.. But it just looks so cute and simple!; I mean, you know what it does right away, without even having worked with nested classes before.
	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.2263	eh, you might be surprised on that "you know what it does right away" thing; i had a lot of students that didn't understand the class meta pattern
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can someone tell me whats the difference between json.dump and json.dumps

To avoid creating n number of `discovery.build` objects. ?
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.85	Hey guys, what technical approach would you recommend to the following situations: My web app has notifications. When a certain global thing is created (e.g new feature added), I want every user to receive a notification. I’m thinking of passing this message (that a new thing was created) to my `notifications` service, which would use the `Process` class to create a new process and run the function which would iterate through all the users there. Is this alright?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Tatum> I’d just use an async task queue to do that for you
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that’s what an async task queue is for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	celery has the concept of workers; which are independent processes that pick up jobs from a message queue, execute and then wait for another job to arrive
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.077	0.769	0.154	0.3612	please don’t make your own unless you _really_ know what you’re doing.  I had to clean up a big mess from a previous dev who tried doing exactly what you’re doing
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.2732	You’re completely right; I have celery set up as well; This is just another task
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Talk about over-engineering
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	now, you’d just have to have your client-side do a poll on an interval to check for notifications
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.4404	Thanks for clearing this up, I had a hunch it wasn’t the right approach
	0.176	0.662	0.162	-0.0516	Yeah that’s the thing right? Handling errors and reporting back/retrying adequately
	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.25	_much_ more reliable, and you’ve already passed the third hurdle; exactly; that’s the difference between a toy project and something that’s production-ready: how it handles things you don’t expect; so, one area I’m unclear on; are you using polling on the client to check for updates?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the client as in who?; the one spawning the task?
	0.117	0.745	0.138	0.1027	no. you have a web app, so I assume its consuming an API; both browser and mobile capable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh that’s a whole other separate thing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how are you looking for updates in that?; because you can have the notifications in the server
	0.0	0.723	0.277	0.3182	there’s a specific notifications server which accepts websockets
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it is connected to the main app through RabbitMQ; and is listening for notifications, once it receives one it checks if the recipient is connected and if he is - he receives a notif
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	good idea; and you’ve thought it through
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2732	so what the celery task would do is create the `Notification` object and maybe send a message through rabbitmq
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you using rabbit as the backend for celery?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ouch…
	0.237	0.763	0.0	-0.4767	they’re two separate instances though, methinks; why, whats wrong with that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I really wouldn’t reccommend it; not advised in the docs
	0.0	0.208	0.792	0.5859	wow really
	0.0	0.546	0.454	0.3597	redis is more stable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’ll need to revisit them, then; This started out as a hackathon project and my initial idea was to just get celery working
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.2732	I used rabbit as both the broker and backend in the first iteration; what ended up happening, it was storing the results in memory, as well as the jobs
	0.102	0.8	0.098	-0.0258	and eventually everything clogged up so the workers weren’t picking up new jobs; yep, and server crashed, everything was lost
	0.0	0.83	0.17	0.7647	wow, how is that scenario not handled; it’s not that hard to predict it clogging up and eating all the memory, wonder why Celery hasn’t done anything about it; AFAIA RabbitMQ has something like durable queues which store the data ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://denibertovic.com/posts/celery-best-practices/>; maybe they have, with 4.x; I’mm using 3.1.x
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, I moved to redis for result storage; since that’s basically what its built for: fast, concurrent key-value storage
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wait, result storage?; As in the results of a task?
	0.171	0.62	0.209	0.128	no, return of task; eg, task state, return values, etc
	0.0	0.973	0.027	0.1027	gotcha.  I use redis for that, mainly because there are alot of short-term tasks to execute; if I were to use that, the writes to db would be significant; I do have tasks that write to the database; but they do a query and update inside the task, and that’s for the more infrequent, longer-running tasks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mine are long-running ish; might be minutes too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	gotcha

	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.9187	I want to take a screenshot of whole screen in python which is doable(feasible) to me. But if i want to take screenshot of a desired clipped area like the picture shown below means first of all, user should select(clip) a region using mouse pointer and then take screenshot of that area. So i want to say that how to clip a portion of an image in a clipboard?   NOTE: I have found some packages like "clipboard" and "pyperclip" but i couldn't understand how to clip an image? Help me  I got a code but it shows to clip only text. What modifications should be made in it to clip a desired area of an image.           import clipboard     clipboard.copy("abc")      text = clipboard.paste()      print(text); answer please
	0.0	0.759	0.241	0.8779	<@Lemuel> its a very inactive time of day, its generally best to post a question and if someone who can help is around they'll give an answer. some googling around shows some solutions here if youd like to take a look <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3895732/selecting-area-of-the-screen-with-python>

	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.2846	you've explained very little in your question.; just "I'm trying to do this, and failed"  but nothing on _what_ you've tried

	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.3182	<@Lemuel> you're going to have to stick to reading more documentation, there's quite a lot of work to capture a region of screen including finding the OS specific solution that isn't really a simple question to answer

	0.0	0.621	0.379	0.6908	something like the solutions linked in the stackoverflow are appropriate, things like PIL <http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/ImageGrab.html>
	0.089	0.826	0.085	-0.2846	dear, i have implemented screenshot of whole screen.; yeah, here they have given a function grabclipboard() but the problem is, how to get the portion of an image in clipboard after which i will apply the grabclipboard() function. Right
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	ahh, easiest way for that is with gtk's functions gtk.Clipboard.set_image <https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/class-gtkclipboard.html#method-gtkclipboard--set-image>
	0.183	0.566	0.252	0.09	thanks but can you please give me a example.; now you got the actual problem.

	0.076	0.867	0.057	-0.2846	we'll give you general guidance with broad problems, like you've described; its your job to incorporate feedback and your own searches to get _something_; and then you can come back with specific issues; like "I've tried X, but its not working and I'm getting Y.

	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.2023	I do, it's a cultural thing and I accept that; but I also need to explain to you that these are innapropriate things to say, especially on an English speaking forum

	0.037	0.963	0.0	-0.1531	In my opinion there is no correct replacement, you simply do not need to use any pronouns. simply "i have explained the question, did nothing else" is enough; The closest correlate in english would be Sir/Ma'm, but neither are appropriate in this context

	0.06	0.812	0.128	0.9735	My answer is not what you are looking for; And it is not that I do not want respect, it is that English naturally uses a respectful tone (e.g. You is the respectful form of the 2nd person); We dropped the less respectful stuff centuries ago; <@Lemuel> There is a link at the top of this channel: <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>  I suggest you read it.  I understand you would like us to help you solve this problem, and we would love to help you. As a result each of us has a duty.  Your duty is to do as much research and work as is possible into the problem area - to really try to understand it and attempt more solutions than simply `clipboard.copy("abc")`.  You need to gain a real understanding for the problem you are facing and come up with a plan or two to tackle it - and then attempt those plans. Once you have done that, if you still have issues, you should come to us. Explain what you've tried and, as <@Meg> explained, tell us what roadblock you've hit and why you think you've hit it.  Our duty then is to try and point you in the direction of resources which can help you with the problem - or to explain bugs you've introduced that we can see (because you should share your code so we can see).  If you do not have a coherent or complete plan, or lack the understanding required - we point you in the direction of resources to help you. This is what we have done so far.  What we will not do is solve your issues for you. Firstly because you will not learn as a programmer, your own progression will suffer, and we would not have really helped you in the long term. Secondly, because you are not paying us and we do not have time to solve everyones issues - this is not a crowdsourced development platform.; You have asked for help from us, which is fine. We have offered suggestions to help you help yourself.; Show us you have taken that on board and have tried instead of dismissing it; If you feel you have spent too much time on the problem, take a break and come back another time when you feel ready to try again.
	0.0	0.964	0.036	0.4291	Saw this function in a library I use. Curious as to what exactly happens here.    obj is having it's __class__ changed to a new class. What happens when this line is executed? Is it something along the lines of `obj = NewClass()` and in the __init__ will run? Would the init be skipped since this doesn't seem to be instantiating a new instance of an object?; `ssh_dispatcher` returns reference to a class in the above code, not an instance of the class.
	0.0	0.937	0.063	0.5709	<@Meghan> It simply changes what `__class__` is, I am quite certain the `__init__` would not be run, since, as you correctly pointed out, this happens when an instance is created.; My guess is that `obj.session_preparation()` sets whatever instance properties are needed that differentiates this class from the original class and the idea is to reduce overhead (so rather than instantiating a new object with all of the data that is needed from this object).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I guess I had not imagined that being a thing. May have to give it a try some time.
	0.0	0.793	0.207	0.6124	seems like it would be a delicate task to make sure `obj.session_preparation()` does everything right. Presumably the old and new classes are expected to be _quite_ similar
	0.067	0.778	0.156	0.4767	Yeah, everything is inherited from one class.; It looks like the session_preparation method does stuff like disabling paging and entering into enable mode.; If the class had instance variables that were different i guess they would include them in that method.
	0.402	0.54	0.058	-0.8873	Good evening guys, has anyone ever had the weird problem that execution stops while instantiating an object but throws no errors?; It's killing me:
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.3818	I would guess something in that object is blocking indefinitely or has an infinite loop.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	As far as I can see it doesn't

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'll remove the try/except andsee if it shows me something; I'm not passing it though
	0.152	0.443	0.405	0.6116	Yeah that would be best - not good to except Exception

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Jupyter yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If the Exception were hitting there though it'd be raised - you are saying Jupyter is suppressing it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Never tried jupyter
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But it also behaves in the same way on pycharm; Have both
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is Jupyter calling that function itself, or is another function calling it?
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	But in pycharm the code analysis looks like this:
	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.4173	(I've not used Jupyter, so I'm clueless on how it works.)
	0.718	0.282	0.0	-0.6249	orange = warning, red = error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Jum ...
	0.434	0.566	0.0	-0.5574	and a lot of the warnings are potential errors
	0.0	0.804	0.196	0.296	Yeah, that red is stuff that will break your code.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Mine doesn't show anything.
	0.0	0.764	0.236	0.2878	so might be worth double checking your code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Let me see if I can configure it to show the analysis.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Does Jupyter include an editor? I didn't realize that.
	0.151	0.849	0.0	-0.5499	I've got to go, but I really think the calling function is ignoring the raised exception, either with suppress or a blanket try/except.
	0.068	0.794	0.138	0.428	Yup, is not very good but I like it to scratch stuff and then I try to refactor it in Pycharm; I think this is it:
	0.0	0.82	0.18	0.4329	Does it have a hook for like pyflakes or anything? Any kind of syntax checking?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Even if it's not it it's still an issue
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I'll test two things:; exception being swallowed somehow; perhaps those lines trigger the exception; that's why when I remove set year, day, month execution continues until next assignment
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Marcie> Did you ever figure it out?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kym> What is the output of `import sys; sys.excepthook`?; In the interpreter where this is happening of course, so however you make that happen in a Jupyter notebook.
	0.028	0.84	0.132	0.8439	&gt;If finally is present, it specifies a ‘cleanup’ handler. The try clause is executed, including any except and else clauses. If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved. The finally clause is executed. If there is a saved exception, it is re-raised at the end of the finally clause. If the finally clause raises another exception or executes a return or break statement, the saved exception is discarded; Nice one!; <https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement>
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	interesting find
	0.165	0.488	0.348	0.4588	seems like return inside of finally should be discouraged pretty broadly
	0.0	0.982	0.018	0.2144	Yes, but the docu doesn't say anything.; I'm using python2; <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html>; the only mention of return is the following:; "A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause (or it has occurred in an except or else clause), it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed. The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement. A more complicated example:"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I linked to the reference docs, that's where the quote comes from
	0.538	0.462	0.0	-0.5423	Oh, I did. My bad.
	0.068	0.822	0.11	0.296	I mean it's pretty logical it's going to discard one if a second exception is raised in the finally; I don't really see how they could have done different
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the 3 docs have it in there also; about a page down <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally>; 
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	Good find <@Shavonda>; Bu; But I still believe it should be mentioned in /tutorial/errors
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	I agree with you
	0.057	0.901	0.042	-0.469	So, the novel has concluded :3  try: ... except Exception as e: raise(e) finally: curs.connection.commit() curs.connection.close() return len(root.getchildren())  So:  1. A finally clause is always executed **before** leaving the try statement, - so execution looks like so: try&gt;finally&gt;except 2. whether an exception has occurred or not - in this case an exception occurred in the try block 3. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause - in this case the exception wasn't handled by the except clause because there was a finally 4. it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed - but the finally clause returns, so we leave context and never come back to execute the except block; Jum ... what's the preferred way to suggest changes to the docu?; Pull request?
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.6597	Well tutorial is kinda more "things you should do or most people do do", the reference should be complete; But, a fun gotcha I'll give you that
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.2617	it's still try &gt; except &gt; finally; but if you have ; the `raise (e)` doesn't do anything, because the finally runs after it, discarding the exception
	0.046	0.954	0.0	-0.1779	or at least, that's the way it looks to me; really the more I think about this, the more I think it should be a warning to put return inside finally, but maybe there's a corner case where it's appropriate
	0.021	0.934	0.045	0.4836	I agree, <@Sirena>; Regarding the second one I'd still say it's try&gt;except&gt;finally; It says, finally is always executed after try; Otherwise it wouldn't work; I mean, the purpose of finally is to be executed before execution is terminated; and this happens after the raise; no?; Hm ...; What if we do a raise instead of print('two'); ?; Does print('three') happen before th; the raise or after? I think it makes a difference, let me try.; line 7 is never executed; even without the return; which makes sense ... because that's what raise is for; Hm ... the sequence is indeed: try &gt; except &gt; finally The only problem was that although raise triggered an exception and the exception was saved, return led to it being discarded.; Regarding your second statement

	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.6369	best README ever; Also <@Seema> the workflow and concepts of git are going to be the same whether they are CLI or in PyCharm
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> I get that but the layer of abstraction is a button or interface I would be "learning" and I can come back to the later (or not).  The tutorials all have that click here, click there on how to use git in PyCharm.
	0.1	0.843	0.057	-0.3744	It’s just clicks vs. commands. A lot of the naming overlaps as well. In my experience most people get frustrated and move to CLI, which is used more, and has a lot more resources online
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so...you're suggesting that learning git through PyCharm will not be "noisy"?
	0.03	0.827	0.143	0.8625	some things are harder to do than with CLI. personally what i’ve seen from my students was ditching something in a program for CLI so that they are interacting with git a bit more “closely” and it lends to better understanding/learning. It also makes things difficult if you are on a machine without PyCharm; I’ve found that CLI + a GUI tool like SourceTree (if you are a visual person and like to see state of a repo that way) works best
	0.0	0.403	0.597	0.7506	yeah, a GUI tool of some kind is important
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	depends on the learner and the goals. some people go into SourceTree and then lean on it for a longgg time
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think git ships with a tool called `gitk` which will provide a minimal GUI; at least in most common packages for git
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	different packages
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't use a GUI for git day-to-day, and the only ones I ever have were github/gitlab, but everyone is different
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.4767	<@Seema>, I wrote a Git tutorial for me and my friends a while ago. I found most of the documentation online to shallow or to deep. Perhaps it resonates with you: <https://sentheon.com/blog/easy-git-guide-and-reference-for-the-busy.html>
	0.056	0.848	0.095	0.4512	So I'm falling victim to copying code from SO without understanding how it works. I have this ranking function:    I have 1,013 key, value pairs in my dictionary. 698 of them have a value of 100 so they should all be ranked #1, then the next non-100 value should be ranked 699. Instead, they're all ranked 698th. Any idea how to get the starting rank at #1 when they're all the same?
	0.077	0.923	0.0	-0.3939	I'm confused, are you re-sorting the dictionary every time you ask for one of its entries?; if you pick 3 entries from your dictionary, what output are you expecting, and what are you getting?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when I run that, I get 1,1,1,4
	0.0	0.731	0.269	0.8655	<@Sirena> I'm very glad you said that cause I read through the code like 3 times and thought it looked like it was working as wanted; because the rank only updates after a change in value
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.1027	It's strange - it actually works for most of my dicts, but on a couple it gives the behavior I described.
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4019	for the ones where it doesn't work are the values classes instead of a simple data type?
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.6174	I am wondering, does Wheel specification provide any security for binaries? how can we be certain that the compiled extension hosted on Pypi is really compiled from that src that author states? (besides compiling by ourserves and checking diff)?
	0.0	0.689	0.311	0.204	I'm almost certain it doesn't
	0.052	0.836	0.111	0.686	can you print an exact example of one of the dicts that doesn't work?; this is tricky, nothing stands out to me as why that would be. python version?; maybe, but it looks like there are values less than 100 (`"13801": 96.0`) so I'm not sure what the expected behavior is; I'm assuming if 100 is the first number though right?; do you know what 100 should be in your example

	0.157	0.796	0.047	-0.836	Hello, everyone.; I have some problem with hooking of git.; I think, this is the problem with sys.argv[1:4]; There is no value in sys.argv[1:4]; When i catch the exception, it goes to apport_python_hook.py .; finally:         # resume original processing to get the default behaviour,         # but do not trigger an AttributeError on interpreter shutdown.         if sys:             sys.__excepthook__(exc_type, exc_obj, exc_tb); Finally, goes to here and dead, does not work...

	0.375	0.625	0.0	-0.8402	Thing is, I'm not running webpack at the moment.; I fail to see what's wrong with the path. =/
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	possible it's in your browser cache or something ?
	0.06	0.94	0.0	-0.4854	Woahhhh I just notice something weird, Is there a difference between 127.0.0.1 and localhost?; <@Ciera> I was thinking that could be the case.  localhost:5000 seems to be serving cached files. The flask server only logs a couple requests but chrome sees many, whereas if I point my browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 then the flask logs show that all files are being uploaded and I am now able to see my missing bundle.js (as expected).
	0.351	0.649	0.0	-0.5848	I still fail to see why `localhost:5000 != 127.0.0.1:5000`
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.5023	it's the same but chrome cache might handle it like two different address; so a cache for localhost and a different one for 127.0.0.1
	0.0	0.612	0.388	0.368	;D it happens to everyone
	0.04	0.96	0.0	-0.2144	Onto the next question. I'm getting this non-deterministic problem where sometimes I get a file uploaded more than once. I'm thinking that could be a gunicorn thing, but I'm not certain.; Actually, I revoke this question until I noodle around a bit. I'll come back to it later if it persists.
	0.029	0.858	0.112	0.6846	<@Kayce> in addition, localhost allows you to have some security exceptions, like when using the browser geolocation api and iframes… at least with chrome.  Not sure if they still apply to `127.0.0.1` or in other browsers.  That’ll let you do some dev work with those two, without requiring SSL in the former and dealing with lots of special cases with the latter
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.6249	i have a csv file with ~2million rows (1.5gb) and need to process its contents - e. g. read out column 6 entry of each row and store it in a `dict` or `set` - anybody has ideas for an efficient solution?   (i am running on latest mac, 16gb, python 2.7)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I believe the stdlib csvreader use a generator so you can use that and process it line by line; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444679/reading-a-huge-csv-file>
	0.0	0.913	0.087	0.4404	<@Aimee> any chance you can import to a database and use python to retrieve the data from there?; that would allow you to use the db for faster queries, analysis and such, without having to re-read and import the data upon each program execution
	0.045	0.821	0.134	0.2647	db is definitively a better idea. If you use correctly generator is the number of rows shouldn't matter; but it can be slow
	0.0	0.705	0.295	0.4466	Oof, OK. Then I'd try out <@Ciera>'s suggestion
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.2732	well you can still insert it in a db the first time and afterwards use the db
	0.0	0.966	0.034	0.1027	<@Ciera> i have to admit i do not have that much experience working with generators - especially at that scale.; <@Ciera> <@Meg> i normally tend to use google drive and read files through the google api but this file is too large for google drive
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	basically, a generator will only pop off one row at a time, which is called `yield`ing; that way it doesn’t have to hold the whole CSV in memory
	0.0	0.785	0.215	0.6369	<@Patty> thank you. yes, i totally understand the concept of generator functions. just havent written and worked with many of them myself
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4588	if all you want is the unique values in column 6 then `cut | sort | uniq` would generally be the quickest way
	0.052	0.866	0.082	0.09	sounds like a good learning experience for you.  but don’t forget, instanciating that many objects will have an impact on your memory.  In addition, any kind of analysis done will be dependent on how python runs on your system; are you using pandas?
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.2144	<@Meg> yes, i am using pandas. but not in that context yet.
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.8225	ok, because that would save time; it has a pretty bulletproof csv import functionality; so if you’re doing searching, analysis, etc, I’d look into that rather than rolling your own code
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.4939	So I'm on a sortof low-urgency search for a dev-friendly widget kit in python that is available for linux. My preference is for a.) minimal installation headaches and dependencies and b.) availability on RHEL6/CentOS6. Anyone have a suggestion or care to weigh in on the pros and cons? I'm currently using PyQt4 (which I think is a dependency headache) on one project and pygtk on another
	0.0	0.392	0.608	0.7351	<@Kym> Wonderful Git Guide, thank you
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you pass a class into a subclass and have it keep all previous properties?
	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.3182	sure, define class properties in `__init__`; unless the subclass overwrites them, you’ll have the superclass properties the same
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.3612	like; I have a function that generates a superclass; is it possible to pass that superclass into the subclass instead or repeating the function and adding more elements?
	0.0	0.961	0.039	0.0772	uhh, generates a superclass?; I think you’re mixing up OOP basics.; in your init of the subclass, have it take in properties you want set.; superclass should have fields already set via its own init
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in B, define an `__init__`; that will call `super(A, self).__init__()` with the required properties
	0.082	0.641	0.278	0.7579	I'm a bit confused; what does passing A into super do?; because the code I'm working on passes B into super (in the B class)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; that’s for python3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	 that's the code I'm working with
	0.045	0.838	0.117	0.6041	ok, so B is a subclass of A; and you’re already instanciating properties that B inherits from A; in addition, if you have a method defined in A that’s not replicated in B, its still accessible from B; eg,     is perfectly valid; so, unless I’m missing something here, you already have everything you need
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right; I understand the OOP; but I'm trying to figure out the correct syntax; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what is make_A?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just do `B(data)`
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.0772	if you just want an A object, `make_A(data)` should instead just be `A(data)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	make_A parses a json and takes out the appropriate fields to put in the args
	0.019	0.902	0.079	0.1779	if you want a B object that inherits A, just do B(data) and in your B.__init__(), include whatever funky manipulations you want to the vars inherited from A; yah, so you probably want ; there is a design pattern called a 'factory pattern' where functions return instances of objects, but I don't get the sense that is what you want in this case (I could be wrong)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you normally construct your objects from something other than json?
	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.3612	so I guess what I was asking is, can you pass the initliasations of a class to a subclass and have it inherit them maybe something like 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	factories are something loosely along the lines of 
	0.17	0.83	0.0	-0.6956	I think this repo does both; <https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/blob/master/fbchat/graphql.py#L106> if you're intrested; I'm adding a "graphql_to_room" function, where it's a copy of the above but instead with extra fields and idk, it just felt wrong
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.4269	it looks more like it's accepting a GraphQL object and returning a Group object, but the GraphQL object is mostly just a blob of query data, so it could contain all sorts of things; so this is very similar to a factory, but it uses a bunch of functions rather than a class to determine which object to return; if you have a graphql blob of 'room' data, then adding a graphql_to_room function would make sense, just mimic what's in most of these other functions
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.1531	yeah; but instead of reapating code, could I get the graphql group function to do some of the work for me?
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.2732	well, a room is just a group with some extra things, so it inherits from it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but assuming a room is not a group with additions, and a group is not a room with additions, it's probably most sensible to write a separate independent function; ah; then yah
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	what does your `class Room:` look like?
	0.0	0.718	0.282	0.2411	not to be confused with `classroom`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then what does your graphql room query look like?; I think it's likely that you'll not be able to reuse graphql_to_group because it's returning a Group object from a group query, and you're going to have to write a new query for a room object
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://github.com/ekohilas/fbchat/blob/rooms/fbchat/graphql.py#L121>
	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.5023	and I don't know the ins and outs of how that all works, but it seems like the graphql queries don't exactly have inheritance
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	my idea is that I call the data on the graphql_room and then just unpack it's data into Room()?
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.1901	yeah, I see why you might want to have some code reuse, and I suppose it's a little bit of a style question, but I think it will end up less readable
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.128	at times, it can be a tough balancing act between competing priorities
	0.105	0.839	0.056	-0.3612	you might get by with something like ; but it's still going to be a lot of similar code duplicated; alternately, you could modify your Room.__init() to include a Group argument
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	isn't there a way to get the fields from a group and just put them into a room as **kwargs
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.6917	that would probably work too, I think; as long as you don't reuse any argument names in both classes or anything surprising like that

	0.109	0.833	0.058	-0.5267	no, your program doesn't wait for threads (you must use `thread.join()` for this); but if your program doesn't have anything else to do, i.e. you launch threads and then it's the end of the program, it won't close until threads are finished; will block until `t` is finished, because a program is only allowed to exit when all non-daemon threads are finished too ; Will not block and will happily exit even when `t` is doing something

	0.025	0.875	0.1	0.8415	like look for import errors for example; My challenge is as follows; I have a package that relies on many very different 3rd party modules, in essence - we are building API wrappers, then implementing actions e.g. do something with the API wrapper; some are py2, some are py3; some of these packages don’t work in 2 and 3; so our module, which has all these classes which are wrappers around APIs; get’s picky depending on py2 or 3; so we inadvertently break our import statements; always at the worst time; so - I guess I’m asking how to catch this earlier with testing; I’m fully aware there is probably a better solution to my py2-py3 challenges, and we’ve talk about having a separate package/repo for py2 and py3 code, but I’d prefer not it if possible, but since we aren’t just a small module, we are a framework of integrations, it creates these import challenges that I’m admittedly not an expert on; <@Frieda> did help or make my question more ambigious
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm. you couldn't just figure out which one break on which version and nest their imports under a check against `sys.version_info`?

	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.34	<@Johnette> I don't get, say, this line `keys  = dict(d)['Key']`; why convert `d` to a dict to get a key value? you could just do `keys = d['Key']`; `defaultdict`s are still dicts

	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.2926	Just was reviewing some list operator and gave it a whirl, and was not expecting that result.; Take away lesson: Use max on list with caution!; Or experiment a bit to get a more solid understanding
	0.074	0.926	0.0	-0.2484	max on a list take the max of the list; it depends what the list is made of; it's especially weird when you start to mix type

	0.0	0.74	0.26	0.8591	thanks <@Collette>, but I have managed to convert PDF to Text but the whole process of ocnverting invoice to data has been challenging. Anything on that front would be great :+1:
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.3182	<@Malorie> every invoice will be different as many places don't format them the same. So it's going to have to be a unique solution to your invoices
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Vada> there is a library called invoice2data; but i am unable to correctly use it
	0.062	0.875	0.063	-0.437	sure; so i used PDFMiner as the library depends on pdf2text which wasnt working for some reason; post using PDFMiner, i have been able to extract pdf info in text format; then i modified the library a little bit to accept text data; all that is fine; the library expects me to write a yaml template for a particular companys invoice; all invoice are matched based on keywords in yaml file; and information is extracted using regex in yaml file; i am attaching an example; but the parsing doesnt happen and it gives an error; above is yaml file created by me; similar to one expected by them; still parsing error shows up
	0.077	0.923	0.0	-0.3244	I am trying to write a lambda function, to update an ordered dict if len is not 0.; Its giving me a syntax error.; `eq_x = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) `
	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.5255	how do you use `eq_x`?; you also can't use if in a lambda; actually that is wrong you can do this; `a = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) else None`
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	Thanks <@Vada>
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	If you're assigning a lambda to a variable right away, you'd better write a regular function
	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.5106	<@Desire> while this does solve the issue, I agree with <@Collette>, lambdas are not for everyday constant use. You should define a function if possible - not a lambda.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Desire> a lambda is an anonymous function; what you’e doing here is essentially making a named function with a lambda, which is bypassing what it is intended for

	0.028	0.936	0.036	0.1474	Not super familiar with tkinter so this might be off, but fill=X makes the widget as wide as its parent, which in this case is the header, but you are not also filling the header to be as wide as its parent (root).  If you wanted to label to take up the full space of the main frame you might also have to set fill=X for the header packing as well

	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.4019	there are applications that can help you read pdfs. mayan-edms is an electronic document management system and does ocr on any documents that it imports. you can then use its api to extract data.; <https://www.mayan-edms.com/>; btw, it’s a django app.; the web api uses DRF and swagger.
	0.071	0.929	0.0	-0.267	dont need it super simple; but not so complex that i would rather write my own package; <@Johana>  so i need to figure out how to run electronic document management
	0.104	0.835	0.062	-0.4404	ok so then you would need to deploy mayan-edms. you could use docker, a vps, an old laptop, or install it locally.; you give it a folder to watch and then you drop files in and it will suck them up and create a bunch of metadata you can read about the file.; i keep no paper documents at home. i use mayan-edms to manage all my documents.
	0.145	0.629	0.226	0.0774	<@Johana> stuff like that look interesting but it seems so hard to maintain
	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.4215	i run the server on an old laptop and haven’t looked at it since lol.
	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.6249	I'm trying to setup API integrations tests using Runscope. Unfortunately, I need file upload for this. I've found info that  (<https://www.runscope.com/support/kb/multipart-file-uploads>) I'm having trouble to construct this `raw multipart-formatted body`.; does anybody have an idea how it should look?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirian> I would make a valid post to that api; with the browser dev tools open; see what data goes out, and how its formatted; that would give you clues how to do it in your integration tests
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.081	0.747	0.172	0.4215	Had never heard of mayan-edms, that does look nice. Might just set that up. <@Johana> is it difficult to set up? Looks like just a docker image.
	0.049	0.951	0.0	-0.1901	i installed it locally on an old laptop and it wasn’t difficult but I have deployed django apps before.; if you check the ecosystem you will see an ansible playbook i made.; with docker it should be a breeze.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is there an Android app where I can take a pic while I'm out on my phone and have it automatically put into the system?
	0.068	0.892	0.04	-0.2263	i have no idea.; its for documents so you could move the document from your phone to a folder that mayan is watching.; i don’t think you want to use it for photo management.
	0.091	0.859	0.05	-0.296	Not for photo management, but using phone as alternative to scanner while out. Say if I drop off a package at UPS and I want the receipt in the system.
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.1154	but if you took a photo of a document then i would do that; yea i know what you meant. i was just saying that you probably don’t want it watching for every photo.
	0.0	0.901	0.099	0.296	Oh, yeah, not that. I was thinking an app that would take the photo and upload. Not scan all of my photos.
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.2732	i already use bittorrent sync so i would probably use that.; you could create a folder that bitttorrent sync is keeping up to date that mayan is watching.
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	Yeah, that would work.

	0.048	0.952	0.0	-0.2263	Hi guys, bit stuck here. Trying to append user input integers into an empty list, and for the program to tell me if the numbers 1,2,3 are in that list. Here’s my code:    The program is running, but I think it’s not appending to A, as checking if control is in A for input (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) outputs `no`
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.6369	so you have a list, and you want to see if a value from that list exists in another list?; `in` only works when you have `value’ on the left and an iterable data structure like a list, set, dict, etc on the right
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.7968	I want to see if all values in a list (control) are in another list (the one made of the integers the user inputs); But if I’m not wrong, those inputs should be a list themselves as I am asking for them to be appended; However, I think I’m doing it wrong
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`input` will give you strings, so `A` will be a list of strings; while `control` is a list of ints

	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.4019	furthermore, what you’re trying to do requires use of `all`; as in do all these values in `control` exist in `A`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i'd personally use sets; wouldn't require any iteration
	0.0	0.517	0.483	0.4215	true, or list comprehension
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Am I able to order numbers in a set?
	0.153	0.847	0.0	-0.5267	listcomp would be back to using a `for` loop though; no, you can't order numbers in a set but i'm only talking about the comparison; you'd leave `A` and `control` alone except for the `if`
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.3612	if `A` and `control` never grow very large, iteration methods would be fine, btw.; sets are just cleaner

	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.9719	<@Kenny> some suggestions: When iterating through the keys of a dictionary, you can write `for key in dict:` instead of `for key in dict.keys():` If you are using both the key and the value in the loop you may want to consider `for key, value in dict.items():`  `string[0] == '1'` feels more natural than `int(string[0]) == 1`  If you replace the first element of teens with 'ten', you can get simplify parse_two somewhat.  When you are using a list as a constant (like ones, teens, and tens), consider using a tuple instead.  I'd probably move the stringified_int line into the split function and create a new helper function for the building of the string itself. The reason I want to do this is to try to maintain a single level of abstraction in each of our functions.  I think it might be nicer if instead of creating a dictionary with 'hundred', 'thousand', and 'million' as keys, we put them in a list or tuple like you did for ones, teens, and tens.  Here's how it might look: <https://repl.it/McUI>. Overall, I like your approach and it looks good already! Some of my suggestions might be kind of opinionated.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its on staging.
	0.099	0.792	0.109	0.0534	ok, because that `/root/` path to the virtualenv is really weird; are you executing the daemon with `sudo`?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.948	0.052	0.296	ok, the whole issue is you have the virtualenv in the `/root` folder; _bad_; so, it’s really locked down with permissions; normally what I do is use the default user folder, install the virtualenv there in `/home/user_name/.virtualenv/project/....`; and point to that instead
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I got you.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, the clue for that was `EACCESS`; because that’s a kernel issue; and says you have some permission issues; then the path to the virtualenvs was the next big clue
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.5908	Does anyone have any idea how I could accomplish logging of specific calls and stderr to the same filehandler where stdout are specific log-calls whereas stderr are generic script crashes? I can't get the errors to print to the file correctly...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why not use the `logging` module ?
	0.204	0.796	0.0	-0.3182	I am, it's driving me nuts that I can't configure it correctly
	0.072	0.876	0.052	-0.2023	To be honest, what I'm force to now is actually sending all logs to stdout as a downstream program captures the stdout, but I can't get the stderr to be picked up as well...; ; tbh, the filehandler could be ignored
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I thought you wanted to log to a file ?
	0.133	0.867	0.0	-0.25	As mentioned, a downstream program captures the stdout and writes to file, I was a bit unclear
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or do you need it to be read by a downstream program ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's not by choice I should point out
	0.059	0.62	0.32	0.7227	I'm sorry but just to be clear. Would logging everything directly to a file be ok ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It would not in this case
	0.056	0.882	0.063	0.0613	ok; I'm not sure you can redirect exception output to something else than stderr. You could either read from stdout and stderr in your downstream program or do a big `try` `Except` and `LOG.exception`
	0.274	0.726	0.0	-0.8804	I did look at redirecting stderr to stdout but it looked and felt wrong. The downstream program is unfortunately not something I can modify so i'm sort of stuck with this venture
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	I would do a big try except then; or maybe someone else as a better idea
	0.209	0.791	0.0	-0.3034	so I'm confused, you don't want to redirect, but you want your stdout and stderr to go to a file?
	0.062	0.938	0.0	-0.4019	Currently, all logging is sent to stdout. In the event of a script crash, i need to error to also go to stdout. I'm guessing I need to redirect here, but what I found so far looked really hacky, but I suppose that's the way to do it.; Although, it might not be possible at all without some giant try/except as already mentioned?
	0.323	0.599	0.078	-0.6249	do you only want error to go to stdout when a script crash occurs?
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.4019	if it's only when your script crash you could do  ; it doesn't feel that hackish to me
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	I agree with <@Ciera>
	0.043	0.81	0.146	0.636	I suppose you're right. It just looks like a lot of repeating try/except due to it being a `click` initiated script with increasing numbers of subcommands, where the context class created initiates the logging. Might just be due to my stupid setup but i'll give it a go. Thanks!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm not entirely familiar with click but maybe you can set it up before calling your subcommands ?; or passing the subcommand as an arg to the try/except func
	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.7876	Ye, should be doable but then I'd have to break the logging out of the context class; I'll play around with it a bit and see where I end up. Thanks a lot for the input
	0.0	0.94	0.06	0.3182	I've started doing this on scripts to make sure any unhandled exception is in the logs. That way I don't have to rely on users for anything other than emailing me the log. (Haven't automated log uploads yet.)  
	0.212	0.731	0.057	-0.9455	<@Meghan> I'm attempting this now but it seems a bit weird with click and its subcommands; I'm trying to at the top level, but as I said, click seems to be acting weird. Won't return the exception from the subcommand; Where the error should be, I instead get an empty message; It enters the except clause, but my `except Exception as e` gives an empty e; Ah crap, I've gotta run... Wife's gonna murder me if i'm late. Thanks for the input though! I've got some ideas for tomorrow
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why not use opbeat?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Never heard of it. What is it?; I've not used click, but I would assume you run a function that dispatches to other functions, right?
	0.0	0.145	0.855	0.7096	Pretty much yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Then wrap that call with the try/except.; You don't get the exception at all then?; What does log.exception() get?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Wait, I might be the one who effed up...
	0.105	0.781	0.113	0.0516	<@Meghan>: it's a service that basically does what you are describing, I use it for projects all the time to get better error reporting

	0.0	0.869	0.131	0.7193	Best practices question: It seems that the programmer would have to know that  generator co-routine yields 1 (or other integer) iteration each call but that the generator could be anywhere... is there some sort of good practice/convention for referencing co-routines call on a generator?
	0.0	0.957	0.043	0.2732	<@Seema> You can wrap the generator function in another function, which creates the coroutine, calls next() on it, then returns it, so you don't have to manually call next() after instantiation. The internal generator could be defined anywhere and instantiated inside the wrapper. Is that what you mean?
	0.0	0.945	0.055	0.4215	<@Rosamond> Here's an example of a call to a coroutine where the code is right next to the coroutine.  I'm assuming the coroutine could be in any module/namespace.  Is that true? ; if fibonacci_co or any co-routine can be somewhere else, how would programmer/user know that it would have to be iterated.
	0.059	0.941	0.0	-0.4019	I would still call that a generator function since it's only yielding results, a coroutine can take arguments for each iteration and usually has an opening `yield` in the definition.; That's moreso what I mean. Then _coroutine could be defined anywhere. If in another namespace, just import it
	0.0	0.739	0.261	0.5574	I'm under the impression that coroutines are just a special type of generator, is that right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and the coroutine has a next and a generator object and "advances" each yield.  My question is that if this was imported and the function was consumed, how do they know it's a co-routine other than print("Created coroutine.") and print(f"_coroutine({data})")
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That, and if you dir(coroutine()) it should have a send member.
	0.0	0.65	0.35	0.8225	wow, ouch, umm... okay, thanks for tip; will it have a next() or is that only in the generator object?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Time to poke and prod and learn
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	As far as next().. to my knowledge send() replaces it, however there may be cases where you send a single item and yield multiple outputs; So next may be used there?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(brain fuzzy, need coffee, skills)

	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	Thanks for that I'll give it a try
	0.008	0.908	0.084	0.9179	Hey folks. I'm a relative noob, but I've been doing some self learning for a while and I'm looking to break into a technical role.  I'm talking with a person about a position that requires "strong Python and SQL skills". I'm most experienced with Python, but on the main project I worked on that would have required SQL (a flask web app) , I ended up using SQLAlchemy instead of writing SQL statements. I have a basic understanding of SQL though, and could figure out more complex queries with some extra time.; Say they see my resume, decide to call me, and ask about my SQL skills. Would it be reasonable for me to say something like, "Well, I have a basic foundation in SQL, but perhaps to handle some more complex queries I'd set up and use SQLAlchemy"? Or would I get laughed off the phone?
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.4404	I wouldn't mention ORM until they ask; actually don't tell them anything and only answer questions they ask you, that's a safe bet
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	did you use sqlalchemy orm or the core?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	orm
	0.029	0.893	0.078	0.7342	SQLAlchemy is a very useful abstraction layer on top of the database. I’m sort of the opposite. I came into SQLAlchemy from the database world so I had already nearly written applications in raw SQL. That’s one of the reasons I found Python. I needed more power!; you can also dump the sqlalchemy queries and study them.; i gotz all sorts of sqlalchemy tricks in here: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py>; I’ve done plenty of interviews where i may not have been an expert on many parts of the job but if i was able to display with confidence my capability to adapt and learn then that made all the difference.
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.6588	Awesome! Thanks <@Johana> for those ideas and <@Winnifred> for that resource.; Yeah, that's what I'm banking on here. I have a foundation to work from at least, but depending on how long it takes from resume submission to phone interview, I just wanted to have _something_ to say
	0.052	0.765	0.183	0.8625	yea, the safe answer is typically, “i like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection, like sqlalchemy which i’ve done …. yada yada .”; sqlalchemy is a cool toolkit as it doesn’t hide too much of the database away. in other ecosystems a lot of devs don’t even know what the db schema looks like.; cough* .NET
	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.6369	h i b e r n a t e; I love SQLA for this. Once I saw that m2m tables are not abstracted away I fell for Alchemy hard..
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.6486	That may not change your self-assessment of SQL skillz, nor should it, but chances are they will ask a handful of things that are easily covered by those sorts of resources
	0.064	0.894	0.042	-0.2263	<@Kenny> You could also review some SQL interview questions and do some SQL problems on Hacker Rank or something. It's unlikely anything will get much deeper than what you could get out of playing around with that stuff for a bit
	0.0	0.835	0.165	0.4877	I've yet to use SQL Alchemy. Is an ORM really that much better than just writing SQL?
	0.0	0.731	0.269	0.9103	for about 80-90% of the stuff you do, yeah; but there are cases where raw sql is better; especially with optimized queries and such.  in addition, some ORMs can create lots of duplicate queries during the compilation process
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.25	What is the advantage of it?
	0.0	0.618	0.382	0.6771	ease of use; makes quite a few things easier when executing queries
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4019	Interesting. May have to give it a try some time. Since we've switched to DreamFactory I'm usually just calling a stored procedure through a rest api.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then you gotta write that query…
	0.0	0.472	0.528	0.6808	Yes. Most of them are easy though.
	0.0	0.64	0.36	0.5423	I mean, I wouldn’t want to write this query out by hand
	0.121	0.659	0.22	0.6808	Most of our data isn't all that relational. Lots of small projects with hundreds of thousands of records, but relatively flat.; Haha, nah, no interest in writing that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with that, its basically fifteen lines in Django ORM,
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how many records is that ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	me or <@Meghan>?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm, small database but with plenty of tables; so, for this particular query, it aggregates over about 8k rows
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah, gotcha
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.25	so I basically made a model manager in django; created a metrics method to aggregate; and I pass in extra fields in a dict with the evaluation to occur
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	i’d like to write that just to reminisce on my T-SQL and PL/SQL days
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.6124	Should the ORM create the schema or is it better to adapt to an existing one?
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.4939	you can do both; django will let you create models from an existing schema; or you can create it from your model definition
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg>, do you cache a lot of your queries?
	0.091	0.712	0.197	0.6897	yes; and profile; `django-silk` really comes in handy; but caching is a little tricky because you basically have to try to strike a happy medium between cache lifetime and new data
	0.0	0.517	0.483	0.6808	ah, nice, I need to figure out efficient caching
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what are you using?
	0.119	0.881	0.0	-0.631	no current projects right now, but I was running into problems with ORMs and large queries out of a redshift  instance; but I think this is because I hadn’t transformed the data enough to get the data to a point where it requires a simple query
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.5574	hahaha; how can you ask for more?
	0.0	0.753	0.247	0.3182	sure, you just have to consume it first
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In what manner <@Frieda>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if it really is a generator object, you should be able to consume it to a list or a string or whatever (list is probably safest) and then print that
	0.129	0.752	0.118	-0.0531	Yeah I tried to consume to list, and that did not work. Perhaps not truly a generator object?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	look it up in the source and see what's actually being returned? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.441	0.36	0.198	-0.4019	yeah, I fired that off a bit prematurely, sorry
	0.0	0.961	0.039	0.0772	generators are permitted to never halt; or, finish, whatever you want to call it; you could print out the next() item from a generator, or do it a few times; SO suggests one possible alternative:

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Also, why are you defining the class under the root route of the API?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Amie>, I think you need to pass args into your `post(self)` call.; Actually, you’re trying to do that through the decorator.; Did you see the example <@Patty> posted? Move your parser to the module level (outside of your `PodListAPI` resource and then within the `post` call reference your args via `args['name']`, `args['description']`, etc.; <http://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parsing.html#file-upload>

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	Hello, is there a better data structure than this one in order to store synonyms of keywords:
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kathern> the choice of a data structure depends on how you're going to use it; Use triple backticks: ``; <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages>
	0.0	0.84	0.16	0.4215	thank you <@Collette>. I want to use it for speech recognition : to find which command to run based on what the user wants
	0.0	0.857	0.143	0.6124	Sounds like you need a power of stemming, lexical analysis and such. A simple dictionary of synonyms won't work. I'd suggest to take a look at existing implementations, like NLTK (<https://pythonprogramming.net/stemming-nltk-tutorial/>) or even maybe elasticsearch/solr
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in short, this is a non-trivial task
	0.0	0.175	0.825	0.5719	ok, thank you
	0.087	0.855	0.058	-0.12	good to remember though that stemming will probably not help for determining synonyms since a synonym often doesn't look anything like the other word or phrase; you would still need a synonym dictionary of terms; for example, check out section 12.6.3.

	0.0	0.747	0.253	0.5267	I feel like that should be followed with a "But don't write software that is too flexible"
	0.229	0.551	0.22	0.2187	"Don't write software that isn't flexible" is itself a pretty flexible answer.
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	I like the hooks line though
	0.075	0.844	0.082	0.0302	i may have used the word extensible and not flexible but whatevs; it was a number of years ago.
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.3291	I don't often think of my code in terms of events but it's probably worth putting myself in that mindset more
	0.0	0.774	0.226	0.4449	they're interchangeable when you're not being terribly specific about your meaning
	0.024	0.879	0.097	0.6369	Oh boy this is funky, I need to coerce csv values to match the type in the database (to abstract away some ETL stuff), is there a better way than:    where `col_name` is the database column name, `csv_name` is the csv column name, `db_record` is a named tuple from psycopg2, and `csv_row` is a dict from a csv.DictReader row
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	TIL: `type( )( )` pattern
	0.169	0.831	0.0	-0.4717	I am not sure I recommend it yet, it's really the only reliable way I could think of doing the coercion to do the comparisons
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.431	had a need to coerce values from an Excel import, into Django models, and I used a mapping of the columns to the type, not as concise as your example but explicit
	0.054	0.712	0.234	0.8338	I thought about that as an option too - but I like the idea of the database being the "source of truth" for this project since it's just a data pipeline (I want it to be low maintenance). But that is a good option too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do table columns and csv headers have same name or are they similar?
	0.083	0.917	0.0	-0.4215	Not always, but I just expanded it to default to the same if no `csv_to_col` is set on the class; Because that is serving as a mapping of csv row to the db row
	0.0	0.598	0.402	0.5719	yeah, I actually like this. I just noticed you’re using a namedtuple.
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3595	Yep! Psycopg2 has a NamedTupleCursor; also a dictcursor
	0.0	0.616	0.384	0.3595	Yeah, that totally makes sense!
	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.6486	If it's a complex class it probably wont work, but it's all database primitives (Decimal, float, int, string) pretty much
	0.093	0.771	0.136	-0.1212	I don't see anything wrong with using `type` like you have here - you need to read that line a bit carefully to see what's going on, but it strikes me as a reasonable strategy
	0.07	0.752	0.178	0.6486	So I was reading <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/715417/converting-from-a-string-to-boolean-in-python> and I was wondering, what IS the standard? I wrote my own str_to_bool function and just reuse that, but it feels like there should be an easy built-in that I'm missing
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.2411	<@Marcelina> I'm not sure that I get the question, so to clarify, you're trying to evaluate string `"False"` to `False` and `"True"` to `True` or what?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Correct; `bool("False") = True`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	write your own map, and a function to parse it correctly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Which is what I did - I'm asking what's convention
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.5994	Depends on what you're doing, IMO. In cases where you are accepting user input directly from a shell or something, then I would do the approach `input_value.lower() in ['yes', 'y', 'true', '1', ...]`; Otherwise I'd just make sure the thing gives you the right `type`; I don't believe there is a different convention than that
	0.098	0.779	0.123	0.2589	Parsing a payload from a JSON object with users who go back and forth between using a bool correctly in a JSON payload vs sending it as a string; But cool; Sounds good; I just wasn't sure if there was a built-in I was missing
	0.06	0.87	0.071	0.1027	If you are defining the contract for the API, only accept bools; Or give a 400; No reason they can't do the work on the front end since a bool is valid in the JSON spec

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct; so, its a bit of duplicate functionality; `isfile` would work for a path to a file, `isdir` is for a path to a directory; `exists` covers both, with some potential issues of permissions

	0.156	0.746	0.098	-0.1779	I suspect I may have misunderstood the intent of the `seek` way of doing it from the get-go. Understood it as a general better replacement to using `os.path.isfile`
	0.116	0.741	0.143	0.128	No, `seek` is a way to move the current file pointer over the file as you wish
	0.09	0.812	0.098	-0.4451	<@Collette> - thanks for suggestions. have some followup questions though: 1. example? I want a fixture that sets up some Server and then test it - either by providing a fresh Server instance to every test (function scope) or by reusing the same Server for a bunch of tests (class scope) - the Server setting up fixture is the same - the usage is different.  my idea was to have:  but this feels rather redundant, no?  2. regarding the pytest shared session fixture suggestion... wouldn't this mean i'd need to have every fixture define it in it's args?  no way to avoid this? feels like autouse wouldn't fit here as i need access to the shared_state instance somehow
	0.065	0.703	0.232	0.7059	<@Arlean>  1. Yeah, I got what you meant. But _why_ do you need this? What problem you're trying to solve with that? 2. Yes. Just like you'll need `request` fixture requested in every single test
	0.03	0.834	0.135	0.9188	<@Collette>  it is not really a problem, more a constraint. * the Server I'm testing takes a while to bring up and configure, so I would like to minimize this time during tests and have multiple tests run against same Server * on the other hand, some tests are more destructive than others and might affect other tests if they run against the same Server - so I would like to have them run separately * in addition, would like to have the option to decide on which way to run from command line flag and not for example forcing all tests be in classes even if they are classes of single test  hope this makes sense; oh, and for 2. there is a workaround:  so i do not *have* to pass request just for some shared data
	0.099	0.797	0.103	-0.1779	Alright. I'd put these two kinds of tests into separate folders, with different fixtures, and run them like `pytest tests/shared` and `pytest tests/destructive`; To me a cli switch is not enough when doing destructive things. I think you have to be explicit about what you're doing, and it's better to minimize the possibility of running a wrong suite; Anyway, I'd go with two different fixtures
	0.0	0.907	0.093	0.6767	I currently have a colour enum that has a predefined set of standard colours however rarely a custom colour is given that isn't defined in the enum is it possible for the enum to have an else clause?; So that it can also hold the custom given colour?; you can use a heapq; as long as you treat it like a stack

	0.026	0.957	0.017	-0.1901	the current project I'm working on uses an Enum to store a set of default colours; however this was a bad design decision because colours can also be customised; and so now I've run into that issue where a Colour Enum was tried to be created but couldn't because it wasn't pre-defined; is ther esome way to define a custom element in an enum to hold any colour?; ``` &gt;&gt;&gt; from enum import Enum &gt;&gt;&gt; class Color(Enum): ...     RED = 1 ...     GREEN = 2 ...     BLUE = 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; Color(RED) Color.RED &gt;&gt;&gt; Color(BLACK) Color.CUSTOM
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4329	where CUSTOM can be dynamically changed? or just that any non-existant key maps to a pre-existing CUSTOM?; if the first I don't think that's possible with Enum
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	wait let me edit that; ; <@Antionette>
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	How many customs do you want to be able to have?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	for every possible colour
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	So the code using this then goes something like `if Color.RED: color_value = '#ff0000'`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	more correclty the code is  And tries to make a color given a user string ; but now I need it to be able to work for any hex string
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.2144	Yes, absolutely should be a dictionary, but that depends on how much code needs rewritten.
	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.3919	not much, but it just wouldn't be backwards compatible; <@Scot>  well I can do 
	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.25	<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28126314/adding-members-to-python-enums>; There are two reasonable options there. Either an advanced enum written by the author of the enum library, or redefine the enum. I was working on a third option before I hit a bit of a snag.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Someone's told me that Sum Types are what should be used for this but They're not really a thing in python
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.4404	<@Winnie> I'd vote for refactoring; You can't preserve backwards compatibility forever using these kinds of hacks; And since you don't have much code to change yet, it's better to break everything now than later
	0.0	0.749	0.251	0.5719	<@Collette> yeah I'd agree I just wanted to see if there was anything possible to oncsider first
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	Even if that is technically possible, I don't see how that would fit the mental model of enums
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So why would a dictionary make more sense?
	0.0	0.731	0.269	0.7964	<@Winnie> it sounds like you need a mapping between color names and some sort of values. A dictionary can be used to implement such mapping very easy
	0.029	0.871	0.1	0.8637	I came to Python from C/C++ so I tend to shy away from assigning real meaning to the value of an enum. Whether or not that is idiomatic in python I'm not sure, but I feel like it's a behavior that's unlikely to backfire on me. Dictionaries are meant to map from one piece of info to another which sounds more appropriate for your situation. Enums work best when they are compared with each other but not really used as substitute numbers or substitute strings. That's not to say it's the only way to use them, but it seems the most resilient way
	0.0	0.513	0.487	0.5719	Yeah, once the value matters it should be a dict.
	0.0	0.935	0.065	0.2732	well the thing is that there's only ever one reference to a colour name in the code I think an enum was used just because they thought an enum would suit the job
	0.178	0.694	0.128	-0.3369	and it did at the time, but now you want to extend it and it doesn't fit as well as it used to
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	actually
	0.0	0.953	0.047	0.0763	and you can still make it work if you really want, but it will involve a lot of branching depending on whether your enum is custom or not
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.4019	an enum kinda fits because the user should only be able to provide the given values in the enum
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why not reverse the key:value to value:key and run a dict lookup?
	0.194	0.806	0.0	-0.34	<@Winnie> don't you think that contradicts to what you've said earlier?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	disclaimer: it's 2am here
	0.105	0.773	0.123	0.1027	I'm confused, if the user only gets to use the provided values, why do you need custom at all?
	0.019	0.926	0.055	0.5267	okay I think it might be easier to give the longer story so I'm working on the fbchat module, which interfaces with messenger messenger would allow you to configure colours given a set ammount but there was a point where you could just make a get request for any colour so now I have a facebook chat with a black chat bubble now fbchat attempts to read in the colour to its pre-defined enum but now, messenger has made it such that you can no longer make a get request with any colour; so the module needs to be able to accept any colour from a chat but we need to tell users that only these colours in this enum can be actually sent; so what I'm thinking is to re-factor such that on return of a colour, a string is given instead of a ThreadColor object, but on sending, a user must give a ThreadColor object
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so it gets the color options from messenger, and offers just those to the user?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6597	yes; yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	would it work to build a dict from the messenger data and then just catch a KeyError if the user gives something not in the dict?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#fbchat.models.ThreadColor>
	0.0	0.518	0.482	0.4201	You really like enums
	0.212	0.761	0.027	-0.8674	yeah...; <@Sirena> I think it makes more sense to give the user a datastructure that they have to use as opposed to let them send whatever they want but just fail them when they do it wrong
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3612	Might be able to build off of something like this:; if you can somehow find way to get val be a color instead of just the int
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Antionette> you'd just pass the string instead
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.8176	well I meant an instance of `Color`; right now the newly added values are different from the values created when the Enum is instantiated
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	howso
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ie in the example that gets printed Color(2) is Color.RED but Color(3) is Custom3 rather than Color.Custom3; it points to just the name rather than a `Color` with the correct name
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.4404	right; it's probably better to use extend_enum in that case
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	extend_enum?
	0.182	0.647	0.171	-0.0516	Ah, the class method was what I was getting wrong earlier. Thanks for that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Antionette> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/35899963>
	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.5859	ah sure, that looks like its a much more fleshed out version
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Sirena> were you typing something?
	0.202	0.798	0.0	-0.5499	I was, but I've deleted it a couple times since I'm having trouble phrasing what I'm thinking
	0.057	0.943	0.0	-0.1779	You were using Custom#, which avoids the duplicates though.; Would need to check if the name already exists first. But, otherwise I think that should do what Evan is requesting.
	0.121	0.742	0.136	0.0613	Yeah I wasn't sure if a name was actually being supplied or just the color code
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.7855	Essentially, I would say that an enum that is mutable isn't terribly enum-like. I get that you would prefer backward compatibility, but when you extend an enum, you sortof break the agreement you have with the code that an enum is always one set of options
	0.0	0.759	0.241	0.5719	  This should work, other than value can't be changed once an item is created. Which I think is what you would want.
	0.0	0.286	0.714	0.3612	<@Sirena> I agree
	0.0	0.829	0.171	0.6542	And it does look like some of the other models are based on other datatypes so if the refactoring isn't too bad I don't think the maintainers should mind
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.4215	My biggest peeve with this module is camelcase; but yeah this module needs a complete style do-over
	0.0	0.771	0.229	0.6537	yeah, some habits never die. Just gotta hold your nose if you can't talk the maintainer into changing it though

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hello, is possible to explicitly import `*.pyi` files with containing definitions without having actual `*py` file nearby? As an example, TypeScript use such technique to define interfaces that are used only on compilation time, but not available at runtime.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pytest docs? they have a "Getting started" section
	0.0	0.671	0.329	0.6597	Thanks <@Suellen> I'll give it a try; seems like a steep learning curve for a newbie
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I mean, most of the stuff that you would normally use is on the first 10-20 pages
	0.056	0.917	0.028	-0.3197	Yea seems little intimidating I'll give it a try basically I would want to run series of queries against an API . which would return the status bunch of nodes; which would send the data to a database; to display within a web browser; is pytest overkill for such a task ?
	0.0	0.549	0.451	0.6249	pytest will work great for that
	0.028	0.972	0.0	-0.296	<@Kellye> what would you do with the .pyi files after you imported them? In most senses compilation time _is_ runtime, and .pyi is mostly just used for static analysis AFAIK; from PEP484: &gt;&gt;&gt;While stub files are syntactically valid Python modules, they use the .pyi extension to make it possible to maintain stub files in the same directory as the corresponding real module. This also reinforces the notion that no runtime behavior should be expected of stub files.
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.8625	<@Sirena>  that's true, that's why I need them, I want to use custom types from *.pyi files as contracts to function calls. For example defining custom model like  then I could use it as parameter type in function. I assume mypy can detect that anonymous object follow contract of that virtual type from *.pyi file. like: `def func(value:MyModel) ...` then calling it like `func({"myProperty":1});`
	0.112	0.781	0.107	-0.1475	I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that .pyi does not enforce a contract like that during run time; if you want to enforce it, you need ; or something like that; also, I'm not sure I follow your example, if you want the property of MyModel, just use it  ; and while it may not be easy or possible to redesign, typically if you find yourself doing typechecks in python, it's possible and recommended to design them out; none of this is hard and fast, just kind of a best practice when you aren't constrained by other factors
	0.034	0.936	0.03	-0.0772	that's was just an example, basically you end up having 5-10+ props and nested objects. As I referred before, TypeScript makes it possible - you can define an 'interface' that will just specify data layout, but will be cut out after static type checks.; I'm just trying to figure out whether it's possible in python, there's not much information on pyi files; basically resources recommends you to have .pyi files in same structure as your source code
	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.2411	I'm not terribly familiar with TypeScript, maybe someone else can field your question on that, but most python interfaces rely on behaviors/methods rather than on types

	0.145	0.699	0.156	-0.1901	yeah something like that; I tried that but that it returns errors on the imports that live in crunchy_json
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In a very shortened form: `x = {'this': 1, 'that': 2}[bar]`
	0.132	0.781	0.087	-0.296	Might be obvious but I think its worth pointing out that a key error will be thrown if bar is not something you are expecting
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.8627	is there a more elegant way for conditionally assigning a variable based on the parameter passed in the function other than a couple `if` statements?   It almost seems like the spot for case statements but that doesn't seem to be a better solution imo. The reason I'm using strings is because I am actually checking strings as the condition.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	will this work for you?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Then `x = {'this': 1, 'that': 2}.get('bar', 'default')`
	0.117	0.805	0.078	-0.1068	that might actually be nice to wrap in a try/except because I am expecting specific strings and don't want it to continue on if I got something I'm not expecting; because... _I don't trust users!_

	0.063	0.859	0.078	-0.0772	<@Kristi> sounds like to_list doesn't have 3 elements. If you wanted the second element, you want index 1 since the first element is index 0. Is that maybe your issue?; or possibly you have a line that doesn't match that format and ended up with a broken to_list object
	0.0	0.921	0.079	0.4939	<@Sirena> the list should have 6 element and the one I am looking for is the number 2 starting from 0 which is the time stamp; <@Sirena> maybe what you said about the line that doesn't match the format is the issue; <@Sirena> thanks for point that out, do you know how I can fix that?

	0.161	0.638	0.201	0.0772	is that the behavior you want? seems risky to just skip bad input unless you are pretty certain what is going on under the covers there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Sirena> I did it because I know that the logs files that I need always have the same information, so if I find anything that do not match with that criteria I can skipped. The lines that contain less that 3 items were titles around the file.

	0.053	0.891	0.056	0.0258	I don't understand what the aim of your link is; maybe you misunderstood me, I'm not looking for forms I have an existing Class, and I'd like to port it to how sqlalchemy wants it is there something that will automate that for me?
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.168	Okay?.. You want to generate a `sqlalchemy.orm` model based on some arbitrary class attributes?
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	those sound like the appropriate words
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.5574	<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/automap.html> You could use something like this to just take it from the db, otherwise it might be simpler to just create the class
	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.2477	<@Winnie> everything is possible in python, but that would require a lot of hackery hacks. Why do you want to do that? What's your use-case?; Or that's a purely theoretical question?; You'll basically need to re-implement <https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/ext/automap.py> to use a python class instead of a database
	0.0	0.946	0.054	0.2263	<@Vita> the db doesn't exist yet <@Collette> my use case is that my project consists of a scraper that stores its data as objects, but I want to persist those using a db All the classes already exist, but from what I understand, if I want them to be compatible with sqlalchemy, I'd have to essentially re-write them
	0.037	0.927	0.036	-0.0129	Well, no. DB models can, but really shouldn't map directly to objects. How would you declare relationships without writing them manually, for instance?; When you write DB models, you model your database. That's something orthogonal to how you store data in memory.
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.34	well It could be smart and see that classes as fields are just links to another table; but I see what you mean; how are mbid's generated?
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.4215	So here’s MBID info: <https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Identifier>; I’m downloading the data from <http://Last.fm|Last.fm>, so I think it’s up to that community to attach an artist/album/track to its respective MBID, if that MBID exists
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Kenny> you could try generating the correct mbids

	0.078	0.922	0.0	-0.296	gonna have to show how you define those tables; remember, we don’t know how you wrote the code; that said, I suspect you have multiple primary keys; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24872541/could-not-assemble-any-primary-key-columns-for-mapped-table>
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.2023	<@Meg> this is what I have so far <https://github.com/ekohilas/fbchat/blob/sqlalchemy/fbchat/models.py> it wasn't working when each class didn't have a primary key, which I thought would be fine since sqlalch would have each class make its own primary key since it inherits from base?
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	looking in the actual code for `declarative_base`, it doesn’t seem like it actually sets primary key attribute by default; <https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/ext/declarative/api.py#L268>

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what's the output of `pip --version`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Using pip install textract; pip 10.0.0.dev0 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-10.0.0.dev0-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
	0.074	0.926	0.0	-0.34	so, lots of times when you install to system python, it won’t let you do it due to permissions; when you ran `pip install textextract`, did you get any permision errors?
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	Yes. I added sudo then and it installed properly.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Also, how did you manage to install a development version of `pip`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm, I just ran this command - sudo easy_install pip
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And I got that version of pip.
	0.216	0.431	0.353	0.3818	Great news, your machine is now a mess.
	0.048	0.889	0.063	-0.0772	basically, pip already was installed on your system; and there are a number of system-critical programs that are pinned to that python version; so when you overwrote that, you’ve possibly messed up a few things; if you had just done `pip install -U pip`, that would have worked fine
	0.0	0.904	0.096	0.2023	<@Collette> I was not aware of how important that command would be. <@Meg> How do I go about fixing it ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeah… protip: _never_ run pip as root (i.e. with sudo)
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.6562	Guys, read about Virtual Environments!!! It will save you many hours of your future llife!!!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or if you do, know what you’re doing.
	0.0	0.55	0.45	0.5994	<@Cynthia> Ok. I will definitely keep that in mind.
	0.065	0.935	0.0	-0.2023	the consequences of doing so tend to be irreversible; and also, don't run easy_install ever, especially to install pip; there exist ensurepip and get-pip.py for that scenario
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	Oh ok. I will do that going forward.
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.6597	that said, there’s also the issue of how easy it is to do something like this
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.3736	Ok, Can I remove pip ? Meaning the one I overrode ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup.
	0.147	0.638	0.215	0.4601	yeah the best way would be to reinstall. Otherwise you might have trouble in the future that will be really hard to debug
	0.0	0.532	0.468	0.5267	yeah I’d restore from your last backup

If using a pool of 2, what's the proper python way to assign a drive letter to each worker so they are writing to each drive at the same time?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this on linux or windows?; because if you’re on linux, use rsync with parallel; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24058544/speed-up-rsync-with-simultaneous-concurrent-file-transfers>
	0.135	0.865	0.0	-0.4215	Sadly, windows.; Citrix is locked down so I don't have access to powershell or cmd, just the shutil in python
	0.156	0.844	0.0	-0.4149	they’re not making it easy on you, huh?; <http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp>; would you be able to install that?

	0.051	0.717	0.232	0.8316	yeah, I can; well, you probably could do something with shutils and multi-processing; but in all in all, using something like deltacopy or something similar would be better for you; no development time required for you; and a production-ready application with years worth of work and bugfixes
	0.09	0.542	0.368	0.8271	Yeah, but it doesn't address the cherry picking of files though which stinks otherwise, this would be a great solution
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why do you need to cherry pick?; why not restart from zero
	0.0	0.867	0.133	0.3182	because those files are already in azure; everything is going to azure from an on-prem solution
	0.118	0.778	0.104	0.1571	I’m still not sure; you want to copy everything from azure to local; last time this was tried, about 30% of the transfer succeeded
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	out of 100 files in nested folders, i may only need 20 as the other 80 already exist in azure.

	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.9377	i've a dictionary that has index as key,    and list of key    the list needs to be sorted in descending order based on the value present in the dict which i was able to do.  but in case of equal values, i need to sort it according to their indices in ascending order  currently i'm doing it by looping over the sorted list and then comparing value again side by side maintaining two pointers. Can you please suggest some elegant way of doing this.
	0.0	0.709	0.291	0.765	<@Marquita> I'm under the impression that sorted is stable and that you could first sort reversed on value then on key achieving both desired outcomes
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.296	<@Seema> You are correct about sorted being stable - <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts>; That documentation also goes on to use that fact to give an example of sorting based on multiple attributes
	0.0	0.671	0.329	0.5994	Yeah its definitely an interesting/unique way of looking at multiple sorting params

	0.069	0.846	0.085	0.128	I would suggest the No Starch Press books for getting started, they helped me a lot when I was getting going just 2 or 3 years ago; <https://www.nostarch.com/catalog/python> anything that looks interesting in here

	0.048	0.887	0.064	-0.0935	so are we touting coding challenges as a way to learn programming faster or something?; i don’t think challenges have helped me learn a language as much as getting practice using concepts I already know and learning to use them in new ways.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it was more about linting and humans than about functional testing though, very nuanced
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.4871	can anyone suggest popular IoC (inversion of control) package to use? PyPI provides too much to choose from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=dependency+injection&amp;submit=search>
	0.0	0.95	0.05	0.504	Is there any real reason to using an ORM (like sqlalchamy) besides not having to write queries yourself? I personally have my own module for storing/executing/returning queries and at times it runs faster than the ORM, obviously because a human is better at constructing complex queries than a computer is (for now). So besides the obvious, are there other reasons you guys find yourselves using one?
	0.195	0.71	0.096	-0.5571	<@Lory> I generally try to avoid ORMs since I think they are often the wrong approach to the general problem of database abstraction, so you're not alone, but I'm sure you'll get _plenty_ of arguments for why you should use one
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Issac> how maintainable is that, though?
	0.151	0.806	0.043	-0.743	<@Meg> you mean not using an ORM?  I would tend to argue that the types of abstractions that ORMs introduce is increasing the complexity of the code and introduces more maintenance overhead than not using one, although like anything else in development you can do it badly and incur a lot of pain
	0.538	0.462	0.0	-0.3612	sorry no, my small module
	0.132	0.789	0.079	-0.1945	<@Meg> There's a middle ground between ORM and raw SQL (like <http://knexjs.org/> for node, not sure of a good example in python) that helps with maintainability while being a more simple abstraction
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.2732	django ORM works similar, I think; as well as sqlalchemy, in which you can write raw sql and it’ll handle it for you
	0.1	0.872	0.028	-0.4215	My biggest gripe is that it feels awkward to use one in the code, and that's just because of a lack of familiarity with using ORM's, So I figured what does it _really_ matter if I just use my own
	0.062	0.815	0.122	0.296	and for your own projects, thats fine; if you’re working on non-super critical performance in a team, then I would definitely make you justify the case of not using an ORM if I were interviewing you
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.7003	and it just that, I'm trying to get into free lance web application design so I'm slowly building my own modules for things I feel are bloated like ORM's, Login modules, etc...
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.7783	Like most things you just need to be aware of the trade-offs, the once that have been mentioned incl. Imagine working on a large team or needing lots of people to be able to access and modify things in the database (like will happen many many times with a fairly complex dynamic website) and trusting all developers to get the SQL correct. That's a maintainability nightmare.
	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.3612	bingo; that there is my primary argument against; especially if the actual performance difference is a few percents overall in load and query time
	0.0	0.898	0.102	0.6249	And you may find that you only need to do one or two db calls, which is great, and you may find that as you maintain more and more projects all that "custom" SQL boilerplate wastes time.
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.6249	furthermore, as a freelance web dev, <@Lory>, you have to consider the ‘when’ case, when another developer takes over your project; how easy is it for the other person/team to get up and running with your setup?
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.6361	i think you should decide what is most important to you when working with the ORM or the core.; ORM is business objects and Core is more schema-centric.; if you want to be down in the weeds and know your db schema you should use core. if you want to deal with things like business objects use the ORM.
	0.035	0.85	0.115	0.5499	I would agree with <@Meg> there, freelancing does come with the burden of not just doing the most technically right thing, but the most expected thing since a lot of what your client is paying for is something that can serve as a baseline for future devs to continue to modify and support the application
	0.09	0.857	0.053	-0.2263	it depends on the level of abstraction you want. I’ve used both quite extensively.; i try to avoid raw sql as much as possible.
	0.128	0.796	0.076	-0.576	I think ORMs are problematic because they unnecessarily couple several parts of the system that should be decoupled (datatype definitions, constraint solving, persistence, and transport of network attached data).  My personal experience is that in projects of any size they often end up causing more harm than good, and architecturally I dislike the types of applications that tend to have them central to the application
	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.7269	not all ORMs are created equal tho.; sqlalchemy’s orm is significantly better than others i’ve used.; for one it uses the unit of work pattern so you aren’t going to commit anything until it all works.
	0.166	0.783	0.051	-0.5729	<@Issac> no argument there with your points about complexity and coupling.  But is that really significant, though?; and personally, in my projects, I’ve had to drop to raw sql a handful of times when performance was required
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html>
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.7251	I really don’t like writing SQL, and only do it when the profiling shows there will be a distinct difference; and that’s after optimizing the db structure, adding indexes, and doing everything to reduce the number of queries executed
	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.5106	<@Meg> obviously I think it's significant, I don't expect everyone would agree with my personal weight of the tradeoffs though.
	0.153	0.568	0.278	0.296	oh, certainly. Like I said, there’s valid arguments for and against; though, am wondering
	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	have a good meetup
	0.0	0.834	0.166	0.4926	thanks!  its put on by ESRI, and I know a few of the map/geo people going to be there
	0.182	0.74	0.079	-0.9404	Hey all, in Python 2.7, using `unittest.assertRaisesRegexp`, how come it’s giving me false regex matching failures for my own exception classes, but working fine with something like `ValueError`?; in the fail message it says: &gt; AssertionError: “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx” does not match “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx”; When… those… are… identical… ?; It’s not some weird text encoding comparison that’s failing, is it?; Actually nevermind, it’s something else going wrong somewhere, if I change the code to raise a ValueError instead I still get the same matching fail
	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.1779	Can you post the code that is failing?; If you have that exact string as the regex to match, you might need to escape the parens
	0.029	0.903	0.068	0.2755	Hi guys, i’m writing a module to read/write/edit files on target fpt server, I know python has supported ftp lib. But i just curious if I look for the folder files (in the server) and try doing nasty stuff with the file like normal file, and the ftp server can detect change, update it back to the ftp user? I dont mind write the module in the same server with fpt, but are there any drawback if I go down this path?
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.3612	What book do you guys recommend for a new python programmer that doesn't have programming experience. 
	0.0	0.704	0.296	0.7425	Think Python 2e.; A friend of mine was also new to programming and he found it really helpful.
	0.111	0.735	0.154	0.4404	I'd have to go with <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/> , partly because the book is free to read (the physical book still costs), partly because it's accessible and partly because it doesn't presume.  It lacks real apps and takes awhile to get going but it's free and if they put down the book for something better, no harm done.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The automate book still assumes you know basic programming concepts
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	the book does?  I thought it was based off the site which has things like 
	0.125	0.713	0.162	0.2238	`file(s)` is a regex that matches the string `files`, but not the string `file(s)`.; `assertRaisesRegexp` kinda sucks if you just want to match literal strings, sadly. To do that reliably, you need something like: ; Sometimes, it's easier to use the context manager instead: 
	0.053	0.871	0.076	0.3331	<@Ines> I don't think that regex will help you since the structure of languages is more based off of context sensitive grammars. Regular expressions (finite automata) aren't powerful enough to represent the evaluate same set of strings as CSG's. (I could be wrong though, it's been years since I've done anything with computer science theory).; Hey all, Is there a way for me to be able to run a cleanup script when I use `deactivate` on my python envs? I set some environment variables in my `.env` that I would like to clear away when I'm done working on something.
	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.5719	I’m trying to write an application that will search for indentation made with 4 spaces or with tabs, and replace them with 2 spaces. In have found 2 options for doing this:   1. with fileinput, but this seems to have some limitations and I don’t know if it can do what I want it to do 2. with re regular expressions which one would you recommend?
	0.066	0.878	0.056	-0.101	<@Ines> Oh wait, what am I talking about. I totally missed your question (It's well past my bedtime).   - get lines from your input file - count how many spaces there are before the first character in the line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	- divide that count by four, then multiply that by two. - take the substring that's all text, prepend ((space_count / 4) * 2)
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.3612	I’d probably recommend simply using a regex, then you don’t have to count; replacing four spaces or a tab with two spaces will work, regardless of how many multiples of four or tabs (or even a mix) there is
	0.074	0.763	0.163	0.5093	<@Junita> thank you! I was thinking about fileinput as that will save me the trouble of opening the file, reading its content, fix the indentation, write back the content, close the file
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.6808	also note it might just be easier to do this with a tool like sed, unless you want to do use this as a learning exercise
	0.062	0.845	0.092	0.4137	I think it will confuse the regex. Assume the dashes are spaces, and the underscores are the replacement. Such that `----` gets evaluated to `_`.  What happens with `--------` (eight spaces)? Does it get evaluated like `_----` then `__`? Or does something weird happen like `-_---` where the regex wont capture the other 4 spaces.
	0.0	0.802	0.198	0.6652	but to be honest, I haven’t found how to search for patterns using line.replace… this is why I switched to re
	0.097	0.903	0.0	-0.1027	I say screw it and divide space count by two and the append the text.
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.0772	learning exercise and also I want a script that can be used independently
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Forsure!; One sec, I'm whipping something up
	0.132	0.671	0.197	0.2325	&gt; I think it will confuse the regex.; I think regexes are not easily confused %); They are a powerful tool with maths 'n stuff backing them up
	0.0	0.766	0.234	0.7269	<@Kayce> it’s pretty easy, you make a match (such as `^(\s{4}|\t)`) and then feed it into `re.sub`, which can handle multiple replaces: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>
	0.277	0.723	0.0	-0.5574	Regex evaluated an input of 8 spaces to 6; =/ I'm no bueno with regex
	0.199	0.667	0.133	-0.3365	True! I don't come across them terribly often though! Any sharp regex knowledge quickly fades after a week.
	0.108	0.892	0.0	-0.4871	most editors/ides have something to do that project wide; how would replace have done that automatically though?  Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you said you had done already?
	0.209	0.491	0.3	0.126	np, and yeah doesn’t hurt to do it as a learning exercise!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can someone explain to me what virtual envs are? How/why are they used? And maybe how I can/should start using them?
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	<@Amee> What is the syntax error that it's throwing?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	invalid syntax
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	<@Amee> I bet the actual syntax error is somewhere above
	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4927	<@Amee> posting the full traceback is often more useful than the code.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Amee> can we get the full traceback?
	0.31	0.69	0.0	-0.6597	What is the error that's being thrown?  Not the source ,but the error itself.
	0.144	0.856	0.0	-0.4019	^^^ the traceback <@Amee> the full error. It should have a lot more detail than just "invalid syntax"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmmm does the code run?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it does
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and what is your flake8 version?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	&gt;  CPython 2.7.10; Of course `print()` is invalid syntax on python 2
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i havent had the issue before using `print()` only on this app
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Amee> either you had `from __future__ import print_function` or you have been actually using `python3`
	0.0	0.639	0.361	0.3089	or you didn't use arguments
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(other than what needed to be printed)
	0.0	0.871	0.129	0.269	so this is a good question… i have 2.7.1 installed; but also install the latest via homebrew
	0.0	0.805	0.195	0.4404	`print(foo, bar)` on py2 is truly `print (foo, bar)`, i.e. not a function call
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how do i make everything point to the latest version; i followed this
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or use `python3` to open up the python 3 shell; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i always use python3 in the shell
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> you still have to install python3 in osx
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Amee> in which case did you install flake8 onto the right python version?
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	yeah i done this via homebrew
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	Sounds like you installed it into the python2 folder
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so is a python2 flake8, not a python3
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i used easy_install to install pip
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it probably defaulted to python2 pip; try pip3; see if that command works; and remove the old flake8 before you reinstall it via pip3
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.4215	especially if you see `which pip` pointing to 2.7; but if you do `pip3`, it should point to your 3.x install; yep
	0.078	0.746	0.176	0.4404	If you're confused which pip points to which python, it's better to call `python3.5 -m pip`; Then you'll get a correct version of pip for sure
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6369	cool thanks.
	0.09	0.737	0.173	0.3818	Does anyone know of some good reading material on python's setup tools? I feel like most of the articles I've come across are just a waste of time
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how so?  what’s lacking?
	0.046	0.843	0.111	0.8812	I feel like all the tutorials/articles/etc have read as if the person they're trying to teach already knows the stuff and I haven't been able to fully pull out all the pieces that make it work. Like specifically how to structure your package with an __init__.py and why you can leave it empty and why you may or may not want to. How to do simple local pip installs of your project if you're not interested in publishing on pypi, like in the case of a webapp; I feel like they are all hyper focused on going from project to pypi and these are the steps to get there without ever really explaining anything. By "they" I just mean various articles I've found by googling from trusted sources to random people writing blog posts
	0.029	0.824	0.147	0.8558	Just now seeing these responses (sorry).  <@Seema> Ok, was the panel from this year? I would love to check it out <@Ronni> I agree unit tests are easier to write, and I actually want functional tests more for a documentation for the devs to know the workflow more than anything. I was really shocked when I left a project for a year to come back to it and instantly understand where I left off and what needs to be done because of functional tests with user story comments
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the function is to make queries to a monitoring DB
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How familiar are you with SQL?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	from 1 to 10 I would say 3; maybe 4
	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.6249	ok sounds good not that I don't mind putting the time in and learning to write sql queries
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.8689	yea, i’m not saying you do. i’m thinking in perspective of time usage.; you would need to alter the connection string and it will work for mysql.; that’s the beauty of using something like sqlalchemy. it has abstracted the nuances of the different databases.; if you want to switch to postgres you can pretty much just change the connection string.
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	yea I know exactly what you mean by the time efficiency
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and just to get this right the session interacts with the ORM ?
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.1406	So i guess session maybe the way to go then again I wouldnt mind learning the engine as well but it might be more of a learning curve
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so now you can work with the database as you would any other python object.; i would learn the core after the ORM.; SQLAlchemy is stand-alone so you can integrate it into anything.; a CLI app you got it, a web app you goit.; here is a flask app that uses sqlalchemy. <https://gist.github.com/m1yag1/d354ab69398ab84f72f9e0b8c712ffb6>
	0.22	0.081	0.699	0.7088	nice thats pretty damn cool !
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.6908	check out lines 171-87; that’s a class model of the table in the database.; it’s faster if you model your database this way. you may have to do that. or you can reflect the db like in my first example.; sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database.; i’ve successfully ported applications using this very feature from microsoft sql server to postgresql.

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	it does this via reflection.; it’s just an easy way to start working with the database.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	:+1:
	0.055	0.945	0.0	-0.2755	i use it a lot to do adhoc queries.; i do not recommend it for applications with a lot of db tables.; it can slow things down trying to “reverse engineer” the database schema if the database has tons of tables.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm makes sense
	0.0	0.807	0.193	0.7506	i wrote an app a couple years back that would reflect a database and provide a web api for CRUD on all the tables. it took like 10minutes to reflect the db.; lol; CRUD = create update and delete
	0.0	0.73	0.27	0.8176	that’s fine.; you can even create another engine for another db and and save to a different database lol.; if you needed to save locally for example.

	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.7783	setuptools isn’t going to go put it on your server. you can use distutils to create a source distribution which is fine.; it will essentially create a tarball of your app you can copy to the server and extract.; you’ll use distutils for that.; Personally, i would use something like ansible or docker to deploy your app.; two things for that you will need a `<http://Manifest.in|Manifest.in>` file and `setup.py`; the idea is to create what is known as a “build artifact”.

	0.059	0.862	0.08	0.4137	So, I find myself recreating an existing Java application in Python.  One aspect is to generate an output XML file that must conform to a DTD file.  I've been using lxml.etree for generating the xml file.    I have one problem.  The DTD requires certain types of nodes to occur before other types.    Before I start write sorting logic, is there anything that would consult a specified DTD and sort accordingly?; Assuming no, any best practice on sorting peer nodes by node-type?

	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.3612	i don’t think so. you’ll have to generate the file and then validate it.; unless there is something new. I used to do HL7 messaging which had a similar workflow.

	0.012	0.782	0.206	0.9731	gotta love windows nt.; ah i see you build web apps in it and it will deploy them at a very expensive cost.; the big benefit i see a system that is geared for sending XML messages is that they typically have logging, retrying, etc. built in. It makes it really nice to just set it up and forget about it. I remember sometimes my workflow might hang up but the help desk guy had a login where he could restart the process.; mirth may be able to do what you want as well. it’s opensource and geared to HL7 but HL7 is XML like anything else so i’m sure it can do a lot.

That’s not a knock on you, just a guess at what their issue is.; As far as gaining experience, I’d maybe recommend working with an agency if possible a junior or mid level.; This might be a better conversation to have in <#C1DFN115F|freelance> though, it’s not general technical help

	0.148	0.671	0.181	0.128	`dict(your_dict)` should work, no?; oh no, it returns list types as values
	0.071	0.816	0.112	0.1531	<@Yan> your result example is inconsistent. Why `'*conciliation_status*'` is gathered into a list, but `'group_id'` is not? I would expect to see `'group_id': ['1']` instead; If that's exactly what you want, then there's no sane generic solution.
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	yeah, i figured — you’ll need something more custom

	0.027	0.824	0.149	0.9746	Good morning everyone!!! (its morning here in EST); I am quite novice and need a little direction. Just point me in the direction and I am happy to figure it out from there. I learn better that way.  I am trying to write a program to ping all hosts in a subnet and then display the results in a table. What I have already. (both found somewhere on the internet and modified for my needs...) 1. A "ping sweep" that will output the IP and DNS name of any host that respondes. 2. A simple Plotly program that will read a CSV and output it in an HTML table.; .; I am struggling to figure out how best to get my data into the plotly table. I am trying to avoid writing to a csv and then reading it back into the plotly table. Unless that is the best way to achieve my goal, then I will happily do that. Ideas?  I am currently reading up on dictionaries and seeing if that may serve my purpose... Thank you for any help!!!
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	<@Virgen> you already have your data being parsed from the csv? You can use jinja templates to dynamically build the results into the table
	0.078	0.819	0.103	-0.1007	negative. the plotly bit is just pulling data from a random test csv.; the ping sweep bit runs an if/then loop which tests each IP and returns the IP and DNS name if anything responds.; <@Lory> I'll check into jinja as well, thx!
	0.112	0.888	0.0	-0.4404	can you pop that into a code block, can't tell where the indentation is supposed to be; little plus sign next to the text input

(i'm the webfilter admin...); <@Lory> I got the webfilter admin to fix his gear...; that's the general loop that outputs the data. So, rather than just printing the output to console, I want to store it in a way that can be read into and displayed in a table.
	0.037	0.826	0.138	0.8316	well for starters, that initial for loop where you're running `ping` on the servers, you're only ever capturing the output of the last one that runs in `output`, unless `stdout=...` is supposed to be within the for loop which it looks like it should be but is just an indentation error; yea so I would build some kind of dictionary or nested list and then use a jinja template to iterate over that data structure and create a table entry for each. That would definitely be a fairly easy approach

	0.04	0.89	0.069	0.7404	OK, going a little bonkers. I have a package whose actual name has an underscore `my_package`, but in the setup.py, for the name attribute, I accidentally put `name="my package"` - I ran setup.py a few times with success, before realizing it was naming the package `my-package`. Now, I've fixed the name so it's `name="my_package"`, but setuptools keeps putting `my-package` in the PKG-INFO file. I've looked everywhere for any trace of the name with a hyphen or a space, I've deleted the caches, run `setup.py clean`, changed the name to something else entirely, removed the parameter, traced through the setuptools code to see how it's set, and I can't get it to stop naming it `my-package` in PKG-INFO. Anyone have this issue before and have any suggestions?; wondering if a new virtualenv would help; but that seems silly too; this is running in a virtualenv based on python 3.5 on windows 10; tried in Python 2.7 (which had no knowledge of the package) with the same result. In the past, I've been able to have packages with underscores instead of hyphens; It may just be PyPI acting differently than I expect too - looks like the other packages I've made with underscores show as hyphens in PKG-INFO but as underscores on PyPI - this one doesn't

	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.6249	<@Carolin> Thank you for answering. I have the pair of lat and long of a location. Wanted to find the max and min.; HI all. I am looking for a package or script which helps us to find the max and min of a latitude and longitude.
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.8464	max and min of what?; each of lat/long?; max/min of position from equator?; from prime meridian?; regardless, this is a pretty common homework question, when a student is asked to find the maximum and minimum value of a given data structure; its not hard to get a solution that executes in linear time of O(n); what have you tried?; <@Carolin> `list` is a reserved word in python; should be the variable name that you’ve assigned for your list; eg, `pontoA = row[0]`
	0.0	0.899	0.101	0.8422	<@Meg> thanks man, I have a structure like this: points_neighborhood = [["Pitimbu",[-5.876271, -35.224500]],["Planalto",[-5.858102, -35.251586]]] in Jupyter Notebook if I do  for rows in points_neiborhood:        print(rows[0]+", ", end='')        print(list[0], end='')        print(",", end='')        print(list[1]) it just works... But when I go to transcript this to my .py and execute it shows me "TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable" list[0] gives me the latitude info... but when I do the same in my .py it not works...; How can I iterate through these values?; rows[0][0] does not work it returns me the first letter of the fist value; Like 'P' in ["Pitimbu",[-5.876271, -35.224500]]
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and not -5.876271
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.34	because `row[0]` is a string; `row[0]` value is `‘Pitimbu’]
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how I got <@Meg>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`row[1][0]` would return `-5.876...`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what you have to remember is you can access a character in a string by its index position
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`and`, `or` and `not` are the boolean ops

	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.6908	<@Evelin> a couple things come to mind  1. Hack day in office - each person picks something a little out of their area of expertise and tries to do something that has potential to benefit the company/ongoing projects.   2. Host or attend a local meetup in one of the languages you work in 3. Consider Pluralsight/Udemy/Safari Online,  and other education sites as an employee perk 4. One or two conferences per year.  A different dev can go to each, and give a presentation/report when he/she comes back.  Previous position sent people to JavaOne, and they gave illuminating presentations after 5. Start being active in the dev group of the language/framework you typically work with.  eg, django developers on IRC, flask, etc
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Conferences?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	+1; also we're trying to implement a process where everyone can suggest a topic that he wants to give a presentation or wants to hear about it from someone else; and those presentations would be once a month or so
	0.067	0.832	0.101	0.4404	yes.  I suggested something similar a couple times at my office and it was done twice before the others developed a lack of interest; tough balance - does all the content come from a clique group, and the rest of the team kinda coasts along, or is it required that everyone do at least one a year?
	0.0	0.772	0.228	0.7096	we won't make it required to attend; but want to provide food, drinks etc. to encourage people to stay after working hours
	0.159	0.659	0.182	0.1531	yeah, this was like a scheduled block during the day, once a month; usually 90 minutes at 3p, and everyone could leave after
	0.268	0.732	0.0	-0.5106	and do you have some more conclusions why it failed?
	0.169	0.831	0.0	-0.6908	<@Evelin> too bad you’re out of the London area, or I could point you to some people at a company I know in Guildford; company culture, no driving force pushing standards and such.
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	ok, and how big is the company?
	0.081	0.552	0.367	0.8313	entire team is pretty lazy in a number of ways, and very comfortable; 5 devs total, 15 people in all; so a pretty small one

	0.417	0.583	0.0	-0.6124	Ah right now I see why you asked; no worries
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.1779	Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class, or is there a cleaner way of doing it?; I tend to do a lot of `assert isinstance(param1, CustomClass)`
	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.7717	a list comprehension sounds like the best way to do it based on my experiences; unless there's a way to just do the entire list in one go which I am not aware of personally
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yah, I didn't see some hidden functionality in isinstance, at least from the official docs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But you won't be using the resulting list anyway... Why not just `for param in params: assert(....)`?
	0.0	0.952	0.048	0.1901	you could have your class self validate before being appended to the list or something too. depends on your code structure but the various approaches all do the same thing at the end of the day
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I personally wouldn't use a list comprehension if I didn't intend to use the resulting list for anything
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	could also do a test in the list comprehension, and use `any` and `all` type checks
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.3252	 Should you really do that and not let it fails later on ?
	0.138	0.776	0.086	-0.5994	My general philosophy is to fail fast.  In this tool, if a user provides me with wacky input data, it could be devastating to the downstream systems that I'm re-configuring.; I do like the potential idea of using any/all, need to play with that.  Could make the code more readable
	0.0	0.534	0.466	0.8225	yeah I use that sometimes and like it.  the inline assert seems nice too as well
	0.028	0.796	0.176	0.8353	Hi all, wondering if anyone could help make my code less repetitive.

	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.3818	Do you know what the order is prior to run time or is it dynamic?
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	sounds like you need to make a priority queue
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.0772	actually all I have is dictionary with some json objects in it ,I want to know how can I check if one of those objects come before another one or not
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Dictionaries are unordered by default
	0.083	0.761	0.156	0.2718	yes you are right; that's why is not that easy to do that , my dictionary is specific dictionary which the order is important to me
	0.085	0.812	0.102	0.1435	Lists are ordered so that's reliable but only helps if you know what you're looking for. I've never used priority ques so I'm not sure how they work personally
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You could try using an ordereddict; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let me check thnx; I don't thinks that's will work <@Antionette>
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.34	<@Elanor> are you looking to sort your dictionary by key or value?
	0.0	0.83	0.17	0.5994	ordered dicts only work with insertion order; sounds like you need to write a list comp to output your dict to a list based on the key value
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I thought 3.6 had order in order out for dicts, now I have to go check...
	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.2755	3.6 does have dicts that are ordered by default. However, they aren't promised to be in future versions.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	totally understand that, and he may not be able to 3.6 for a variety of reasons
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I;m using 2.7
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.34	and when you say they are ordered, are they ordered by a key or a value or are you thinking that they're are indexed?
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.25	They are ordered in the way they were created, not based on any other logic.
	0.0	0.88	0.12	0.3527	<@Elanor> what is it about OrderedDict that think won't work?; and is the creation of the dictionary a one-time thing?
	0.085	0.792	0.123	0.0964	my dict's value is another dictionary; I think I solved this problem , because I have enabled the timpestamp; and then I dont need to have the dictionary ordered or not , since it will come with timestamp
	0.079	0.707	0.215	0.5057	conceptually it doesn't change the problem of ordering if it is nested or not; Yeah there's an easy method there
	0.108	0.799	0.093	0.1287	Hi, I recently was asked to work on a django project and I’m having a little difficulty getting the app set up locally.  Python 3.6 and django 1.11.  I created the database and went to run the migration files, but I get an error saying “relation table_name does not exist”.  That table should be created by the first migration file based on what I can tell.  I’m not sure why it would be complaining about a table not existing when there are no tables at all (brand new db).  Should I be deleting the migration files and running makemigrations?  That doesn’t seem to make much sense, but not sure at this point. I’m a rails and phoenix developer, this is my first time with django.  Any help or suggestions would be awesome!
	0.058	0.822	0.119	0.3182	You should probably run your own. Who knows what state the DB was in when those first migrations were generated; It sounds like you're missing some or the tables/database were created outside of Django
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	should I delete the migrations folder and run makemigrations?
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.3182	Yes..; an make sure you have the database existing; makemigrations and migrate..
	0.088	0.912	0.0	-0.4019	the database exists, so I deleted the migrations folder and ran makemigrations, I got the same error as before.  ‘’'psycopg2.ProgrammingError: relation “proposals_proposal” does not exist LINE 1: ...estions”, “proposals_proposal”.“final_price” FROM “proposals...‘’'
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Try running `manage.py migrate proposals`; I've had migrations that got in to a state where one app had to be run before all the others
	0.322	0.516	0.161	-0.3595	same error, it’s like it’s stuck!  I can’t get away from it.
	0.31	0.69	0.0	-0.4019	Which migration file is throwing the error?
	0.113	0.855	0.032	-0.5927	Well, there isn’t any migration files now, I deleted the entire directory.  So in theory, it shouldn’t be throwing an error at all on a migration file.; but prior to deleting the directory, I ran the very first migration file 0001_initial.py and it produced the same error.
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	CAn you share the stack trace
	0.096	0.726	0.178	0.3612	so, when making a library that you plan on only supporting 3.6+, do you still use or worry about things like `six` or custom `compat.py` modules?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Bruno> I don't. Why?
	0.0	0.566	0.434	0.3182	just curious. i havent either.
	0.0	0.371	0.629	0.5255	Morning  everyone! :}
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	good evening
	0.0	0.566	0.434	0.7845	<@Bruno> i would love some help if you don't mind me asking
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	@Furkanzmc thank you
	0.143	0.857	0.0	-0.25	i'm currently sudying on team treehouse right know and i'm stuck on a question
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	any advice anyone?
	0.474	0.526	0.0	-0.4019	what is your problem
	0.444	0.556	0.0	-0.34	its saying i made a mistake
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	check where your quotes are; `.format()` is a function that operates on a string
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it says that i don't have to print() anything to pass the quiz, so how do i use the .format() in my variable?; i understand how to use it in print()
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.3612	when in a terminal like that, you dont need to use print as whatever the result is, it will output to the console.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh
	0.046	0.954	0.0	-0.4019	so, look at the format, on how you use string.format(), then compare to how you are using format. there is a syntax error in your code.; one of the last few lines; look at the last line and what is spit out. it means that the line before it is one whole string; did you find it <@Ricki>?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	This is what i have 'code' subject="Treehouse loves{}".format(name)
	0.213	0.787	0.0	-0.4019	thats the line with the error; in the image, its different
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you moved the last double quote
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i just updated it to what you typed
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.4696	that should work. `subject` should now spit out the proper text; you had the last double quote at the end; do you see what the error was? is it working for you now?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	might need a space between `loves` and `{}` ?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.8074	np; good luck
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	what is the latest stable version of 3.4?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	locally pyenv tells me it is `3.4.6`; <@Winnifred>
	0.189	0.58	0.231	0.1511	Ah, thanks <@Bruno>!; I need to learn that command. I r `pyenv` n00b.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Si; just check out the pyenv library; i dont use it to manage my virtual envs. i just use it to install python versions.; i use pipenv
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.296	gotcha, what are your thoughts about installing virtualenv on each version and creating them that way?
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.3527	what do you mean?; create a venv for each version of python?
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.2732	well, installing a venv manager on each version
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.4939	i just create them as I need them; nah.; if you install pyenv you can use that to manage installation of whole python versions. then i just use pipenv to manage my environemnts. which uses `pew` under the hood. so i use that to create the actual env.
	0.0	0.345	0.655	0.2263	ah, okay
	0.017	0.907	0.076	0.5789	so my workflow:  then if i want to activate that env later i just do  and `exit` to leave the environment; or, you can run a command from within that environment without activating it, just `cd` into the project with a `Pipfile` and you can run `pipenv run -- flask run` to run flask, for example; but i find it easier to just activate the env
	0.0	0.682	0.318	0.4215	Nice, I'll have to check out `pipenv`.
	0.014	0.909	0.076	0.8201	Hey Everyone ! Quick (meta) questions for you guys. I wasn't sure what channel post them so here goes: I recently had my "aha" moment with regards to multithreading and I was wondering if it it's relevant to use such an approach in the context of web scraping (if you have a ton of sites to extract data from) or in the context of database interaction (say you have a csv and you want to insert each row as a row in a given DB) is there any benefit to that ? What's your experience ?; Also, if the main reason for multithreading is to speed things up then why do we use locks (don't they defeat the purpose if other threads have to wait for locks to be released before proceeding ?) Thanks in advance for your clarifications
	0.0	0.88	0.12	0.7964	<@Gwenda> because threads can share the same memory. If two or more threads try to modify a list, for example, you can't predict the exact order of modifications. Thus you need a lock to make sure such mutable shared memory can be modified by a single thread at a time.; If you don't share any memory, then you don't need any locks. But in that case you actually don't need threads - you need multiple processes
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.5081	ah very interesting point !; so if memory access is not an issue then multiprocessing is more suited ?
	0.16	0.753	0.086	-0.3919	It really depends on your actual use-case, but in general - yes.; The whole point of having multiple threads is to avoid expensive communication between isolated memories, by having a shared memory.
	0.0	0.633	0.367	0.5399	ah I see now ! Makes sense; thanks <@Collette>!
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.4019	I am looking to plot time series data for multiple data values together any leads to do so in python?
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.4404	Morning, Just wondered if any has any experience with a good method to cleanly terminate all threads with Ctrl C on a script using multiprocess pool map?
	0.164	0.836	0.0	-0.6908	isn't ctrl c the same as the kkill signal?; If you have the thread ids you can just send a kill signal for each id; via bash
	0.15	0.85	0.0	-0.6956	havent done a whole lot with Multiprocessing with python I have tried the normal try except with KeyboardInterrupt: but it just kills the current thread I assume; as it just continues
	0.15	0.85	0.0	-0.3566	You have to find the root id, otherwise it will keep spawning more processes no?
	0.166	0.748	0.086	-0.363	Yeah it just continues I've tried a few stackoverflow posts but cant find a good answer for it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	using the following code, how can i convert  to js?: ; i currently have 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Toby> convert to... js? You mean json?
	0.524	0.476	0.0	-0.296	no, js, javascript
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.0772	You have a similar data structure and you want to re-implement the algorithm in javascript?
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.296	yeah, ive got the rest of the code changed, i just cant figure out the 2 `M = ...` lines
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Toby> <https://repl.it/N5Na>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how come i get `=&gt; undefined` logged at the end?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I suppose that's what `console.log` returns
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i get 4 logs from 3 console.logs tho?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	 ^ 4 logs  ^ 3 console.logs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`=&gt;` is simply for showing you what have been returned from the script; It's not what `console.log` prints.
	0.309	0.446	0.245	-0.1477	ah ok, so just ignore it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Which tutorial you're using to learn javascript?
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4404	<@Lory> if you work with dates, it's probably good idea to convert strings to `datetime` objects, and manipulate them instead of strings
	0.044	0.925	0.03	-0.3612	I initially had taken that route but the data I am pulling dates out of comes form a few different sources as strings. I figured the date time approach would work in a more predictable environment rather than here where I am conditionally modifying specific pieces and at times reusing the same data for new results. It get's converted after this function returns when I am ready to do my db inserts; would you have a suggestion as to how to constructively build a date with arbitrary y/m/d information using the date time method? I am not too familiar with how to use it correctly so I may have had a bad implementation
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	<@Lory> sounds like a job for <http://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.2023	on the top of my head I don't have any idea to check both condition
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.7717	Fair enough. I have a tendency to look too much into optimization lol. I'm going to dive into those date formats and see how that goes
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.1406	well you could do a function but if the check is only a line or two long it's not necessary
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Exactly what I was thinking, it would just take from the readability of the code
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	depending on the conditions sometime having a 4 branch if/elif might be more readable but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Quick question... What does the line "Global E" (Line 6) do in the following code snippet?
	0.0	0.84	0.16	0.2732	as I recently found out, that allows you to create mutable global variables
	0.122	0.878	0.0	-0.2057	It doesn't create them, it says the global is mutable from within this function.
	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.2732	Well in that one it is in a comment; so it doesn't do anything
	0.176	0.78	0.044	-0.5994	Which is something you generally want to avoid doing in a production level piece of software. I personally cheat when writing test scripts to work out a specific function
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.2235	correct. commented or not makes no difference when I run the snippet.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	They are probably indicating they are using the global E.
	0.279	0.721	0.0	-0.357	<@Meghan> E has not been created beforehand so does get created there.
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	And yes, there is rarely a reason for it.
	0.067	0.933	0.0	-0.0772	actually you are right sorry; it gets declared later - this is just the person saying it is the global E
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.2732	<@Virgen> without `global foo`, `foo = something` creates a local variable `foo` instead of modifying the global one
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That isn't really later, since the stuff outside of the function are executed before the function.
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.5719	I think I understand. So, if I were to expand on this initial snippet and wanted to use "E" later on, outside of the function, I would need to use the "Global E" to change the Global variable.; without the "Global E", the value of E would be unchanged outside of the function.; correct?
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.6369	If you wanted to modify it in some way yes, otherwise if it is simply a reference variable like a file path or something that you do not plan on modifying, then you do not need `global`; you only need `global VARIABLE` when you plan on modifying that data structure, which as everyone says, shouldn't really be done
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In that snippet, in that function. Is "E" getting modified? Or is it being used to assign the users input to "string"?
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	here is a good SO post on it.; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693385>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in which case, "string" is what would hold that data that would get used later.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And in the code given, E is not modified; it is assigning the users input to `string`
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.4215	it isn't it is simply being referenced and saved in the variable `string` which is local to that function and therefore mutable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so even more of a reason that "Global E" is unnecessary.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mutability is a different thing....
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep
	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.7621	got it. Thank you all!; and, <@Vada> I'll check out that SO post. thank you!; <@Lory> how did you format the snippets in your posts?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and <@Vada> is correct I didn't mean mutable, just that it is local and you can assign new data to that variable. mutability has to do with 'identity'  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types>  and how do you mean <@Virgen>, your formatted code looks the same as mine as far as I can tell
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Virgen> <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
	0.054	0.946	0.0	-0.4019	The problem I am finding with this is I don't know how to then modify the `day` if I need to later on in my code depending the `has_day` flag I was showing off earlier. Would I have to convert it back to a string, modify it and then reconvert back to date time?
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4404	<@Lory> I meant the small bits within your replies. `like this`. which I have now figured out is back ticks. thanks <@Meg>
	0.078	0.723	0.198	0.4574	<@Virgen> ah, sorry didn't realize you meant those. Glad you figured it out though!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I believe you can do `date.day = 1`; but you'll need to test
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.3612	<@Lory> anytime date/time/day anything like that shows up, I immediate ask if they've check out the arrow package, if either for implementation or for source code analysis <http://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
	0.0	0.738	0.262	0.4926	Thanks <@Seema>! I'll look into that as soon as I can
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`data_point` must be a list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why can I use :”; for enrollment in enrollments; if enrollment[‘is_udacity’]:; "; enrollment here should be a list too?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uhm, enrollement is a dict, apparently
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh! so unless i define the “data” as a dictionary, i can only use data_point as a string?; and based on my code now, what do you think i should modify it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	remember, you can access a list by index.  eg `some_list[3]`, but a dict has to be accessted by a key.  eg `some_dict['some_key']`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yup yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, you need to iterate over a dict; are you using python 2 or 3?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	3; do i add: data={}
	0.0	0.654	0.346	0.4019	what you want is `for key, value in enrollments.items():`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, enrollments is a list of dicts?; and for some reason, in `udacity_removed`, it gets moved to a regular list
	0.0	0.904	0.096	0.6369	yes enrollments is a csv file; OrderedDict([('account_key', '1304'), ('status', 'canceled'), ('join_date', datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 10, 0, 0)), ('cancel_date', datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 10, 0, 0)), ('days_to_cancel', 59), ('is_udacity', True), ('is_canceled', True)]); OrderedDict([(‘account_key’, ‘1304’), (‘status’, ‘canceled’), (‘join_date’, datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 10, 0, 0)), (‘cancel_date’, datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 10, 0, 0)), (‘days_to_cancel’, 59), (‘is_udacity’, True), (‘is_canceled’, True)]); like this
	0.193	0.643	0.164	-0.1027	I don’t think so, <@Antionette>, because the original error comes from `non_udacity_enrollments=udacity_removed(enrollments)`

	0.094	0.846	0.06	-0.2247	yup, that works as well. If I recall correctly, this one uses closures, but I'm not sure about differences between performance/usages of partial vs closures
	0.0	0.981	0.019	0.3612	Hey folks. Take a look at this project: <https://github.com/datamade/census/blob/master/census/core.py>. I’m thinking about ways to make it more intuitive based on what it’s trying to model. For example, `acs5` and `acs5dp` are two different methods of `Census()`. But the class associated with `acs5` (`ACS5Client()`) is really where the meat of the method is, and the `ACS5DpClient()` class is just two variables that replace variables of `ACS5Client()`. Further, what I’m thinking would make more sense based on how the API is organized (see: <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html>) is if there were `acs5.detail`, `acs5.dataprofile`, `acs5.subject`, and `acs5.comparison` attached to `Census.acs5`. How would I go about reorganizing this code to make that happen? I’m thinking it has something to do with adding those methods to the `ACS5Client()` class, but… *TL;DR:* I don’t grok how these classes fit together, or really classes in general.

Flask or Django – I’m assuming I’ll be able to do this with Flask or Django?  I’m also using sqlite3 as the database – There may be many people looking at this page, but only ever 2 people editing. Will be small edits, but the likelihood of to people committing items to the database at the same time are very slim. Should this be alright, or should I be switching to something like postgr..Mysql, etc

	0.0	0.766	0.234	0.6369	79 is a good default. gives you a single character to wrap up with; embrace the `()`s for continuations and breaks
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.1901	I like that too, it's a project I don't manage but people use PyCharm, that's why I was trying to work it all out.

	0.103	0.735	0.162	0.2023	yeah, what are you trying to do or having a hard time with?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47081717/python-serial-port-ussd-command-throw-error>
	0.058	0.913	0.029	-0.2846	I have a .po file with the translations I want to make, and believe I have my settings configured correctly, but the trans tagged headers in my html aren't being translated when changing the Content-Language http response header to 'es' for spanish.
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.5719	okay, there are a number of steps you might need to take here; first, you need to have a _compiled *.mo* file_ to actually use the translations; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#compiling-message-files>; then you need to change how you're setting the language; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference>; if you're using the request, it looks like you need to change the request header name - I've always used the 'standard' way of having the user make a selection from, say, a form, which sets a session variable for their language choice
	0.093	0.833	0.073	-0.5574	Ah I see, I tried to use the django-admin command, compilemessages, and got this issue "Can't find msgfmt. Make sure you have GNU gettext tools 0.15 or newer installed. ".  I checked with Brew, and I do have the most up to date version.; of gettext; nvm, just had to run 'brew link --force gettext'; Is there a way to just run compilemessages on one locale directory ? When I run it from the root of my app it goes through all my third party directories that have locale files and recreates .mo files for those as well. The problem is that this causes a "plural forms expression could be dangerous" value error because it is re-setting the plural-forms variable in some .po files
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don't think there is, but if you really need to compile only a specific file I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it with other tools; Django's tooling here is mostly porcelain around the gettext toolset
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i tried running the file in terminal i didnt get anything

	0.079	0.764	0.157	0.5305	any thoughts on best practice for variable names during a for each loop in python?  for i in items:   for item in items   i kinda want to use ‘v’ or ‘e’ and just stick with it all the time, but nobody is doing this so i assume there is a reason for it?  i really hate for each loops lol, i like standard for loops
	0.0	0.882	0.118	0.539	uhm; I really don’t care, tbh.  as long as its obvious what is the variable and what is the data structure; and the data structure name is appropriate
	0.0	0.634	0.366	0.8313	yeah, and I gotta say, I’m actually a huge fan of the plural vs singular thing.  I think that adds more clarity, not less
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.7269	for example, `item in items` is pretty easy to figure out, because one is plural and the other is singular; then, when using `enumerate`, I do `for idx, val in enumerate(some_data_structure):`
	0.199	0.635	0.166	-0.017	yup.  also, in general, probably not worth overthinking; if it’s generally clear what’s going on, and there are no obvious problems, then it’s good to go
	0.116	0.884	0.0	-0.4389	inevitably you’ll be back there in a couple months anyway and go, “geez this is total crap, who wrote this!”  *runs git blame* “oh”
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what I usually do I name list with a plural so when doing `for i in my_list` I can use the singular; `for message in messages`
	0.098	0.786	0.117	-0.0772	that’s the thing though, i don’t want to have to rename shit later haha, i’d rather just stick it as some single letter constant and never think about it again in my life
	0.106	0.894	0.0	-0.2263	always using the same letter for indices will get confusing sometime; what if you have two loops ?
	0.0	0.785	0.215	0.8126	then i would give them descriptive names; but that case is rare enough that i don’t care, and i think in that case it actually adds a lot of value to be descriptive
	0.065	0.863	0.071	0.0516	i’m mostly talking about 1 level deep loops no longer than 10 lines. they come up all the time and i don’t think a descriptive name adds any value to the code at all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then the convention is to use `i` and `k, v` for dict
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4019	I use i, j and k,v when the values are non-obvious, as you describe.; specific names otherwise
	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.4404	having written a good bit of c++, I often use 'it' which works for 'item' or 'iterator'. or sometimes I just use i, j, k or x, y, z in nested loops. It's mostly just style since the loop items/indexes are very local and not 'in scope' after a dozen-ish lines or less
	0.097	0.851	0.053	-0.7261	Alright now I really don't know what's going on with this bash script if anyone can help out. If I specify a `-d` option, then my output file variable is an empty string which breaks on the `mkdir -p`, if I don't specify the default holds correctly but then `convert -size "${w}"x"${h}" canvas:"${color}" "${out}"/"${img}"` fails because it can't open an image? even though that command doesn't open an image and is instead creating one? Am I just going crazy?; Actually I fixed it, changed `while getopts "dc:" opt; do` to `while getopts ":d:c:" opt; do` was all I was missing; you're missing a closing `)`; look at the end of `print(random.randint(min_income,max_income)`; should be `print(random.randint(min_income,max_income))`

	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.4926	Wooo my first Taco! Thanks <@Johana>; bash scripting question, anyone ever use the ImageMagick command line tool? Trying to center one image over another and getting mixed results
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mixed results how; horizontal or vertical offset working?
	0.099	0.832	0.07	-0.5023	I was getting incorrect dimensions but I am just now realizing that I had the order of images wrong so I was overlaying the background on top of the foreground image, and since it was transparent it just looked like nothing was happening; this is just a simple script for making images square, it takes two optional arguments, a color for the background (defaults to transparent) and a name for the output directory (defaults to `square_out`)
	0.31	0.69	0.0	-0.4019	Any idea why I am getting that error?

	0.126	0.874	0.0	-0.7579	<@Mitzie> plenty of options: you can replace `sys.stdin` with a custom file-like object (for example, `io.StringIO()`), you can mock `yourmodule.input`, or you can mock `builtins.open`; I would either go with replacing `sys.stdin` or exclude logic into a separate function, without calling `input` and test this function instead; as I expect `input` to be tested by the python testing suite
	0.0	0.541	0.459	0.6239	<@Collette> okay thanks! let me look into this
	0.096	0.904	0.0	-0.3491	I'm using six to provide py2 and py3 compatibility, but I'm not sure I understand this behaviour: Python 2:  Python 3:  could someone explain it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is because of python3; in python2 bytes and str are the same; in python3 there are unicode strings and bytes and bytearrays are different
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	<@Porsha> does something like this make even sense? 
	0.107	0.815	0.078	-0.0772	<@Mirian> I could be wrong but I do not get what the point of doing this is?; six is for py2/3 compat, so you test for the two possible values of `six.binary_type`; and then proceed accordingly; or maybe I am missing the point
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	In Python 2, `binary_type` is equivalent too `str`, in Python 3, it's `bytes`. They're defined and behave differently.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Porsha> I've simplified this example, because there is a for loop there:  I expect the body to be `b'0'`, `b'1'` etc.
	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.6124	uh yes; then your above solution should work, I thought you were using `six` in some other way

	0.146	0.366	0.488	0.6808	Cool, this should hopefully make implicit encoding errors harder. :)
	0.08	0.855	0.066	0.2996	Are you sure you don't just want text strings in both cases?; Then you probably want to generate it as a string, and encode it at the point of call with the appropriate encoding?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Dexter> if you need to access s3 you should be trying to use the boto3 library.
	0.0	0.253	0.747	0.7096	haha, that’s a good point.
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	wish they had something similar for st3 ..
	0.205	0.795	0.0	-0.6597	It upsets me that we now have libraries to fix typehinting for other libraries; without actually bringing those changes into the problematic library
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there a specific channel for OpenCV projects, or should I ask here?
	0.0	0.417	0.583	0.6369	here is probably best

	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.504	hmm; so, does that url require any kind of login?; or is it password protected?
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.6369	nope….; and when the script is running, there’s a cv2 window that’s open, and it shows the feed from the camera perfectly; it just never seems to detect any faces
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	interesting
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.6369	and when i switch the feed to be my webcam, the exact same application works perfectly

	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.1531	what I suspect is the feed from the IP camera is different in some way from the web camera; the cv2 window showing the feed probably knows how to handle the difference; but the face detection script doesn’t

	0.0	0.774	0.226	0.765	I like pycharm, and think you would get by fine with the free version; and as far as conversions, you would have to dig in the opencv documentation for that
	0.032	0.968	0.0	-0.0572	if you don't want to jump into an IDE right this moment, you can also insert python debugger statements and debug on the cmd line, if that somehow sounds preferable to you; otherwise, I second <@Meg>'s vote for pycharm

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hey guys question. when defining a class, why does it need to have `self` in the methods?; for example:  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`self` refers to the instance that's calling the class method
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why does show(self) need to be that way; Got it
	0.105	0.816	0.079	-0.128	it doesn't _have_ to be `self`, either; `def show(this):` works just as well; but you'll get weird looks
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the `why` for that is convention; coming from java, where `this` is the same as `self`, and is implicit to classes, was a big context switch for me
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and the fact lots of java devs really _like_ that they can omit `this`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also different from javascript in that `self` never changes what it points to. it's always the instance
	0.0	0.625	0.375	0.7351	yeah that’s something I like about Python - things like are usually more explicit, there’s less magic
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we keep our magic contained inside of underscores
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.1531	heh
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.5672	I wonder how it would feel to find code where the author doesn't use `self` but something completely irrelevant; like `banana`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have come across code where the author used other things than self, and it was jarring to say the least; it at least vaguely made sense

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hello guys! any recommendations in dealing with time series data that has one insertion each day? I am currently using postgres and django
	0.0	0.88	0.12	0.5187	Hi all. I'm trying to write a loop along the lines of `for number in numbers`. Sometimes numbers will contain multiple values and be a tuple `('1', '2')` but other times it may just be a single number. When it's just a single number, python is splitting the number. Ie: 12 becomes `[1, 2]`. Does anyone know how to work around this issue?
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.0772	you'd need to detect whether it's a number or tuple first
	0.043	0.882	0.076	0.2732	     # Parse parameters     for param in sys.argv:         if param.startswith('event='):             event_ids = param.split('=')[1]              # See if we have multiple event ids             if ',' in event_ids:                 event_ids = event_ids.split(',')      for event_id in event_ids:         event = misp.get_event(event_id)         print event ```  The problem is that if it's a single value (ie: 21) then python will split the string and instead loop over with a value of '2',  and then '1'.
	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.4019	you can use split on a string to get a list even if theres nothing to split on; ; so just always split the `event_ids` string and you'll be able to iterate over single or multiple values
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.4926	<@Marcie> spot on! That's now working as expected. Thanks very much.
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.3595	yup!; <@Sharika> are you able to select that element in the chrome devtool if you turn javascript off?; that's what i'd reckon yeah; if its not being rendered serverside then that react-root points to it being a react component and thus won't exist in the DOM without splash

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so I guess my first question would be, does this work without compression?
	0.067	0.774	0.159	0.7113	Yes.  It feels super hacky, and I'm not sure BytesIO is what I ultimately want to be using, but it works.; Everything I'm reading makes it seem like I should be using StringIO, but then I get a 'bytes' related error (after removing all the obvious byte things I'm doing in that snippet); Or maybe TextIOWrapper? That seems more like for loading from a file on disk rather than a stream
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you could look into temporary files; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html>
	0.185	0.815	0.0	-0.2057	Doesn't that create temporary files on the disk potentially?
	0.103	0.814	0.084	-0.1372	and is cleaned up after you close; so if you create it within a context manager, eg `with open(temp_file)`, it cleans up when the block finishes
	0.03	0.914	0.056	0.2584	Is a potential option, except we don't want to write anything to disk at all unless we really have to.  Mostly because with RPi's will burn out the SD card with constant read/writes which normally isn't a problem with most applications

	0.081	0.744	0.175	0.4404	Hi guys, somebody have already did iterations about the values that are in the keys of redis ?; I've some messy values that need to cleanup
	0.048	0.811	0.141	0.7783	As a followup to my earlier confusion about streams like `io.BytesIO`, when does this stream "empty" out?  I found myself reusing the same stream object over many iterations of a loop, but wasn't finding any issues even when using `seek(0)` about data being duplicated.  I'd rather be safe than sorry, but I'd like to understand it's behavior a little more
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as I understand it, when you do `seek(0)`, it moves the pointer to the 0th byte of the stream.  so when any writes happen, the bytes before that get overwritten; but conversely, it also means the bytes after still exist
	0.08	0.842	0.078	-0.0527	So what i'm doing currently is: write to stream, seek(0), then send that stream somewhere else (like azure blob in my case), then repeat for the next thing in my list using the same stream.  I'm not currently getting any duplicate data, but it feels wrong.  I think I'm going to switch it so it's using a fresh `BytesIO` object each time, since some initial googling tells me that making a new stream is just easier than worrying about reusing an old one
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	makes sense
	0.091	0.909	0.0	-0.4767	Mostly it feels wrong because the next time I did seek(0) I would expect to see duplicate data (the stuff from the first iteration of the loop, plus the stuff for the current loop)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because the old stream will be garbage collected when all references don’t exist

	0.385	0.615	0.0	-0.3612	pure function with one argument
	0.17	0.83	0.0	-0.5423	the lazy way would be `delete_func(instance=foo)` and in `delete` just discard `instance`; of do an `if` / `else` with `delete_func(foo)` `delete_foo()` depending of the case

	0.189	0.766	0.046	-0.7818	hmm; so, what I suspect is the root cause is calling `reg.register()` in a `print` method; because as the documentation says   &gt;All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print>; so what I suspect is the `str()` call is evaluating `reg.register()` first, before the actual arguments are evaluated

	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.3612	Is it printing anything from the statement on line 12?; But you probably would need to do `len(d.entries)` instead of just `len(d)`.  However the more "pythonic" way would be to just iterate through the links instead of indexing; like `for entry in d.entries`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's not printing anything from either print statement, but it was working prior to wrapping it in a function
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Did you double check the length of `d`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I just changed that to "for entry in d.entries" and it still doesn't print anything.
	0.04	0.96	0.0	-0.264	Hmmm if you print d.entries before line 9 what is in it?; Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the library if that's the issue but assuming that `d.entries` is enumerable and contains some elements then print statement inside the loop should be executing; So just try iterating over d directly instead of entries?
	0.027	0.875	0.099	0.5859	I will try that; Tried it, didn't change it. At this point I'm just gonna say screw it and write all of the loops to append to my URL list  (since I have 4 RSS feed URLs) instead of doing it the 'right' way and using a function.; Thank you for your help.
	0.047	0.905	0.048	0.0561	So, at work we have a lot of apps/services each with their own `.env` files, a few repos have multiple. So naturally some of them have the same env variables. Which, can get convoluted. We use salt to set all the ENV's when deploying on production/staging but locally, its kind of a mess.   What do you guys use, if any, to keep different versions of ENV vars in sync between apps based on the environment (prod, staging, dev)? I was considering proposing something like consul but not sure if theres anything simpler. It should be something that all the devs could easily setup and use.; those getting mixed up seem to be a reason some people have issues running some of the apps locally rather than using staging

	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.7311	Hey Peeps, Have a question, I am parsing some json which looks like the following:  This is stored as a simple list containing multiple dictionary objects. From here, my next step is to find an algorithm of some sort that can traverse through each title key in each dictionary and find similar or exact matches. If there are more than one matches or similar titles, then put the matches into a family, eventually yielding a set of family objects containing the matched tiles. With this in mind, if I execute the json listed above I expect to return:  Where both sets A &amp; B contain dictionaries where the title key values can be found by a) finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and b) finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately. I am thinking of incorporating an adaptation of some fuzzy matching algorithm, such as the Levenshtein distance Algorithm, but feel I could make this a lot simpler, does anyone have any alternative suggestions or ideas for me to look up? Would appreciate it greatly.

	0.0	0.963	0.037	0.6288	Hey guys, I got a quick and probably simple issue at the moment. I'm writing a program to process .pcapng files to look at the packet data. The program has time frames which are given a timeout time. This timeout time is checked every time a new packet is read. The issue I'm having is, the .pcapng `timestamp` gives a pretty long float value which equates to a date obviously. For some reason, even after setting the timeout to also be a float, the loop goes a bit further than it should. The first packet in the timeframe sets the next time frame variable so that when `next_time_frame &lt;= timestamp` (this is the check I do every time a new packet comes in) a new next_time_frame is set and a I do other things. So for example if the first timestamp is 1385856000.00000, then `next_time_frame` would be 1385856060.00000, but for some reason, the loop doesn't stop when that statement is true.; So basically comparing two floats to each other isn't working properly; Nevermind it works now.

	0.077	0.894	0.03	-0.5106	I see that some people say here that you should convert the password bytes to a string first; Or using BYTEA; "I had a similar problem and I solved it using BYTEA data type at the Postgresql. I think problem occurs while writing byte array into VARCHAR datatype in Postgre. This might be related to database encoding and the details of that conversion from byte to varchar."; Could that be it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I use db.String(64) or something; algorithm is bcrypt too
	0.0	0.574	0.426	0.6369	Storing as bytea would almost certainly be more efficient.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Joann> even if `bcrypt(something)` is a string?
	0.191	0.556	0.254	0.2006	Unfortunately, not all client libraries make that very easy.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's my usermodel; Then I have a db.py file
	0.0	0.721	0.279	0.6369	leovp: well, you'd ideally want to have it be a binary string since that's going to be smaller than a binary-string-encoded-as-text
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and for making heroku work:
	0.065	0.837	0.098	0.1531	<@Joann> that's true, but unfortunately even low-level `bcrypt` returns a readable ascii string (or a bytes object, but still 2x the size); and other higher level libraries just use what they have been given; <@Carroll> looks ok, you really have to debug the issue itself
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yea
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i.e. what is the issue exactly?
	0.141	0.859	0.0	-0.2411	I'm not sure, when I try to run this snippet; I have an endpoint /register
	0.228	0.772	0.0	-0.4515	your app complains about the password, or sqlalchemy? or underlying driver?
	0.078	0.828	0.094	-0.0772	leovp: which is terribly silly, really.  Still, you could at least save on-disk size by having the data type be a bytea and then sending the base64 or hex-encoded string to PG wrapped in a conversion function to turn it into a proper bytea.
	0.172	0.828	0.0	-0.4404	It hits the exception block; What message can I get out of e?; e.message wouldn't work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	str(e), repr(e), anything really
	0.213	0.63	0.157	-0.1779	Alright; Will deploy it and see what problem it is
	0.041	0.777	0.182	0.7664	Wouldn't help with network traffic since you'd be sending the hex-encoded string over the wire instead of the binary data, but saving space on disk and in memory is certainly valuable from a database perspective.
	0.381	0.619	0.0	-0.3532	otherwise it's really not clear
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(the function you'd use for storing the data into a PG bytea would actually be 'decode', 'encode' would be used to pull the data back out)
	0.046	0.803	0.151	0.3919	<@Joann> I guess no one in Flask/Django/etc world sees it as an issue, because a password column is rarely even 10% of a table size. Maybe top players like Instagram do care, but I don't know
	0.135	0.865	0.0	-0.4215	eh, it just grates against me when people store binary data as text because it's such a waste of space.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The gitlab folks have made an effort to start storing their git hashes as bytea's because it really does make a difference in space.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I understand you entirely :))
	0.401	0.461	0.138	-0.6124	oh my god; I think I get it; -.-; I'm a freaking idiot
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I changed the length of the db model; But never actually reset the heroku postgres database; ......; Any of you got a rope so I can hang myself?
	0.0	0.594	0.406	0.4767	leovp: With enough rows, every byte matters. :)
	0.0	0.685	0.315	0.5574	well, I'd probably recommend ip4r there; Though it depends on your requirements.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Let me just google it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Joann> is it in 10.0 or 9.x?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	leovp: <https://github.com/RhodiumToad/ip4r>; It's an extension that works with lots of versions of PG
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see. It's a bit harder to pitch
	0.0	0.813	0.187	0.6297	Unlike inet, it segregates ip4 vs. ip6, but it's much more efficient at storage and allows more indexing options
	0.163	0.837	0.0	-0.5423	I don't think INET is that bad currently, as we don't really perform operations on IPs frequently (or at all)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	(an ip4 address is actually stored as a 32bit unsigned integer..)
	0.0	0.519	0.481	0.9489	well, or you could store ipv6 addresses as ip6 :); but, yeah, definitely something good to know about; and it's quite stable and well maintained.
	0.117	0.844	0.039	-0.5574	Okey; <@Suellen> I'm really new to this crypto approach; This worked fine; Register now works; But, if we look in auth; Without encoding both, I got an error saying they must be encoded; So I encoded both with utf8, and I got this error message
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4215	hm; where is this exception from?; `bcrypt.checkpw` returns true or false
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Exception is from the auth
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	leovp: no, PG would store an ipv6 address as an ipv6 address
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Carroll> since you are doing utf8 going into the db, you don’t need to re-encode it after pulling it from the db
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	leovp: You could have different tables rather than different columns, though it depends on your exact data model, of course.
	0.172	0.828	0.0	-0.4019	It raised an error when I tried to do that; Maybe I have to decode it?
	0.058	0.814	0.129	0.4019	leovp: I will note that storing NULLs are basically free unless you're careful to not have any NULLs at all in your tuples.; (in which case, PG can avoid storing the NULL bitmap at all)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> I need that u?
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	No you don’t need the u, that’s just demonstrating it’s a Unicode string 
	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.6124	leovp: eh, they actually are disjoint tho, really, but if it works for you.. :)
	0.063	0.716	0.22	0.5927	Sorry trying to get a snippet over but I’m in the middle of switching trains :)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hehe; I am using Heroku with Postgres though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you still encoding the password before putting it in the dB?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I am
	0.0	0.552	0.448	0.743	And did you clear out the original hashed value that wasn’t encoded?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I did this
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	And just to check you redeployed your heroku app with the changes for creating hashes?
	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.9817	Hi, Python newbie here with probably a dumb question...  I am trying to use the Google API examples to get some code running that will send an email from my app since port 587 is blocked on the company network.  I am very close but I am running into some issues where the example code has included some logic for backwards compatibility with python 2.6.    I get compile errors because the syntax is incorrect inside an IF block.  I am coding on OSX with Python 2.7 and my IDE is LiClipse. Here is the code in question and I get an error on the third line from the bottom where it wants "tools.run(flow, store)" to be "tools.run_flow(flow, store)"   Any Ideas for me?; I went to get the compile error to post here and all of a sudden I am not getting an error on that line.  WTF?
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.6124	I guess my first question would be why support 2.6?; the last release of 2.6 was the .9 minor release back in 2013, and it hasn’t been supported since then
	0.0	0.835	0.165	0.7579	well, if anyone is still running CentOS6, they've got 2.6; and it's semi-irritating to load a different version since the OS uses 'python' to run its package updater, and if it's not 2.6, it barfs.; I uh.... have a friend with that problem.... yeah.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why would it not be 2.6?
	0.189	0.737	0.074	-0.3182	uhm that shouldn’t stop you from installing 2.7 or 3.x; just leave system python alone and create virtualenvs mapped to the specific python interpreter version
	0.048	0.859	0.094	0.291	running centos you can use the IUS repository (<https://ius.io/GettingStarted/>) to easily install python versions if you don't want to use the system default one
	0.022	0.925	0.053	0.5514	I am working on simplifying a process that I use a few times a month. The current process is just updating and running a sql query in sql management studio. I am trying to wrap the process in a little python app. So far, what I have works. It is still in the beginning states and I am adding to it. My intention for the final version is that it will, from a gui, request input from the user, use that data to query sql, then dump the result in another gui window.; Am I headed in the right direction with this?; anything I should consider. This is more a learning exercise than anything else. I just hope to get a useful app out of it... Thoughts?
	0.0	0.642	0.358	0.4199	<@Ciera> thx! I'll keep plugging along...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	slightly off topic but relating to centos servers, has anyone managed to setup rdp onto a centos 6.8 server?
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.6486	I am trying to convert multiple pdf files to a text file and then search that text file to find email addresses.; I am able to print the text from those pdf files but when i save it to a file, only one entry gets written.; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Desire> How about <http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/>
	0.0	0.837	0.163	0.7391	<@Sherice> Thanks for your suggestion but I am already able to extract the text but I am unable to save it to a Output.txt, the output of 1 pdf gets written instead of say 10 inside that directory.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>; the `w` filemode truncates the file
	0.0	0.353	0.647	0.6705	<@Antionette> Thanks buddy, that helps
	0.017	0.9	0.083	0.8126	how is pdfminer working for you?; there are two primary issues I have with it, but there really isn’t much you can do about it and really depends on the programs used for document creation; first, if you save the pdf document with an empty password, which happens sometimes with authoring programs, browsers and viewers will open it up, but won’t be able to read it; second, a small number of PDFs won’t be able to be opened at all, whereas they will open fine in other software; that’s my experience when I was processing 16k PDF documents consisting of about 25M pages of content for external text search; about 800 were unable to be processed at all due to those two issues
	0.096	0.862	0.042	-0.5423	<@Antionette> Thanks. Thats what I was trying to do but couldn't get it to work.  I decided to move on because calling it from bash isn't a requirement for today and I'm in a crunch.  When I get back to it I'll post my specific failing syntax.
	0.05	0.834	0.116	0.6435	Does anyone know of any good references for installing a module to pip where I do not want to put it on pypi? I have some local config stuff built into a module and want to build it into pip to make pushing to production easier and more modular

	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.6249	oh cool, that's way easier than I thought it would be; is that process of installing to pip locally called something that I can research into?; I don't have a decent understanding of how that all works and I'd rather learn more about it than just start doing something I don't fully understand
	0.112	0.823	0.064	-0.2187	you're not ever "installing to pip"; pip is a tool for putting external python packages into a place in your PYTHONPATH; i'm not sure of a good resource other than just looking up something like `pip install git`

	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.3818	To be clear, it is currently *the* install tool for python
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i don't see it going away any time soon, especially once `Pipfile.lock` gets locked down
	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.3182	Yea I use it all the time ofr normal stuff within my virtualenv's I just have never packaged anything or gone farther than `pip install xyz`; Trying to take my development ability a little farther and actually understand pythons packaging system
	0.123	0.682	0.195	0.1531	you'll "should" be fine, some of the other flags like -user can also get you in trouble too
	0.0	0.697	0.303	0.7269	`--user` is _usually_ pretty safe, at least on your local machine, assuming you're not using a virtualenv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there ever a situation where you shouldn't use a virtualenv? Everything I've seen online says you should always use one; with the exception of random test scripts at least

	0.192	0.701	0.107	-0.2644	2.7; oh wow, I forgot to put the module name in front. I gotta stop debugging at the end of the day; not sure how I ended up with that error tho
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	yeah that’s a bit of a mystery 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What's up guys. I have a quick question. So I'm processing a large pcap file that so far has gone through 22 million packets. Now at some point the amount of data I need to collect is going to get way too large. I eventually have to store all the data I gather from this on a frontend webpage. Would sqlite be something to use?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong> generally depends on how you're going to be using the data itself
	0.088	0.888	0.023	-0.6442	So the idea is basically upload the data to a frontend (I'll probably use flask) and geolocate them using a database we've been given.; the frontend is supposed to feature an interactive map; Geolocating victims of DDoS attacks that is.; But for now, the file is so large I'm not sure how long it should actually take to go through the whole 8GB file...; So it takes about 1 minute 54 seconds to process 15 minutes worth of packets
	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.2023	off the top of my head i'd probably go for PostGresQL; + postgis
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	I'm just trying to figure out what the tables should look like
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i usually try and put together a few user stories to try and map out my data tables
	0.108	0.813	0.079	-0.5451	<@Marcie> About to put together an example on paper and draw out what might be the best option.; <@Marcie> Just drew this up. I have no clue if this is valid or a good diagram. But it gathers all the information I need; My only concern is how detailed these things have to be. If all they need to be are IPs that map to locations and like 3 other columns of integers then it will be easy cause I can make a single table; So the basic structure that I currently have in python is this.; Actually, realizing the circular reference is gonna be horrible. Scratch that table; Alternatively I could simply remove the Attack Time Frame since I can query the DDoS Victims table for timeframes between a specific time; Guess this problem is a bit more difficult than I thought as far as what I know is concerned.

	0.034	0.903	0.063	0.5106	I'm running into issues with Pandas when combining `.cut()` and `.count_value()` due to bins not actually being present as values in the data.  The snippet below shows a workable example. Basically what I'm trying to get is a simple bar plot:  The OS distributions are shown within percentage bins, and bins should be shown even if there's no data for them. In the snippet I've used `pd.cut()` on the percentage data to get a nice categorical column. I group this data using `groupby` and then I want to get the counts for each OS using `value_counts()`. This is where the code crashes, seemingly because (in the sample data) only 4 out of 21 bins are actually present. The results based on the rounded up data do show that in theory it does what I need it to. Any way I can easily get around that crash?
	0.085	0.851	0.064	-0.3182	Side note: You want to use `==` with strings, not `is`, or you risk some very unexpected behaviour.; Explanation: `is` compares object identity, not equality, so it only works "by accident" in common paths when strings resolve to the same actual string object due to interning, and will break if you get strings through different paths.;

	0.126	0.874	0.0	-0.5994	Ah. I don’t recall installing any - would some python tools (PyCharm, Anaconda, etc) install a virtualenv?; I’ve screwed around with Python on and off over time, and my system has accumulated a LOT of weird junk because of that.
	0.054	0.788	0.158	0.7507	honestly not sure, I would presume they probably do but you wouldn't want to mess with those unless you're also uninstalling the software that uses them; in which case you can probably just use OSX's uninstall stuff to delete the software and they'll clean up after themselves
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I literally only have PyCharm installed - that’s the only Python IDE I have installed right now. And if I recall correctly I can set it to use whatever Python version I have installed.

	0.0	0.859	0.141	0.6412	`.profile` is a UNIX thing, it's not Mac-specific, and it's not exactly equivalent to `.bashrc` in terms of history/what reads it; But unless you care, I wouldn't bother reading more than just knowing that for now
	0.113	0.814	0.073	-0.1184	I legit am interested in getting elbows-deep in the Unix-y bits of MacOS; I’m just not sure what bits are common to all Unixes and what bits are MacOS, which results in some confusion

	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.6486	<@Myong> you should generally keep the connection open but as for sessions, it can vary. depends on if you want to use session vs. transaction scope, or sometimes its kept around the length of a transaction (say, a request on an API); SQLAlchemy has a good writeup of making the decision for scoping sessions here: <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#session-faq-whentocreate>
	0.144	0.818	0.038	-0.7943	Hi, has anyone seen this error `SSL: DECRYPTION_FAILED_OR_BAD_RECORD_MAC` while downloading files with `requests` ?   My work laptop fails randomly with it but not on any of my colleagues'. Now I am seeing it in another computer so I guess it's not a problem of _my_ setup... I've tried to no avail to find where this comes from for some months...  The related, minimized code is:  and the infamous error I get is: 
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	anything obviously unique to your setup like OS or software versions?
	0.134	0.866	0.0	-0.2144	<@Ronny> the error isn't in `requests`, but (much likely) in your system-wide openssl
	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.1531	yeah my guess might be openssl version, but it’s just a guess; also - when you say “randomly” do you mean randomly within the same domain, or for random particular domains (so in that sense, not really randomly)
	0.061	0.891	0.048	-0.3182	Randomly within the main domain...I say randomly because I download about 10-20 files with this code and it fails in a non-consistent manner; sometimes with the 5th or so, sometimes at the first, sometimes not at all; I also tend to favor your hypotheses regarding the specific openssl configuration (btw, it's just a regular ubuntu). At my personal laptop, I tinker configurations here and there and I imagine that I had changed something that I shouldn't have from the openssl or ca-certificates packages However, at this new machine that is now failing as well, I touch nothing, it's a regular Ubuntu 16.04 machine
	0.098	0.902	0.0	-0.264	what do your coworkers have?; also, other things that can affect ssl type things - any weird issues with your clock?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	mmm haven't thought about clock issues before
	0.238	0.762	0.0	-0.3612	<@Ronny> you can tell requests to ignore ssl verification
	0.0	0.801	0.199	0.8016	Hi, I have to make a file downloadable in a wagtail project. The PDF file is uploaded in the admin and then it should be downloadable. If you have a best practice I would appreciate it!
	0.0	0.942	0.058	0.0772	<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification>; use `verify = False` with `requests.get(...)`; what you probably want to use is the geojson serializer; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/gis/serializers/>; or check this out; <https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-geojson>
	0.0	0.809	0.191	0.7783	I am working on a simple program to query a MSSQL DB based on some user input, then display the results in a nice readable format... I'd like to try and front end it with something like flask or django.
	0.28	0.57	0.15	-0.3612	<@Meg> Thanks for the suggestion. I still get the same error when ignoring ssl verification
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.8844	<@Virgen> i think it really depends what you're looking for. django is probably going to be easier to start out with, unless you've already got pretty strong python skills and web development experience with (insert large established framework here). i'd say there's more extensions, more tutorials, a livelier community around django. it's also got some established conventions for how things are done (more or less) and that can help a lot if you've got a team. all that said, flask is great - it lets you build exactly what you want without all the extra batteries you might not need. (but as your project gets bigger, i think you'll discover that actually hey a lot of those things are going to be needed, and you'll end up needing to research and integrate a solution in flask). but, you spend a month building up a flask app vs a django app, and while you'd probably get further on the django app, you're also going to have a much deeper understanding of how flask works compared to the "magic" of django
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.613	<@Jaquelyn> Thank you for the response. I think I might head the django direction. In short, I am looking to get as much functionality as quick as possible. I'm a Sys/Network/Storage "Engineer", wearing many hats means minimal time for any of them. So, with this, I want it to work as fast as possible. If there is some "magic" going on in the background, I am fine with that. I dont feel that I need the deep understanding, I just need to know enough to make it work plus a little bit more...
	0.0	0.763	0.237	0.8402	<@Virgen> I think it’s probably best to ask what you are trying to do, that’ll be the larger determinator of which will help you do the most in the shortest amount of time
	0.067	0.888	0.045	-0.296	<@Junita> I am trying to query syslog info stored in a MSSQL DB. I would like to make a webapp that will request a time range and search string from the user, use that info to query the DB, then display any matching results in the same page.; <@Junita> auth, negative. it will be internal only.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi <@Arica>, which OS are you on?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	macOS 10.13.1
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I only know *bash, but let's try this.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you need authentication?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What happens when you type `which pip` and `which python` into your shell?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you need to paginate the search results?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`/usr/local/bin/pip`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	paginate... not sure...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/python`
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Ok, thought that might be the case ^^
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if it’s just a simple query and display I’d actually say Flask would probably be quicker to get you up and running.
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.5023	I'm not an expert, but it looks like you `pip` and `python` are in different distributions, and that's causing the issue
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.6697	it’s the bells and whistles like auth, pagination, database models, etc where Django can really help you by guiding you in what to do
	0.365	0.635	0.0	-0.3182	Because of a conflict in paths
	0.0	0.472	0.528	0.6792	well that's farther than I got!; Thanks <@Fabiola>!
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.2263	I surprised that it picks up one and not the other
	0.181	0.643	0.175	-0.0258	in the end though I honestly don’t think you can go wrong either way
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do you have a file called .bashrc in your home directory?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does it have a line in it added by anaconda?
	0.0	0.721	0.279	0.8176	If you have any local resources, like friends or coworkers who have experience in either one, that’d be a good way to prioritize which to choose
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	for pagination, I think I would really only need the main page and limit the number of results.
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	something like `export PATH="/home/ogaday/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"`
	0.247	0.753	0.0	-0.5574	no it doesn't; hmm, i may have accidentally removed it; if it was supposed to be there
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	Interesting ^^ I think it's an option to put it there automatically when installing anaconda
	0.026	0.899	0.076	0.5984	hmm... I'm torn. I think I might go with django. I dont have any local resources for assistance. My understanding is that django has the more significant web community.; and, if this is successful, I may start looking for other tasks that I can simplify by building a simple webapp, when that time comes, if I need some of those features you talked about in django, I would rather build on existing knowledge than learn django after having figured out flask...
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3182	Do you want to do a bit of deeper troubleshooting, or do you just want to get on with other stuff right now?
	0.034	0.772	0.194	0.6211	it might, although I’m not sure the difference would be significant enough to matter.; yeah that sounds like a good plan; django definitely has a little more of a learning curve than flask, but it’ll shine when you get into intermediate level stuff
	0.0	0.509	0.491	0.6988	thank you for the info! I do appreciate it!
	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.4325	Essentially: you want to be installing stuff using `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip` instead of `/usr/local/bin/pip`, because the different `pip`s will install the packages to different places. If you try `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip uninstall tensorflow` it should work. And in future you want to be using the anaconda pip, not your system pip, because you're using the python interpreter installed by anaconda, which will look for packages installed in the place the anaconda `pip` uses, which if why you could run that file without trouble before
	0.014	0.884	0.102	0.9366	In the future, rather than always writing `/Users/danilo.../pip` when using `pip` you can modify your `PATH` environment variable so that it points at `anaconda/bin` before `usr/lcoal/bin`; Anther consideration for the future is that when doing projects you can create virtual environments, either using `conda` (<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html>) or virtual envs (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>). That way, each project will have it's own packages and dependencies. So you can use `tensorflow 1.0.0` for one project, and `tensorflow 1.2.0` for another. That way, code you wrote a year ago will still run. It takes a little bit more thought to manage, but it's worth it, in my experience; I prefer `conda`, because it's better for things like `scipy`, `numpy`, etc.  Oh, and I think to fix your `PATH` variable you could put a line like `export PATH="Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin:$PATH"` in your `.bashrc` but I'm not sure. You can try and delete the line later if it doesn't work!; To see what your `PATH` currently looks like, I think you can write `echo $PATH` in your shell

	0.055	0.812	0.133	0.6767	the one cool think is that you can use interactive session to play around; I'm not sure that I can share it as a whole, but basically we had script for sending custom packets and the other script for receiving them. Here's a simplified logic for the listener ; and for the sender part, we were simply creating some dummy packets  and were sending them using `; that's not much, but hope that it helps you get started somehow

	0.025	0.898	0.076	0.5255	Hey all,   I am passively looking for some resources to learn how to make a coding environment open to the web. Similar to how udacity, tutorialspoint, and codewars allow students to type their code into their websites and run it against a test; Welp, I just managed to find this wonderous repo which is exactly what I needed!

	0.056	0.871	0.073	-0.3619	I'm wondering how to more easily manage a list of regexes + functions; I would pretty much want people be able to select which of these they want; it's now unusable because it is in a list of a class; but the other extreme, having to import all these, is also bad; i guess i'll have to make groupings that are logical to "end users" so they'll just have a few boolean flags; though there should also be a way for them to register their own patterns
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.8519	Anyone know how to use the multiprocessing module with elasticsearch-dsl? I am trying to figure out how to create a "Fresh connection" to elasticsearch in a test I am creating that validates concurrency.  <http://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html#thread-safety> ^^ See notes section about needing a fresh connection.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jesusa> maybe have a docs/explanation section that explains the difference between each option, and then put a select box below with the names of each to tell the program which one to use
	0.059	0.844	0.097	0.128	Unless this is deciding what regex a service should use...then I am at a loss of what to do; Ahhh, then I would recommend having each one separated so that they have to specify which one they want to import
	0.0	0.826	0.174	0.8176	Hi,  got what I hope is an easy question…   I am wondering how to find the index position of a row in JSON with out a loop.  Say I have this JSON…  And I want the value for device for net2… Is there a way to quickly look that up without having to iterate through it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nope; unless `net2` is always the second in the list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Patty> so I have to loop is what you are telling me?
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.3612	Yep; unless the `Device` you want to get at `net2` is _always_ second in the list
	0.259	0.471	0.271	0.0258	no I cant say that for sure
	0.0	0.631	0.369	0.4767	Okay, then yep, you’ll have to loop through it
	0.0	0.776	0.224	0.9593	Are the network names unique? If so you can store it as a dictionary keyed to the network name with the value as the device name; And I don't think this changes anything because when you're working with it then its probably a list of dictionaries but as is it looks like valid json besides the trailing comma; Hmmm I'm pretty sure the top level can be either an object or an array, possibly any valid json value as well
	0.044	0.911	0.046	0.0232	yeah nevermind i was loking at something different, i shouldnt be doing like 15 things at once; anyway, my brain being elsewhere aside, to echo <@Antionette> if the network names are unique put it all in a dictionary, lookup is much more performant; (or if the devices are unique)
	0.078	0.76	0.161	0.5574	here's for a fun challenge; make a "datetime.datetime" object that when evaluated in any way always returns a current "now" value; `type(now) == datetime.datetime`; `now.second == datetime.now().second`; it was trickier than i thought; I'll post my version here (attempting to hide spoilers)

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I just found an article with an example and converted it to this and it seems to work but I dont understand why yet…  
	0.046	0.923	0.031	-0.3182	the short version is that 'str' in py3 is a unicode object, 'str' in py2 is a byte array object; if you have a unicode and you want a bytestring, use `.encode(_dialect_)`, if you have a bytestring and you want a unicode, use `.decode(_dialect_)`; and uh, be mindful of what is what, because it is a difficult bug to fix; it appears you need some additional logic to handle url bytes, probably substituting funky characters into % codes and that sort of thing. The idea is mostly the same though

	0.013	0.89	0.097	0.8934	Can anyone help me with a simple question for SQL. I have a table with 3 columns, many of the entries in the table share the same two values for two of the columns. I want to query the database to find all the DIFFERENT or DISTINCT column values for the two columns which many of the rows share.; Example incoming...; Say the above is a table I have with 10 rows, I want to query the whole table and find the different sets of (a,b) which are distinct; So in this case it would return something along the lines of `(10, 10), (13,14), (21,51), (1,1), (2,2), (0,0)`; The following statement will not work on my table even when 100% confirmed that both `lat` and `long` columns of a given row contain the values inputted into the query. `SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; WHERE lat = &lt;value&gt; AND long = &lt;value&gt;;`; And I have no clue why; Hmmm, it would seem it has to do with it, for some reason, being a real number. Changing it to numeric i suppose...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong> the real question ,why do you have/need duplicated data?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Because it's data I had previously and just found it to be duplicated. Essentially just 28k rows of different IPs with two columns that map them to a latitude and longitude. Just so happens that out of those 28k rows there are only 25 or so unique (lat, long) pairs cause many of the IPs are from or within the same subnet; The lat, long pair map are foreign keys to another table which uses the lat, long as pk's
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3612	<@Myong> Something like `SELECT lat, lon FROM my_table GROUP BY lat, lon` will probably work, as long as you don't need to select any other columns.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hey guys sillly question ; For the `load_csv` function, why does it need `=` sometimes for some of the parameters, but for the others(`database`,`self.name`), it doesn’t need `=`
	0.105	0.84	0.055	-0.296	You don't need `=` when it's a positional argument, if you want to skip some parameters you can use `=` to do so
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.7935	e.g.: `def my_func(arg1, arg2=123, arg3=456)` You can call `my_func` keeping the `arg2` default value but changing `arg3` like so: `my_func('value_arg1', arg3=789)`; But `arg1` is always required since it doesn't have a default value (the `=something`) in the function's signature; <@Lilliam>Dynamically in your HTML or before rendering the template?
	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.4019	It's also possible to have keyword only arguments.  So if your function is `def fn(arg1, arg2=1, *, arg3=2)` then you can't specify `arg3` positionally.

	0.0	0.943	0.057	0.5171	hey guys; So i am new to python, I am on linux and i seem to have python (v2.7) and python3 preinstalled; when i open my vscode IDE it tries to install a bunch of things like my linter (which will run the commands against the /usr/bin/python binary and not the v3 one); Am i supposed to change the symlink on my install if i want to use python3?; Or do i have to upgrade the default version? Or what do i do?
	0.048	0.952	0.0	-0.0572	before installing anything you should check out virtualenv; you don't want to install stuff on your system python as it's widely used by other tools
	0.107	0.789	0.104	-0.0202	I see.. so it isolates it for your project; basically like NPM / Composer so you have your dependencies for your project only?
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.7717	yeah exactly; depending on your system you might also want to compile the latest python `3.6.3` so you can learn with the newest; there are multiple tools that can help you with that. I would recommend `pyenv` or `pythonz`
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.4215	so wait.. i dont even know what all those things are yet.. i want to run a python script and now i hear about virtualenv, pip, pyenv, pythonz; pythonz is like nvm?
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.4588	If you just want to run a python script you can easily run it with your system python. Then if you need to install dependencies you should use a virtualenv that split dependencies per project and you use pip to install the modules you need; What you can also do is install other version of python if you want to develop on them. Theses version should be installed alongside your system python because replacing it could cause some bugs for your system
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see.. but what do i point to in my python scripts? #!/usr/bin/env python ?
	0.066	0.934	0.0	-0.482	If you are on a recent linux your python3 version should be at least `3.5.x`. There is now python `3.6.x` but it doesn't changes a lot of things especially if you are a beginner; I believe `#!/usr/bin/env python` is correct but I usually don't put a shebang so I'm not sure
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.34	Well if i want to use v3 for it (any 3.* version should be compatible with any v3 version if python follows semver) So would i target python3?
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4019	if your script only run on python3 yes; usually python without version point to python2
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.5847	I see..; So what is pyvenv? the pythonz docs point to it if python &gt;= 3.3; I want to use the latest version of python.. so definitely &gt;= 3.3
	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.1901	If you build on python3 I personally recommend aiming compatibility for python3.5 and up; but then it can depends on what you are doing
	0.0	0.936	0.064	0.0258	Why does it matter if i use 3.4 or 3.5 or 3.6? Shouldn't they all work with python3
	0.126	0.874	0.0	-0.3491	they are all forward compatible but 3.5 and 3.6 brings new features that aren't supported on older version
	0.069	0.843	0.088	0.1376	that sounds like it is not  forward compatible at all if they aren't supported; That they have new features should be obvious (hence the version bump)
	0.163	0.663	0.174	0.0356	well a new feature in 3.5 is not supported in 3.4
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.6553	Yeah of course; so having in mind that i want to use python &gt;= 3.3; And i already have installed pythonz and my pthon 3.6.2 is ready to go; whats the next step for me here? Do i install virtualenv or venv (Which seems to be the new thing since python 3.3?)
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.2732	you can create a virtualenv with `/path/to/python -m venv path/to/env`; and then activate it with `. path/to/env/bin/activate`
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.466	"/path/to/env" is my directory? like a npm project directory?; and the path/to/python is just any python version? Or do i have to use the pythonz binary path)
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.0772	paht to env is the path to the env direcory. So usually your/project/.env; and you need to use the python executable of the version you want your env to be in
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so in my case pythonz locate 3.6.2
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yep
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.7693	So i did this and it created a pyenv.cfg file and a bunch of folders; So following the docs from <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>; i activated the environment with source ./bin/activate; and now executing the script which was targeting python now outputs v3.6.2; so that seems like a good start
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.2732	And if i change projects i pretty much do the same there but then activate the other project and install stuff there via pip
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.5484	So why did you point me to virtualenv in the beginning? Did you assume i was using a python version below 3.3? or is there some additional benefit of using it?
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.2732	I'm just used to say virtualenv. They are all the same things, it's just the way to create them that changed
	0.068	0.852	0.08	0.1027	ahh i see..; i am getting a bunch of errors trying to pip install things; first of all i installed setuptools using sudo pip install setuptools; and it gives me "Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you shouldn't need to `sudo`
	0.218	0.782	0.0	-0.6144	which does not really sound like it is inside the virtual env?; that gave me a permission error earlier without sudo
	0.0	0.753	0.247	0.3182	and are you sure your env is activated ?
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.222	it says "(python_test) name@name-pc ~python_test $; so it sounds like it is correct; but the fact that it points to 2.7 doesn't sound right, does it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you do `which pip` ?; and `python --version`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but return the correct thing; python_test/bin/pip and v3.6.2

	0.131	0.787	0.082	-0.128	Never heard of it, sorry  But seems like that's an issue with the pyside package. Is there anything in the project repository issue tracker about installation problems?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Lavona> the JSON you've pasted is not complete. It's not possible to know exact cause of the issue
	0.08	0.833	0.087	0.0516	If so, your code is trying to get a value from the key "d" on line 17; There's no key "d" in the JSON you provided
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.4696	ahh so if i make that a child value?; or a key name, keyname being the children values i guess?
	0.057	0.788	0.155	0.5168	not sure if this is a better sample: <https://bpaste.net/show/0629afc935db>; key ‘d’ i guess is because the JSON file starts with d?; if i try another value i get     for entry in find_all_entries(data[‘fileAssetId’]): KeyError: ‘fileAssetId’
	0.0	0.864	0.136	0.296	Yep, "d" is valid then. Can you paste the full traceback (lines above `TypeError` message)?

	0.0	0.924	0.076	0.34	<@Lavona> take a look at your json. `data["d"]` gives you `{"__type": ..., "children": {"__type": ..., "children": {...}}}`; i.e. you need to dive deeper to get the value of the 'content' key

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you see `obj` in _your_ code?; That's what you should pretty-print
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Because you never call `find_all_entries` function, and you never pprint `json_data`; Have you walked through a tutorial?
	0.0	0.893	0.107	0.7269	Okay, pprint.pprint(json_data) displays all the data; under children is all the values; attempting to change it to children as it looks like it shows up under Children; python3 py3jsontest.py Traceback (most recent call last):   File “py3jsontest.py”, line 18, in &lt;module&gt;     for entry in find_all_entries(data[‘d’]):   File “py3jsontest.py”, line 11, in find_all_entries     fileAssetId = obj[‘children’][‘fileAssetId’], TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str

	0.039	0.89	0.071	0.2824	Question; I'm helping someone out with a homework problem, and their teacher/textbook has them naming class attributes with double underscores. What is the purpose of this?  for example we have a class Nation: ; What does the double underscore do here? I know it does something because when I create an instance, I can't access the attributes with .__name; I have to access with ._Nation__name; What is the purpose of this?
	0.029	0.883	0.089	0.9174	__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).  __double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: "magic" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__,  __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.; Not sure if this helps; Naming an attribute in your class self._var1 indicates to the user of the class that the attribute should only be accessed by the class's internals (or perhaps those of a subclass) and that they need not directly access it and probably shouldn't modify it. You should use leading underscores in the same places that you would use a private or protected field in Java or C#, but be aware that the language doesn't actually enforce non-access - instead you trust your class's user to not do anything stupid, and leave them the option of accessing (or modifying) your class's private field if they're really, really sure that they know what they're doing and it makes sense.; I wondered the same thing a while ago. Quite a good answer here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name>
	0.076	0.876	0.048	-0.3612	Based on the assignment, and the textbook, it looks to me like the class is heavily influenced by Java/C# principles that aren't really relevant in python; What is the purpose of "Name Mangling"?; Ah, nevermind. I think I see it here in pep8; To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.  Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named __a, it cannot be accessed by Foo.__a. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling Foo._Foo__a.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.; avoiding name clashes with subclasses

	0.029	0.901	0.07	0.4215	<@Lilliam>I think we just had this issue come up the other day in here. The problem is that you are calling `self.update_options()` before you create `self._optionmenu_b`, so it doesn't actually exist yet even though you are retrieving it in the `update_options` function; The solution is probably one of a.) don't touch it in `update_options`, b.) call `update_options()` after creation of your menus, c.) change your design to not need to do things in that way; to be more specific, line 19 seems to be the most immediate culprit
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.4404	<@Sirena> thanks is there any other way to update an option menu based on what is selected in another option menu?
	0.073	0.835	0.092	0.4491	hard to say without knowing more, but probably you should create some kind of empty or default menu stuff in the __init__ before you call the other functions, as it sits currently you have a circular dependence; so I don't think it's impossible to update a menu based on a menu; but you can't update a menu based on unknowable information for sure; you might be able to just move #19 down to #25 and have it work, there's a lot going on here that I'm not terribly familiar with; I don't do much GUI or DB stuff, sadly

	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.3566	so libxml, ok; have you looked at the example here? <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html>; specifically `find`, `findall`; <https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.find>

	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.4497	That didn't work, but I think I've found a solution; Because I what to be able to find the tag wherever it may be in the xml hierarchy, I need to prepend the XPath with `.//` which means start from the current (root) node and then subsequently search all sub-elements.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uhm, `findall` shoud do that for you, provided you have the correct tag name; &gt;&gt;&gt;findall(match) Finds all matching subelements, by tag name or path.

	0.059	0.85	0.09	0.7479	<@Gerri> I'd find the first unmatched bracket using vim, and use that as a reference point for the other unmatched ones.; the other thing I'd recommend is that if you are having trouble keeping track of your segments within a template it's a good idea to break up the template into multiple parts. You can trick jinja2 into multiple inheritance through `extends`, `include` and `import` which allows you to do things like template segments for header, footer, if say it's a separation aggreement you'll have a section that waives liability of the lawyer on almost every divorce document so you can create a standard template for this. Having a template with hundreds of pages or even 10s could be reduced to 10 templates, each with about 20 sets of brackets that you can easily check for.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`fp.read(numbytes)` won't work; `iter()` expects a function that it will call; `fp.read(n)` returns an integer, so you need to bound `n` to `fp.read` without calling it: `functools.partial(fp.read, n)`; it's the same thing as `lambda: fp.read(64)`

	0.057	0.839	0.105	0.7925	oops, just noticed this thread. I think so yeah, but if you write Europe/Amsterdam, it might return `Europe/Amsterdam` as the timezone rather than CET. I think a lot of those timezone fields are not super standardized so it depends what libs are underneath, and I only really have experience on the Linux side of those libs. No idea what it does in Windows/other. Might be the same, might not. If you're especially concerned about it, you might use datetime to fetch the GMT offset and then convert to time zone codes yourself. If it's not especially critical you can just leave it to the library; you may find this reference useful. It looks like CET is used for standard and daylight both, as is Europe/Amsterdam, and they are the same values for GMT offsets; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>
	0.185	0.815	0.0	-0.8047	<@Sirena> linux here too, and i also considered a GMT offset, but the problem is that I think that's the actual one that might change. maybe if i could mock changing the system time, I could figure it out?
	0.074	0.703	0.223	0.6597	I think that in general it's going to work fine with either CET or Europe/Amsterdam; it sounds like CET is technically deprecated but still supported; and for a trading system, yah you'll definitely want to mock it and check a bunch of boundary cases

	0.056	0.709	0.235	0.9245	<@Corrinne> If you're going to split the dates like this using string slices. You really should validate your `formatted_date` Nate posted a much better way of doing it. I'm not sure how your form is validating the string, and since you can't change that (or stop them from changing) probably best you validate it other than the single input pattern you've seen.
	0.0	0.641	0.359	0.9477	hey <@Glinda>. Thanks for the feedback. Will definitely look at implementing a better solution. The date submitted by the form is from a javascript date selector so should be formatted the same every time. But agree with you I should find a better solution.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Corrinne> also maybe look into storing dates as `dates` instead of `strings`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what DB are you using

	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	yeah; only at the end
	0.0	0.866	0.134	0.6072	can you give an example of your desired processed ?; Something like you're yielding a single dictionary for each `'name': 'value'` pair? `yield {'name': 'value', 'desc': 'multiline combined', 'alt1' : 'multiline combined', 'alt2': 'multiline combined' }`
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How so?; Are you also removing new line characters?
	0.092	0.84	0.067	-0.0516	<@Corrinne> what has worked for me so far is to just store unix timestamps in the database as integers, and then handle all the formatting application-side. this takes care of a single format for datetime, plus no confusion with timezones since everything is utc.
	0.172	0.674	0.154	-0.128	cron?; or a Windows Scheduler if you're on Win; It's easy to start at $TIME1, but a bit trickier to stop the script at $TIME2
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.2732	well $TIME2 can be a param you pass to the script and it shutdown by itself at that time

	0.083	0.893	0.024	-0.4874	Then <@Ciera>’s advice is the way to go. You can provide a command-line argument to this script, which would be, for example, a number of seconds to run. And then you launch it using cron at 9:00 for 7 hours: `/path/to/script1.py 25200`; I'm not exactly sure about cron and graphical applications, let me check
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.7391	yeah cron is easy; but for more complex things systemd timers are nice.
	0.194	0.749	0.057	-0.4767	oh, you can even stop the service after a number of seconds; no need to code anything in the app itself
	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.1531	yeah but then you nuke everything I suppose and don't cleanup; or you would need to listen for `SIGHUP` / `SIGKILL`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	afaik, systemd doesn't really `kill -9` right away

	0.045	0.837	0.118	0.4939	Hey <@Ivonne>. I don't think anyone here will do the work for you. Maybe try to do something by yourself and if you get stuck ask for help on a specific issue.  If you are new to python we often recommend <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>
	0.0	0.844	0.156	0.8176	what I’d do is look at <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>; use that to generate an excel spreadsheet; but your original question… your output is doing exactly what you’re telling it to do; because `dups` is a queryset; how do you iterate over a queryset to extract the values you need to some intermediate object?
	0.0	0.51	0.49	0.5859	well, you’re telling it to use values
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have tried to use values_list, i don't know any other alternatives.
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.6124	assuming you have a loop like `for dup in dups`; you’d access the property with a dot variable like `dup.part_no`, `dup.name_count`; oh, wait
	0.0	0.8	0.2	0.25	I have tried: So i have other reports that i have created
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its a dict set; so it’d be `dup.get('part_no')`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ahhhhh
	0.056	0.815	0.129	0.3818	yeah, because with that one, you’re using the queryset with the actual model objects; with `values`, its just pulling out the field and value alone, and you have to use dict notation
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	writer.writerow([dups.get('part_no'), dups.get('name_count')])
	0.268	0.732	0.0	-0.296	no; because `dups` is a list of dicts
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	thats why i need the for loop?
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.4019	yes; unless there’s some way `writerow` will take in a dict; hmm, you can use dictwriter instead; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/8331638/214892>
	0.129	0.762	0.109	-0.09	help I have 2 counters containing objects but when I find their difference I get an empty counter back
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Winnie> can you show the code snippet?

	0.294	0.706	0.0	-0.3612	don't iterate over already exhausted generators ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but I don't know that they're generators...; my functions took in an items field; but I had items as Counter.elements()
	0.024	0.74	0.237	0.9081	What is the best place to learn fundamentals of computer science and programming I feel like i am missing some things and want to retouch my vocabulary and fundamentals of how things work data memory etc; thanks any free ebooks out there or anything?; I plan on purchasing this though this seems good but do you know of any free material
	0.055	0.844	0.101	0.824	By counter you mean `collections.Counter` ?; Couple of problems I might not be understanding correctly.  1. You aren't sure if you are getting an iterator or a iterable. In the first case you exhaust your iterable when you compare. The second case you can do a good check later.   2. You are always getting an iterator and will always run into the exhausted iterator when you want to use the values.   In the first case you can deal with this by using `isinstance(obj, type)` and the `collections` library.  ; So in the case that you actually have an iterable you don't need to worry about exhausting your iterable. This leads us to how do you deal with exhausting an iterable? Well one way is to create an iterable like a list, but this gets rid of the advantages of an iterable- the returned contents could be really large.; Here's a function that goes over another method that keeps it in an iterable, and lets you deal with not having large memory concerns.  <http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/01/03/be-defensive-when-iterating-over-arguments/>; return True if y else False; 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's making it longer, I know you can do a one line statement for when you have a boolean operation, I just can't remember the syntax for it
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.7443	So you want `single line if else value assignment?`; not single line None checking?; Because if you want to check if a value is none
	0.07	0.756	0.174	0.7655	I don't necessarily care if it is None, I just have a value that will be either True or None and I want to save it as a False or True. Which I know of the classic `y = True if x else False` but I know I've used something along the lines of `y = if x` in the past for boolean operations like that
	0.0	0.875	0.125	0.8225	`small = x if x &lt; y else y`; <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#id23>; ; I think what you're getting at is; I have two conditions I want to check, `y== True`, `y==False`. Now there's other conditions you could have to consider `y == anything else`; Since you know  the value "will be either True or None and you want to map `None -&gt; True` or map `True -&gt; False` Then you only have two actual conditions.; in that case you can do this assignment: `x = True if not y else False`
	0.058	0.786	0.156	0.5414	Yea I mean I understand all that and that's not where my confusion is. I just thought I remember there being some super shorthand way to achieve the same goal but I think I'm mistaking it with something like `x = not y` which is possible
	0.014	0.757	0.229	0.9891	Looks like you can chain ternary operators, but the only case I've seen requires 3 conditions: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2919360/8143102>; `1 if a &gt; b else -1 if a &lt; b else 0`; Now since you want things as short as possible practical advice is that in many cases you don't want one line functions that do too many things, there's the programmer you today, tomorrow a month from now and next year. And next year you're going to wonder why you didn't put this single line into a separate function. Name the function something like `def is_value_None(input_value)`; It looked like he wanted to map `True or None and I want to save it as a False or True` True =&gt; False, None =&gt; True; `y = not bool(x)`; Any suggestions on a way to reverse enumerate that is better than these options- replaced with file; `first` is better due to preserving original index, but not sure I like the `list(....)` part.; I kinda like this `third` wrapper
	0.268	0.732	0.0	-0.296	no need for `list()` conversion in `first()`
	0.0	0.674	0.326	0.4404	I think, if it works, `enumerate(reversed(my_list))` is better
	0.14	0.86	0.0	-0.3491	reversed is a builtin so it should be faster than consume the `enumerate` iterator; but not sure
	0.0	0.704	0.296	0.6369	`TypeError: 'enumerate' object is not reversible`; yours is best, <@Ciera> :))
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.296	yeah it's something I discovered not to long ago. You can define a `__reverse__` dunder; if not it will consume everything and then reverse it
	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.3182	But now the index doesn't correspond to the original index.
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.2263	`y = bool(x)`, however in almost all cases just using `x` is what you want.  You usually don't want a `bool`, you want something that is "truthy" or "falsey", and x already is that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`reversed(enumerate(my_list))`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I am trying to write a code which involves these two lines; In this case, is the array traversed twice or once and is there a way of combining these two statements?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	twice
	0.156	0.741	0.103	-0.2565	Hi, I am trying to install a python library using PIP on my macOS sierra (10.12.3).. using pip install vspk command .. it’s throwing an error as:  could not create error: could not create ‘/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/vspk’: Operation not permitted  … I have python 2.7.10 version installed on my system.. any help would be appreciated …
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> then is there a way to reduce it to one traversal?
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.1531	<@Arla> if you want a single line, you can look up zip, ex: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9826867/python-values-of-multiple-lists-in-one-list-comprehension>  But if you want the most readable with a single loop:

	0.038	0.828	0.135	0.6172	<@Arla> not sure what your motivation to replace these 2 lines. Please note that constructing a new list with list comprehensions is usually (much) faster than iterating and append. //cc: wmont  The difference will be even more pronounced if you have huge lists and append will cause memory reallocation.
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.3612	<@Moses> sounds like you need to call pip with sudo because you don't have permissions to write to that folder.; possibly it's a sign that you didn't set permissions correctly when you installed python

	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.3818	Sure: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>; or you could just make a dict where a key is an ID, so that you can narrow down from 8000 to a way smaller number of entries in O(1) time
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yah, that was sorta where I was starting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and then iterate over (lower, upper) and check if it's in range; and if it is - you got it

If I populate the list from a file the sort works sometimes, but not others.; Trying to help a friend who's learning to code (I realize there are some inefficient and unnecessary things in this code); But I'm a bit stumped. The data coming from the files seems to be identical to when it's hard coded.; In the results (truncated) I see: ; Is it gremlins? Because I think the problem is gremlins.; `index_of_smallest = randomList[i:].index(smallest) + i` Fixed

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Thing is, with Googles data, you can only store it for 30 days, according to the tos ; You can use openstreetmap's nomatim service, but that's iffy at times 
	0.138	0.862	0.0	-0.3415	thats kinda annoying for the latitude and longitude; the distance thing would be on the fly
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.5043	<@In> I was curious about the same thing.  Google "geocoding api" and have a quick look at the link below.

	0.103	0.657	0.239	0.4404	<@Devorah> could you print the values of `grocery_item['number']` and `grocery_item['price']`? I suspect one of them has value `'cost'`.
	0.0	0.643	0.357	0.6124	<@Devorah> please remove `'` around dictionary values  in the `grocery_item.update...` line.
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.9109	fantastic, that is now printing the proper values; I'm trying to create a dictionary from inputs and then store it inside of a list, but what's happening is that the last value  store in is writing over all the other entries in the list.  ; by removing .update from grocery_item I'm getting it to create the dictionary in the list proper, but still it's not adding up correctly.; When I run this   It's only returning the last value for in grocery_item in the grocery_list. Why is that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Devorah> Could you provide the entire piece of code? (maybe with python syntax on...)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Devorah>; You define `x` in a loop, but never actually use it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`if` and `elif` meaning is different. An `elif` case is evaluated ONLY if a precedent `if` conditions turns out to be false
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Instead, `if` is always checked
	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.6249	in your first solution, both `if` conditionals can be true and you can have `i` inserted twice
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; Instead `number` and `price` are taken from `grocery_item`, which is the last  added item; So if you have 5 items, you're going to calculate a total sum of the latest product 5 times

I did achieve the task.. but how is it normally done, for example I have some url patterns I already created for the app..     and then I added the last two apis for json response of something similar to what the first two urls would output in html, since I have seen api usually having such names for versions and stuff.. I know i am doing something wrong. So how are they actually separated or are they not? apis and html urls.

	0.024	0.911	0.065	0.5345	<@Lashell> Yep, a few of us do, what’s up?; So you want to use lambda to host a proxy for all of the calls?; You’d have to set up a proper trigger, probably with an API Gateway (<https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>) but if this is going to be proxying every call, the lambda is going to be called a lot, which is not going to be cheap; Depending on the load, you are probably better off running a small instance on EC2 or whatever you prefer to host the proxy; but if its low enough load, it may be cheaper for the lambda, depending on how long that lambda takes to run
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I don’t expect the calls to be too frequent. But I think you’re right that it would probably be cheaper using an ec2 instance.
	0.0	0.792	0.208	0.2732	Well, if it’s light enough, then it’s not cheaper
	0.0	0.912	0.088	0.3612	Just don't try to setup lambda manually. Use a framework, like serverless (<https://github.com/serverless/serverless>); I had to do that once, for two dependent functions, using cloudformation, and it was a nightmare

	0.045	0.87	0.086	0.3135	Hi quick question…  I want to run a python script from cron to add/modify entries to the /etc/hosts file on Ubuntu, daily.  I have never been good at reg ex and struggling this this simple code.  I admittedly googled this syntax and don’t completely understand it.   Result  Original Contents  So it looks like its finding the section to replace but not replacing the start and close tags. I’ve been playing with it for an hour and cant figure it out.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	have you considered dns instead?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so the pattern is `r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)'`. what does that pattern do, as you understand it, <@Season>?
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.5514	um, I don't think new_hosts_data is defined inside the re.sub function?; this is pretty convoluted, would you be able to transmit a diff and then use `patch` to apply it to your /etc/hosts?
	0.055	0.945	0.0	-0.2144	its there and sort of working, I jsut must have a problem with my regex because its putting the data inside the file but not replacing the starting and ending tags.  so it replaces   With 
	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	it seems to me like new_hosts_data already has the tags, so you're inserting them between the literal tags in your regex; that's just a guess
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4019	yes that exactly what happening.  I just cant figure out how to fix it
	0.065	0.879	0.056	-0.3291	; you'll fix it with; `new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; if you want to keep the new_hosts_data tags; if you want to keep the literals but throw away the new_hosts_data tags, then I'd suggest preprocessing new_hosts_data to drop those lines
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does `#StartStoreLocations` or `#EndStoreLocations` ever change?
	0.115	0.885	0.0	-0.296	<@Frieda> no; <@Shavonda> that worked except it wiped out the rest of the file with the new data
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3182	? you said the original file only had 3 lines; at least in your example
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.0772	I simplified it. there are other entries in my hosts file.  I want to update those.
	0.0	0.915	0.085	0.3612	if they never change, make them non-matching groups and only replace the parts in between; at it is now, it looks like you're always copying them back in
	0.12	0.826	0.054	-0.7391	thats why I was placing the entries between those tags.  here is my current code with your tweaks  ; <@Frieda> agreed,  thats what I want to do but I am literally brain dead when it comes to regex.  I cant figure out the syntax, which is why I posted here.
	0.117	0.883	0.0	-0.6141	if new_hosts_data has the tags, just do: `new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; I personally don't really like that `.*?` because it's slippery, so I might change it to `new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations\s*(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`; but if you like it, it's sorta personal preference
	0.059	0.8	0.141	0.4854	can even drop the perens around `(.*)` since you're not using the backrefs any more, but I think they make it easier to read
	0.09	0.635	0.276	0.792	<@Shavonda> works PERFECTLY  thanks!  Now I need to make sure I understand it.  Ive been coding off and on for 20 years and regex has always made my head hurt
	0.063	0.861	0.076	-0.1154	yeah, I wrote a decent bit of perl for like 4 years, but there's a reason people sometimes call regexes a "write only language"; if you write some guru stuff and don't come back to it for 6 months, you might have no idea what you did
	0.114	0.732	0.154	0.6534	yah, I sorta recommend against it. I don't know where your input comes from or anything, but as a cron job you might just consider transmitting diffs around and apply them using `patch`; it's a pretty well established and understood format with tools built around it; in your case, your format is pretty straightforward, and hosts files already have a format that generally will avoid any weird regex problems, so it probably doesn't matter
	0.067	0.824	0.109	0.3979	Anyone have an example (for the front end mainly) of a way to organize a bunch of different reports? I want to make them easier to find, but I am not sure what I should use for it; Also, I am not opposed to solutions that need backend work, but the primary goal is to make it easy for end users to use
	0.131	0.845	0.024	-0.8443	Yeah, I've been using that work around, but it's just not the best option simply because it leaves room for a man in the middle attack; now I don't think that will happen but it's always possible; And you can follow the link to make it so you dont have to specify it every time you do `pip install ...`; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45337029/pip-conf-not-paying-attention-to-trusted-host>
	0.143	0.799	0.057	-0.4939	it's for me always a bit difficult to determine when "all" will return a generator and when it will be evaluated; (to get short circuiting); the problem with all being of course that bool(generator) will be True; I guess I'm just bitten by an empty generator

	0.068	0.848	0.084	-0.1674	Hey guys! Can someone help me. I am new at Python and I am stuck on this script for 2 days. I have script (<https://gist.github.com/2filip3/bd8d0f26491572c1cce355e9f7e0d366>)that monitors folder and notifies me when files are changed. I want to notify me on email but I don't want my email to get spammed because the file changes every 5 sec. So can som1 tell me what change to make in script so I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED so I would know my script has stopped. Thank you!; It supposed to be running on server 2.7 Python
	0.098	0.902	0.0	-0.4448	I don't understand; <@Ivonne>  You &gt; notifies me when files are changed but also &gt;  I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED; can you clarify?
	0.018	0.919	0.063	0.5574	Yeah sure. Script I am running is monitoring my folder. In that folder i have files tar.gz that are being updated every 5 sec. In my script I get notifications about every change that happens in specified folder. Now, because I wont to get those notifications on email, I need to rewrite script so it doesn't notify on every change because my email would be spammed. I need to modify it in the way that notifies me ONLY when files in specified folder are not being changed/updated or created so I would know when my other script(that is making those files to be updated) has stopped working.
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.6322	are these like rolling log files?; do you maybe only want a notification when a new file gets created?
	0.0	0.815	0.185	0.3612	Sounds like he just wants to be notified when his script crashes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Could just put an atexit handler on the script
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What happens if the host crashes?; Not saying it's relevant in this case
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	then the script-monitoring script probably went with it; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; need a little more specifics if we're going to go down this particular rabbit hole
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.4215	I think it might be easier to use a process manager to monitor the first script; than check if files are being created/modified
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.1531	depends on how the first script typically stops working
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I need to monitor files, not script guys.; Script can be runing but the server that are downloading files from can be busy or at full capacity so my files wouldn't get updated and changeed; I just need to modify script which i've put above in the link so it can notifies me when the files are NOT updated
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.4215	sounds like you should define the files you want to be notified of updates with a unique prefix or suffix; and your script will check all modified files for that; if it matches, send an email
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I am monitoring whole folder, and i can get notifications on every change. Now I just need tomake little change to notifies me when the files are not changing but I don't know how to do that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	use an interval
	0.0	0.87	0.13	0.2732	are you certain there will not be any files there which are _normally_ not changing?

	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.3612	yah, just stat the files and check for update times more than X seconds old; ; something like that
	0.0	0.86	0.14	0.7184	Well I think this is helpfull but before this I would need to make a function that states whenever the file is created it should be added in the file_list so I can iterate within it. Right?; I was more looking to find some simple solution to modify watchdog; script above

	0.05	0.838	0.113	0.7811	<@Cecille> the problem from transitioning from anaconda to pip is that you're going to run into issues with numpy/ pandas.; conda is great for installing those packages.; And it's really not difficult for someone who has experience with python to do it, but dealing with the binaries _while_ learning python and wanting todo data science is probably the biggest reason I see people pushc onda.; If you have a student id, you can get pycharm pro for free and they are working their darndest to steal that data science money from spyder/ conda.; Give me a second, I want to see if the new changes make it easy to deal with numpy/ pandas in a windows
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.3291	yeah it made me realize that it may be forcing that positional arg in, feels like it should be a kwarg but hey i didnt implement it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.4215	nice job; Do you use windows 64 python 3?

	0.019	0.957	0.023	0.1335	So basically I have an excel file I'm generating; Now the response from the GET I make to this API send me XML with a bunch of nodes that have child nodes; I grab the text from the child nodes in the order which it appears; But in some cases the data doesnt contain every node which the header contains; so say the header covers 38 columns cause it can contain 38 different pieces of data; Sometimes I only get 35 from any given node; so I'm missing data; But I wanna insert it under the correct header; so I have a list of headers and the headers are the "id" nodes which are always included in the response; I also store each different main node as a dictionary, and place the dictionary in a list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you show an example of the response?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I can not actually
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Even just the header list with id, and another row list of id.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I cant do snippets on this computer; I would just post my code if i could
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.264	snippets?; Do you not have `` key?; So since you say order of nodes matter you get the header data first right? So can you get the key from each header item and use it later to match the column from the rows of data?
	0.0	0.944	0.056	0.296	Yeah basically I have all possible headers and theyre in the proper order; I put the masterlist of headers and also the current headers for the current set in a `set()`; then I take the difference of one set minus the others
	0.0	0.75	0.25	0.25	Any chance you tried to use a dictionary?
	0.057	0.65	0.293	0.7003	Without seeing your data and what you want to happen, or code. It's pretty hard for me to help more.
	0.0	0.68	0.32	0.5719	Yeah I know; But I think I know the issue; if there are like 3 keys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Explain why you are using `set()` to filter?
	0.0	0.712	0.288	0.5009	with set you can use `set1 - set2`; so like
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	set doesn't preserve order
	0.0	0.918	0.082	0.6555	I reorder it; with filter; `filter()` based on index of headers; but the issue is this; just realize; when inserting into a list with different size than the main header list so like inserting into a size 35 list based on indexes of size 38 list; So if I have `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` as a main list
	0.132	0.868	0.0	-0.5267	It seems mostly to be an issue when two missing cells are next to each other towards the end of the list; and there is also a missing cell towards the beginning
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	This will also work: `map(lambda x:x if not x in list_2 else None, list_1)`; ; Actually that works. forgot the not
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.5661	<@Myong> So you're receiving XML, and ultimately you want to build a spreadsheet with it? I'm assuming you're generating a csv file that you're opening in excel, is that right?
	0.0	0.767	0.233	0.4497	Yes, I can do pretty much everything but there is an issue with formatting it correctly
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	It seems like you're manually generating the csv yourself.
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.4939	Have you tried <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter>; If you can get the XML into a dict, you can throw each one into a DictWriter object and it will take care of everything for you.
	0.113	0.887	0.0	-0.2584	you can even specify a restval to fill in gaps where you don't have a value for the field.

	0.0	0.902	0.098	0.3612	Like in node and express you use app.get/app.post then the url after the server url, isnt there a sinple way to do this in python?

	0.0	0.47	0.53	0.7845	Well their home page is nice haha, looks very node/express-y
	0.088	0.912	0.0	-0.4404	<@Tangela> when you use the `with cursor` context manager it closes the cursor after the code block; so you need to move all `cursor.execute()` statements to be within that context manager
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.6124	sure I can help, let’s take it to <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be in the right channel
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.3612	you would need to use the equivalent of something like requests which is aiohttp.

	0.306	0.694	0.0	-0.296	What exceptions are you worried about?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	string too long and invalid chars...
	0.0	0.916	0.084	0.4767	You kind of have a lot of things happening in this single statement.; What do you want to happen when you encounter 1. string too long, and 2. invalid chars?; Also can you paste the code here, I'd rather not retype most of it the images are helpful.
	0.0	0.897	0.103	0.4215	1. When encounter a string too long I want inform the user that string is too long for store it on db, 2. The user cannot store on column emails invalid characters like /, *,&amp;, %, etc.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Are you using python &lt; 2.7
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm using 2.7
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.6523	Okay; So I split your system into three parts.; So now you have a single location where you might have an exception `db_cursor.execute('INSERT INTO {table_name}s({table_name}) VALUES {row}'.format(table_name=table_name, row=row))`
	0.0	0.911	0.089	0.1901	Thank you very much <@Glinda> I was using try..except in everywhere but with your code was reduced to 3 at least
	0.113	0.748	0.139	0.2598	I see, from now on I will write more generic functions, I usually don't do that, later I got lost in the errors, py2.7 should be discontinued so maybe better try the most actual, there huge differences between it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Probably the biggest thing you'll notice is in python3 print is a function `print('string')`
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.4019	The `key` should be a function.  <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions> might help you.
	0.0	0.726	0.274	0.8067	ok, but len is a build_in? i will read and contemplate.; thank you <@Gisele> i've learned a lot on this. Solution is very compact ; even shorter with this; `

	0.031	0.852	0.117	0.7331	Hi guys. I am working with Celery, and it’s pretty cool. However, I would need a way to communicate with my application and I was thinking of nameko due to the wide range of communication protocols.; I am still in the learning mode, so I am not sure if it is a good idea or not; how do you usually provide your application with a communication layer; that can be rpc or pub/sub?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	From what I know most of the times people try to use redis to store celery result
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Or rabbitmq, those are probably the 2 big backends
	0.086	0.789	0.124	0.451	oh yes, if you need to store results  you can use a few backends service. However, my questions is about the integration of the two project.; Let say that the main business logic of the workers is made with celery.; but I need to expose a public api; and I don’t want to use flask or some other REST api; oh well, I would like to use something different than that; something more message oriented.; I am not sure if combine together the functionalities of nameko and the logic of celery is a good catch or a bad idea
	0.073	0.868	0.059	-0.0772	you want to expose an API over the network other than HTTP ?; nameko seems to be over http or AMQP
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	yes. I am trying to integrate it with AMQP
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	<@Alexa> you are probably missing a conversion from json string to dict; json.loads(your_str)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I have that in my code ... ; A = json.loads(json.dump(xmltodict.parse(xmlstream))) this my conversation code; After this I am trying to iterate using for loop 
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.296	<@Jacki> i don't know if i understood your question. Are you worried about using nameko and celery in your service, because both are over AMQP protocol?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Alexa> why are you converting to json when you alreayd have xml to dict conversion?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg>  i am not able extract data from dict.. also  
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if I read your code right, you’re converting xml to a dict, then to json string, then load that string it as a dict; what do you get when you do `type(xmltodict.parse(stream))`?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> let me check

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in your snippet "i" is one of the keys of a dict; and it's not possible it's a dict, because dicts are not hashable by default (probably OrderDicts are, but idk); (and dict keys needs to be hashable...ofc)
	0.0	0.786	0.214	0.9388	<@Wade> yes, I was wondering if it is a good solution in terms of performance and design. What I would like to have is an agnostic adapter for the APIs side of the application. Moreover, I’vent found that much about nameko and AMQP. Do you have any good example how to use it with Redis or Rabbit? Thanks a lot ; <@Tangela> could you show what kind of data your CSV have? 
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.5267	<@Wade>  got it but it is not the key.. in dict let me ping the full code then u guys will get the clear idea ..

	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.3612	<@Jacki> no, i'm sorry. I've not used celery or nameko. I only heard of them and look'd at their API some time ago
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I use celery alot, but not with nameko; celery tasks are integrated with django apps, so I call them through regular django HTTP API calls
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.8126	That won’t prevent SQL injection, you’re putting the values directly into the query without sanitizing them; <http://bobby-tables.com/python>; though it depends on which database module you are using; Also, a small thing, but it’s a lot easier to share code/output on here with snippets or code formatting with backticks instead of screenshots
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	`psycopg2` supports other dialects?

	0.0	0.565	0.435	0.6597	So, maybe should be better using a ORM like SQLAlchemy?
	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.8338	Realistically you should be using some type of framework that makes it so you don't have to write out the sql statements. I like sqlalchemy, but my experience level is like maybe a total of 50 hours. Some people here can provide you good alternatives.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	#sorry
	0.0	0.773	0.227	0.8023	I used SQLAlchemy some years ago, was my first touch with a ORM, I guess will not be problematic try to implment,  anyway better that use pure sql statements. Thanks <@Wade>  <@Patty> <@Keneth> <@Glinda>
	0.079	0.64	0.281	0.9759	<@Tangela> if you are adventurous enough, give a try to peewee. A simpler and smaller ORM, but yet powerful enough. I've been using it with Flask and I love it.; it has extensions for some of the most used databases, and it's quite awesome. The author, owner and maintainer helps with doubts on Stackoverflow quite quickly.; anyway, there's no problem using SQL sentences, if you need them. But the DBApi2 interface supports parameters, which sanitizes the input for you for the values, so things like SQLInjection are less prone.
	0.0	0.777	0.223	0.4877	<@Keneth> +1 for peewee. I tried it and was so smooth and easy
	0.199	0.725	0.076	-0.4767	Hi ... I am new to django and I keep running to migration problems like `django.db.utils.DatabaseError: ORA-00904: "CORE_COMMAND"."HIGH_RISK_JUSTIFICATION": invalid identifier`.  Is there a trick in trouble shooting these sort of issues?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this oracle?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.212	0.707	0.081	-0.6099	what happens when you google examples of that error; not sure how oracle handles it, but invalid identifier seems to me its a bad type or null value when there’s something expected
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.7003	oh its pretty clear that the column high_risk_justifitication does not exist in the core_command table.  But the the django core/model.py references that field.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	did you make a migration?; a new one, that is
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and I have done the makemigrations and migrate
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is the first in the migrations?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	about the only thing I can think of is there’s some sort of migration out of order.
	0.111	0.889	0.0	-0.1877	or one didn’t generate correctly and the SQL may show the field wasnt being created
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is this a new column name, or is it being re-used from a previously deleted/renamed column?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	There is a migration file that adds so I'd say it s new column
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.34	do you set a default value for the field?
	0.144	0.527	0.33	0.5086	would zapping the pyc files help at all or be a disaster; I'll check for a default value; nope no default value
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.7543	ok, if the field is not nullable, that’s a bad thing; because if you’re changing a db table by adding in a not null field,you need to specify _some_ value to be inserted
	0.071	0.815	0.115	0.3147	what I’d do is remove `null = True`; <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/07/25/django-tip-8-blank-or-null.html>; &gt;Now, where most developers get it wrong: Defining null=True for string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. Avoid doing that. Otherwise, you will end up having two possible values for “no data”, that is: None and an empty string. Having two possible values for “no data” is redundant. The Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL.
	0.0	0.756	0.244	0.6369	would that fix my oracle ORA-00904 issue or is that just a best practice suggestion
	0.08	0.796	0.124	0.3612	best practice; because I really don’t have a clue why that migration error is happening; if you run `manage.py migrate --list` do you have any unapplied migrations other than that one
	0.095	0.788	0.117	0.25	cool thanks I'll try that; turned out that my django db user does not have privs to drop the tables before running my tests; so I had to log in via sqlplus as more priv'ed user and drop the tables
	0.167	0.571	0.262	0.25	interesting.  too bad the migration errror didn’t give more detail about that…; nice find though
	0.045	0.955	0.0	-0.1139	after an `os.fork()`, from a a child process, how do I pick up from the parent process when the child calls `os._exit(n)`? I don't want my parent to wait on the child because I need to fork a few times, I just want to be able to poll for when all child processes have completed and then continue execution from there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there any way you can refactor from fork to use suprocess instead?
	0.065	0.895	0.041	-0.3409	That's the eventual goal but I'm trying to understand the root basics of forks and inter process communication before I use subprocess to hide the details; That and I tried it with subprocess first when I initially wrote the code but failed and ended up running everything in serial instead because it was simpler and faster to develop, but now I have time to go back and learn more about it so I'm starting at the very bottom; It's easier to learn when I can see the actual forks and exits and everything happening within the code itself

	0.093	0.907	0.0	-0.5621	It doesn't quite work like that in Python. You write a script, execute the code and you can display output using the print function, either in your terminal or an IDE. It doesn't just output on the fly. Try a simple editor/ide like IDLE, which comes bundled with Python
	0.0	0.703	0.297	0.886	Ok Julian I got your point ; My friend also suggested me to improve my logical skills in programming; Apart from programming skills how did you improved your logical skills ?; Any tips
	0.066	0.843	0.091	0.1999	Some understanding of logic, specifically symbolic logic, is good for any programming language.; But I'd probably not recommend a new student rush out and sign up for a course in it.

Here I am getting  '_mysql_exceptions.ProgrammingError: (1064, "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '['<http://00author.com|00author.com>'])' at line 1")'; db_cursor.execute('INSERT INTO {table_name}s{table_name} VALUES({row})'.format(table_name=table_name, row=row)) I know that's a good choice use in this wat because of SQLInjection. However I prefer deal with after
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	When I used other approach previously, worked perfectly...
	0.085	0.831	0.084	-0.0134	<@Tangela>: You should never do it that way; it's actually usually simpler to do it without a `.format()`.; And it's not just about SQL injection attacks; you have to quote the values correctly just for the query to work correctly at all, in the first place, so you don't have problems like the above.
	0.139	0.701	0.16	0.0772	<@Louis> I know that's dangerous, I am just using this way because is I'm trying to find the error point so I did simple just to debug easier.

	0.0	0.851	0.149	0.6315	<@Tangela>: Well, it's not just dangerous; it often just won't work at all. :); Python string escaping just is not the same as DB escaping.; If it worked before, it only worked by accident.; What's the actual data you have, and the query you want?

	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.5803	<@Tangela>: Okay, so according to that, your CSV is a single column, not two, so the query should be `(%s)` instead of `(%s, %s)`.; Your query has to fit the structure of the data you're inserting. :); Why do you have `{}s {}`? That doesn't make sense.; You should only have the table name there.; What are you passing in as the `table_name`?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why are you trying to make a method private?
	0.0	0.865	0.135	0.4215	The method is only helpful for that class and not any other classes, so I think it should be private.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's my understanding that the "were all consenting adults" philosphy means if it' works without making it private don't make it private
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But can you do the patching while keeping it private?
	0.046	0.954	0.0	-0.1232	not sure about the patching, but if you do prefer to mark something as an implementation detail and not relevant to anybody else, prefixing with a _ is the pythonic way of doing that
	0.12	0.88	0.0	-0.3135	it could be that by marking it private, it's preventing the patching from not working, because you're trying to access a private method.; I'm not really sure

	0.0	0.754	0.246	0.8316	Should I be trying to subclass logging to create a new `logger.new_method` call if I wish to have a separate logging name for different types, or is there a better way of specifying specific events go to certain files?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Glinda> use different handlers, <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-advanced-tutorial>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if I use `<http://logger.info|logger.info>('some thing')` it works, should I be using `logger.new_member('some thing')` to access this new handler?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You need to have two logger instances: `logger = getLogger(__name__)` for general-purpose log messages and `new_event_logger = getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')` for "new_member" log messages; And you configure "info_file_handler" to work only with your "my_module" logger, but "new_member_event" handler - with "my_module.new_member" logger; Then `<http://logger.info|logger.info>("...")` goes to, say, "info_file_handler" handler and `<http://new_event_logger.info|new_event_logger.info>("...")` goes to "new_member_event" handler
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So I have that working. But I think I'm directing the output to console somehow. 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's because you also configured "root" logger with all handlers
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's because it's not finding the config file

	0.0	0.953	0.047	0.144	So <@Blaine> You want to take in a single string with and split it on spaces to see if there's multiple words?; Now instead of splitting them why not check if you have a space;

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What do you use in order to communicate to Celery?; do you use rpc or rest api?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Celery is generally running on redis or rabbitMQ
	0.0	0.926	0.074	0.2144	yes; but, let say that you have to send tasks to the application where celery runs; i was wondering how to you communicate with it

	0.423	0.577	0.0	-0.296	no; only backend services
	0.0	0.736	0.264	0.5106	ok.  I use django, which integrates well with celery; so you have your `tasks` module
	0.0	0.83	0.17	0.3939	Can you expand on “communicate”? Are you looking to send tasks, receive them, etc?
	0.028	0.919	0.053	0.3527	let say I have a serviceA which has tasks to be consumerd; consumed; and let say that serviceB is my Celery application in charge of dealing with tasks; how I can request to serviceB to run tasks?; so, in other words,; how do you expose the APIs of the serviceB; ?; <@Patty>, yes i am looking to send tasks
	0.044	0.956	0.0	-0.0772	makes sense.  what I do is each django app’s celery tasks are integrated with the exposed api for that app; where some POST requests explicitly trigger one or many tasks
	0.118	0.806	0.076	-0.2263	ok, but what if I do not have django but just a stand alone backend application; that just does one job
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just follow the regular celery documentation; should be the same; that would handle executing tasks
	0.181	0.718	0.101	-0.3018	oh well, is what I am doing, but still something it’s not that clear
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you mean?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	moreover, I have to put that application into a docker container, so; I need to communicate with that service
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uhm, I think you’re not entirely understanding of what celery is
	0.032	0.9	0.068	0.431	i am pretty new to Celery, but this is my structure; ‘’’json; docker-cluster-with-celery-and-rabbitmq   -- test_celery     -- __init__.py     -- celery.py     -- tasks.py     -- run_tasks.py   -- docker-compose.yml   -- dockerfile   -- requirements.txt; so, I am able to run tasks, such as sending emails; but, my question is, do I need to integrate Celery with django or I can use it; in a stand alone application adding a layer of communication; like, RPC or REST or whatever; and use it just as a distributed task Q
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.6204	hmm, ok.  So to be clear, celery consists of three parts: worker, broker and task; you’ve already written up the tasks; and you apparently already use rabbit to handle the task queueing
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	Can anyone recommend a library for grabbing an address from coordinates?
	0.0	0.969	0.031	0.2287	the worer is completely de-coupled from everything, and just listens to messages from the broker; geocoding?; so you have that cluster and communication, <@Jacki>; thing is, tasks are highly specific, are they not?; you can use OOP and task classes to create levels of inheritance, but in the end, a task is highly specific to the thing it is supposed to do
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.2263	true; but still, if i have to send 100 email to 100 users; I have to communicate the array of those 100 email addresses
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.296	no
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh,
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.2846	well, yeah.  but not exactly; you have the data from your backend service; you post it to your rabbit broker; and the workers pick it up
	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.6369	<@Jacki> do you _want_ to handle sending emails to users? that can be a mess and end up with your email server running into all kinds of problems when it starts getting blacklisted. if youre looking to move this up to production-level i’d integrate with an external mailing service
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.6597	and I suppose it’s the same with Redis; <@Patty>, yes I already have an external mailing service where all the stuff; and basically yes I have to send email mgs as result of some actions
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, long story short, you can indeed make a service layer of sorts to handle the task calling and execution; question is, does having this explicit layer make sense in your overall application and project structure?
	0.0	0.692	0.308	0.7906	well, yes because I can only send a payload to a serviceA; and I don’t have to take care of broker; or other technology stack
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uhm you _do_
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	serviceA will be in charge of
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	because you need that for celery
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do whatever he wants to do
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or for any kind of asynchronous task queue
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.4019	oh yes, serviceA has celery and use Redis in my example; and he has a public endpoint; just to receive the work to perform; is that make sense?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What I get from you is Service A is a backend service, and you need it to pass off async tasks to celery workers.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	@http(‘POST’, ‘/api/email_dispatcher’)           task = tasks.send_email.delay(payload_to_send,url_to_call)
	0.047	0.931	0.022	-0.34	<@Ciera> question about slack api. I have two application credentials 1. real slack  2. test slack. I got my application to work using the test slack and now i want to go back and get the `xoxb-` token for real slack. Problem is when I try and use the real slack token it's apparently connected only to the test slack.
	0.0	0.444	0.556	0.3612	something like that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	why not import the task module in Service A and execute it there via   
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is there a universal way to query an API to ask for entries where keys dont exist?
	0.05	0.867	0.084	0.2732	yes is what I did; but,; in my local env; I have one console with the celery worker runs; and another one where I run the serviceA; in order to expose the APIs
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	<@Myong> no, this is something that would only be available if the API implemented it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	figured as much
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but I don’t know how to put those guys into docker containers and then into production
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6486	Pretty certain
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	uhmm; but from an architectural point of view
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I tried it a few times last night, and even reinstalled application
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Jacki> <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/daemonizing.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does it make sense to have a serviceA with a public APIs and Celery?
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	uhm, yes
	0.0	0.862	0.138	0.1531	oh ok, but I think you can put it into a container; but
	0.0	0.556	0.444	0.34	oh, for development certainly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if I can have a serviceA with public API and Celery inside
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but production?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I should have to run the serviceA with python service.py and at the same time; the celery worker; am I right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	correct
	0.0	0.788	0.212	0.6249	so, in the end, Can Celery be used as a standalone distributed task management?; @dd2 thanks a lot for helping me.; @dd2 <https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/dockerize-a-flask-celery-and-redis-application-with-docker-compose>
	0.075	0.754	0.17	0.4144	yeah, I’ve seen that before, and have talked with Ken Cochrane at Docker about this very thing; FWIW, I like that setup for development; production, no
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what do you suggest for production?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so, I I have a 10 servers on AWS; and 12 different queues; workers on celery servers are daemonized, where workers are listening to one or more queues, depending on the task resource requirements, run time, etc; for example, tasks that run in five seconds require fewer resources than tasks with 6 hours run time; then my app API pushes new tasks into the rabbit broker queues
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and what about scalability
	0.104	0.896	0.0	-0.5994	no problem.  Spin up 1 or 10 new servers, map them to the queues required and its hands off after that; then when it comes time to spin down, shut down the worker processes and wait for them to finish executing the currently executing tasks
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	ok, makes sense.
	0.113	0.722	0.165	0.25	once that’s done, the workers will stop listening to the queue, and the broker doesn’t care
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	problably I am using a cannon to shot a fly
	0.0	0.758	0.242	0.6249	if all you’re doing is sending out emails with this, then yeah; much better ways to handle that
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	like coding a queue; and send email using aiohttp
	0.264	0.736	0.0	-0.5106	no, use an external mailing service; because you’re running the risk of being blacklisted
	0.113	0.788	0.099	-0.0941	i can’t really use an external service for policy; so no mailchimp or stuff like that; and I can assume that I won’t be backlisted
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	something like this might make more sense for you; <https://github.com/nvie/rq>
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	I’ll have a look at; thanks
	0.0	0.747	0.253	0.9224	great.; cool, I know how I’ll spend the rest of the day; thanks again; I’ll try to sort it out; but may I ask you why you don’t like the docker solution; for a production env; i mean, docker is strong enough and reliable; is it something related to celery itself ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	just don’t see the need for it; because celery workers are already daemonized; so, why go through the docker layer?
	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.3612	to have a configuration ready to start in different env; you do the conf once, you can repeat everywhere, even localy
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I’ll try your way
	0.0	0.61	0.39	0.4939	that’s pretty much it for me.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	0.74	0.26	0.882	that said, I am going to be teaching myself docker this winter.  It has benefits I can use; but I just don’t see any distinct advantage to containerizing celery on dedicated servers that are wholly responsible for async workers
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.3612	portability is one of the main advantages; your container is not  coupled to your server
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where should I ask questions about test cases for a project?
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.5499	but, yes, I see your point; anyway I am trying to put my celery app into a container; and see what’s going on

	0.156	0.844	0.0	-0.34	does anyone has ever used Celery with Redis sentinels?; it is driving me crazy …
	0.0	0.955	0.045	0.4118	Question: I have a server-side application that automates downloading a bunch of excel files, performs some ETL, and writes them to a SQL db. I have like 30 functions that contain each search (automated through selenium, and the site's HTML doesn't really lend itself to iterating through those searches in a single function). I currently have one master function that calls all 31 functions, but is there a more pythonic way to run all of these searches without calling every function in another function? It just looks amtuerish to me.
	0.124	0.876	0.0	-0.4019	Are the functions just different in terms of the search arguments they're called with or are they actually different functions?
	0.154	0.718	0.128	-0.128	Also, is this a blocking function or are you using some sort of task queue like Celery?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Antionette> They are different functions.; <@Nicole> I'm not using a task queue.
	0.0	0.847	0.153	0.4404	Is there an easy way to wrap a `slackclient` rtm_socket in a flask app so I can host on `pythonanywhere`
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.6124	<@Enid> Running a lot of discrete tasks server-side sounds, at least on the surface, like a possible application for Celery ... especially if the tasks don't have a lot of dependencies.  It doesn't really sound like a question of "pythonic" or not.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Not that I know of but the you could host it on digital ocean 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you know the timezone?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I do, but it be nioce not to have to know it
	0.164	0.836	0.0	-0.2411	you can't convert time to UTC without knowing its original timezone
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	whatever whatever -0600 is; central USA i think; yea lets say its central
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And Celery is but one (popular) approach.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think i got it with this; 
	0.0	0.933	0.067	0.0772	this didn't change the time. You just added the timezone info to be UTC; is that what you want ?
	0.206	0.794	0.0	-0.0772	thats what i wanted; sorry about that
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.7727	I'd probably just do multiple passes to make it simple myself, it also allows you to provide better validation reasons for why it may have failed.; It would be a little more flexible to, as you effectively can make a rules engine:  
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.5023	<@Blaine> I think the look ahead version you posted is close, but it looks like there's also a condition where only alphanumeric characters are allowed which isn't accounted for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	[Is there any way for me to replicate a POST/GET request sent to a java server to generate a query that way I can simply use the `requests` module to do so? Or is this something I have to do with `BS4` or a similar library by entering the data to fill in each form field; I have the source of the form data from the POST in the format `owner_name=&amp;asr_r_zipcode=&amp;radiusChoice=all&amp;fiLatDeg=` and so on. Would I have to pass these form fields to `requests` in the form of a dictionary/json?
	0.093	0.838	0.069	-0.1638	I believe requests would just accept them in the url but not 100% sure on that; You could use this to parse to a dictionary (<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.parse.html?highlight=url%20parse#urllib.parse.parse_qs>)

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It might need to be `asr_r_struct_code[]`; hmmm although the name is just asr_r_struct_code
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	When you say it doesn't select any of the 15 options shown, what do you mean? because none of the params come up filled in for the get request to that page.  Do you mean when you post its not returning the correct/expected results?
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.296	Yeah, in the post request the page that loads up, the parameters which I enter do not get sent
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.1655	oh in your original link you have `ars_r_struct_code` but the field name is `asr_r_struct_code`
	0.0	0.927	0.073	0.2263	On the backend it must just not take in the parameters for the select; okay let me check; Still doesn't take in the parameter; odd...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you post the dictionary that you're passing to requests?
	0.014	0.962	0.024	0.2263	Yeah; `{'radiusChoice': ['all'], 'fiLatDir': ['N'], 'fiLongDir': ['W'], 'fiRadiusMetricType': ['Kilometers'], 'fiHeightChoice': ['all'], 'fiOverallAGLExactMetricType': ['Meters'], 'fiOverallAGLRangeMetricType': ['Meters'], 'asr_r_struct_code': ['BANT', 'BPOLE', 'BTWR', 'GTOWER', 'MAST', 'MTOWER', 'NNGTANN', 'NNLTANN', 'NNMTANN', 'NNTANN', 'POLE', 'TOWER', 'TREE', 'UPOLE', 'UTOWER'], 'asr_r_status_code': ['G'], 'fiDateType': ['asr_r_date_last_action'], 'fiSelDateSearchType': ['fiToFromDateRange'], 'fromDate': ['01/01/2017'], 'toDate': ['12/11/2017'], 'fiFromMonth': ['01'], 'fiFromDay': ['01'], 'fiFromYear': ['2017'], 'fiToMonth': ['12'], 'fiToDay': ['11'], 'fiToYear': ['2017'], 'fiExactMatchInd': ['N'], 'fiRowsPerPage': ['100'], 'fiSortBy': ['registration_num'], 'Submit': ['Submit'], 'jsValidated': ['true']}`; Sorry, I can't do snippets; This is direct output from `parse_qs`; from the raw string input after pre-selecting what I wanted and viewing the form data in the post
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.3612	Hmmm and it looks like the results are filtered correctly per the other params, just not the the struct_code multie select?
	0.087	0.856	0.057	-0.3238	Yeah, it's odd; Let me try; and do multiple selects on the other menu; one sec; Yeah, I guess it just needs to physically be entered. It doesn't pick up anything in those menus at all it would seem.; The request just brings you back to the page to select everything, so I'm not sure what I'm missing; let me try to post again with python instead of just entering the url...
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what url are you posting to? `<http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrResults.jsp?searchType=TRA>`?
	0.066	0.677	0.257	0.6846	yeah; I guess it might actually be grabbing the content; Gotta find the function to pretty print it; Yeah not sure at this point actually.
	0.0	0.976	0.024	0.25	You could try writing the response to a file and then opening that local file in a browser to see if it matches what you'd be expecting; alternatively the title of the results page is `ASR Registration Search Results` whereas the title of the search page is `ASR Advanced Registration Search` so you might be able to do a quick check of that to see if the page is at least right even if its a bit harder to check if the results match what you'd expect
	0.0	0.761	0.239	0.296	Yeah it's the search itself, not the results
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.7003	kk, feel free to send me the actual code your using and I can take a look at in a bit
	0.064	0.81	0.127	0.4091	hello, So lets say we have to process a list and compare every list indice to the next indice like this: if foo(list[n]) == bar(list[n+1):  The way I implemented that in my script (ignoring what the foo and bar actually do) is something like this:; And i feel like it's really unpythonic and bad : &lt;
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	maybe try using enumerate and compare backwards instead of forwards
	0.0	0.858	0.142	0.2475	So you want to compare each value in list to the next one, but you're actually doing `foo(value_1)` to `bar(next_value)`
	0.147	0.533	0.32	0.3818	no, a value needs to be compared only to the next value
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So what is `foo` and `bar` in your syntax?
	0.025	0.884	0.091	0.4143	doesn't matter i think really, i'm just asking if writing code this way is good, actually we could get rid of foo and bar and just compare the values. The code actually works, but i think it could be made more readable
	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	; That shouldwork nicely.
	0.0	0.414	0.586	0.7948	awww this is so nice !; thanks : D
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	replacing `==` with `is` also works for integers and strings
	0.0	0.941	0.059	0.4515	gotta remember that; on a side note; is it normal for a begginer that slowly starts to write code that actually does sometging meaningful, to look at my code and think "this is such a mess", even if it works? Also, do you know a good place where i can show more experienced people my code for review? I know there is a code review subreddit but didn't see much traffic there.
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.9095	1. I can't answer this one, I learned python after c/c++ so even the simple things looked less messier. 2. You can probably show anywhere you want, but there's _sooo_ many things to improve on don't feel bad if you're writing "bad" code. Just keep improving.
	0.0	0.417	0.583	0.6808	trying to, thanks for the help : )
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.1779	To clarify 1. Python looked much cleaner than c++
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.5719	Team,i need some help in running a python script which is on windows via ubuntu machine; i have created a paramiko session to that machine; and when i pass this command to exec command func of paramiko  command = 'cmd.exe /c "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe C:\pythonattempt\try.py"; its not working; can some one guide me here; i have ssh server running on that machine
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you import another python script only if time is in range ?
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	I would start with something like 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but `n/2` not always is int
	0.223	0.637	0.14	-0.3182	oh yeah my bad. you should cast it to an int. `int(n/2)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but still it does not give the intended effect because now `a` is max 12 and as you can see an example, `a` is equal to 15 and in the next tuple 21; a is x; and should check all possible pairs of numbers
	0.044	0.716	0.24	0.6777	I'm not sure what are the limits of `n` are but I think once you reach higher number you need to be clever about it and skip ranges of number.
	0.123	0.786	0.091	-0.4574	Problem has piqued my curiosity! Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, <@Ciera>. Have to think about the mathematics of the problem and find a shortcut so you don't need to compute so much; which for large `n` should cut out a lot of pairs; For instance, you don't need to check pairs where both numbers are greater than `sqrt(sum(range(n)))`
	0.0	0.798	0.202	0.5859	I win a big chunk of time by removing the `list` from  `list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))` as it's not usefull
	0.076	0.924	0.0	-0.3527	What's the complexity of the naive approach? `sum(range(n))` is `n(n-1)/2`, and then by comparing all pairs, you check `n(n-1)/2 * n(n-1)/2` pairs; So the complexity is essentially `O(n**4)`?; `n**2*(n-1)**2/4` pairs to check
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let's say that `n` will not exceed 1k
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	By checking for `(first  &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n)))) and (second &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n))))`, you can reduce that to...
	0.203	0.797	0.0	-0.6808	but anyway, from what I was leaving it, I do not know if it comes `n` to until 1k. I suspect that the max is much lower.
	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.3724	If I'm not wrong, even if n=1000 that still requires checking 249500250000 pairs of numbers
	0.059	0.912	0.029	-0.296	Well, that's a lot. But as I said, I do not think it ever came to n = 1000. I think it's going to be hard to make it halfway. (n=500); for research purposes, let's set it for not more than 300.; not only do you worry about the speed of action. If, for example, I have to check with 50 x `n` where `n` &lt; 100; for this, this function should be as fast as possible
	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.1779	It also depends what is as fast as possible. Maybe there are solutions in C library
	0.0	0.713	0.287	0.8932	Your code earlier looked really nice. On the whole, list comprehensions are much faster than `for` loops, so I think your first answer looked pretty good. Like <@Ciera> suggested, you can remove the `list`structure

	0.01	0.941	0.049	0.9192	Short Question: Is it possible to use a MS Office file as a source to render a webpage with one of the web frameworks? If so, what would you use? (I am looking for a simple yes/no on the possible question. And if possible, just direct me to the package/module and I'll read the docs from there...)  Long Version: Our IT dept keeps our documentation in a bunch of MS office files. It is all quite well organized and standardized. A directory for each area of IT (network, storage, vmware, voip, etc). Each folder has a single .docx, a .xlsx, and a .vsdx. The issue we run into is that we rarely update but frequently reference. Since we all have RW permissions to the files, whenever we open one of them, it locks the file so no one else can edit. So, whenever we have to make an edit, we have to find who has it open and ask them to close it. Its not enough of a bother for anyone else to have done anything about it, much less be willing to spend anything on a better solution. So, my thinking is that if I could use my django server (on which I am still learning...) to host a webapp that would render a page from each of those files, we could use that as reference and only open the file when we need to make an update.   My general thoughts on the high level program would be as follows: 1. point the program at the root directory.  2. it would generate links for each folder, once clicked, it would display another set of links for subdirs or files. If files, it would display a page rendered with the content of the office file. If folder, display links to folder contents, rinse repeate.  I dont know how to do any of this, yet. I'll figure it out. What I am looking for is if it is even possible to render a page with Django using a MS Office file as a source. If I know I can do that, I'll figure out the rest.  If that is not possible, I wont be wasting my time trying to figure it out...  Thank you for any input!

	0.0	0.846	0.154	0.8442	just to be clear,do you want to inherit or create an instance of a class?; in the case of Person, you might want an instance me, you, him, her, but then you might want to have a different behavior and inherit from person into baby and include a method for pooping pants; (anyone can poop their pants, it's the best example I could come up with on the spot :\)
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4019	<@Gemma> take a look at this <http://eflorenzano.com/blog/2008/05/04/inheritance-vs-composition/> might help you in choosing what path to take
	0.0	0.164	0.836	0.6249	ok thanks guys
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Devorah> you could just use regex's to find F, L and replace B
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm not there yet <@Miguelina> how would I do that?
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.5023	without knowing all the details I can't give the exact code but would look something like this ; will need to try it out a bit and tweak it maybe
	0.0	0.267	0.733	0.6696	cool will do thanks!
	0.126	0.744	0.13	0.024	If you run into any trouble with regex I highly recommend using <http://regex101.com> which has a Python option for testing
	0.225	0.775	0.0	-0.9253	The string worked off the bat, but it's still saying there's a space in the 'correct' one that isn't being shown in mine..; I've spent way too much time on this one problem, it's such a pain when beginning and getting hung up on this tiny dumb part.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Miguelina> do you see why it's doing that? I can't figure out why it's doing that, it should be a fixed length field with 16 for first and 16 for last and 8 for birthdate
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Devorah> can you replace `workers = workers[:(XX+15)] + B.strip() + workers[(XX+24):]` with `workers = workers[:(XX+15)] + B + workers[(XX+24):]` and see

	0.134	0.805	0.061	-0.5216	Hey has anyone seen a nice tutorial or guide on how to make haystack facets work? Its more of the rendering side i'm struggling with, facet data is being collected I just cant render to templates The documentation is not the best.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It’s just “ signs , they are escaped because the whole string here is wrapped with “”; Try print(json.dumps(data))
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you printing that out?; or is it just displaying in the shell
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	huh?
	0.086	0.821	0.093	0.0516	you never answered my question though; you’re just loading the dict back into a dict after dumping to json; so what does `print(json.dumps(data))` look like?
	0.096	0.562	0.343	0.6597	yeah its super weird hold on i'll upload pics; This one using `json.dumps(user_details)`
	0.18	0.625	0.195	0.0516	what is `user_details`? Looks like you're dumping a string to a string
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its a dictionary; So i guess it makes sense, I json-ified the dict then made it readable using `json.loads`
	0.043	0.957	0.0	-0.296	what are you trying to do?; because if you’re printint the data out to a template, you don’t need to do the json stuff; and if you’re logging to file, you don’t need that either; basically, I think you’re driving yourself into an area of confusion about something that has zero relevance

	0.0	0.563	0.437	0.7351	really depends- do you care that it takes 20m? :)
	0.0	0.573	0.427	0.9398	I’d go the multiprocessing route over threading, but yeah, like <@Joann> said - depends how much you care; could be a good excuse to try the technique though
	0.061	0.837	0.103	0.2732	heh; I mean if it’s something you have to wait for the result for then I’d say yes.  How many cores does your machine have?
	0.067	0.782	0.151	0.3565	if the work you're doing is cpu bound I'm not sure if traditional multi-threading will help that much, wouldn't it be stuck on one core anyway?

	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.2732	you need to drop in C or use multiprocessing

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Multithreading for IO bound, Multiprocess for CPU bound
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	IIRC; How many processes should I have running at once?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with 8 HTs, I'd probably try 10; you could time that and then vary the # of processes and see if there's much change
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.1531	it really depends on a lot of different things, heh.
	0.214	0.507	0.279	0.1298	yeah; very hard even to estimate
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	The difference is likely to be relatively small in total runtime anyway tho.

	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	pypy is a python compiled python interpreter, no C underneath
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what's happenin
	0.697	0.303	0.0	-0.3182	I'm confused
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://pypy.org/> != <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>
	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.4404	right, so i'm not having a stroke; that's good
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what a rush; <@Ciera> so <http://pypy.org|pypy.org> and download the interpreter?
	0.0	0.621	0.379	0.6696	!= <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pipi>; yeah with a bit of luck it should automagically work
	0.113	0.845	0.041	-0.5675	*IIRC*, you need python to use C to use python to create the python interpreter so not as easy as "download the interpreter", you'll need to build it.  Last I saw it was a long build time.; can someone tell me I'm wrong and that you can download it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think there’s a binary distribution for it.
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	Looks like they have SVM here <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where are you at?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm in belgium. It's not that late but it's getting dark
	0.068	0.831	0.101	0.3182	My brother-in-law lived there for 10+ years, he's from California so there was a bit of weather shock.  He loved it otherwise.; I think he lived in Leuven, spoke Dutch and English, had to learn French
	0.115	0.885	0.0	-0.296	he tells the story of over a 100 days of no sun and he had an upcoming bike trip
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.7184	just as he goes on his trip, the sun opens up for 5 or 6 days and he has this glorious ride and then it goes back to cloudy, he said the whole country kinda slumps
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you Belgian?
	0.0	0.873	0.127	0.1531	yeah. I was born in France but moved to belgium when I was 12
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.25	Alright about to try it out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	where are you at ? I suppose US west ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	northern California, east of San Francisco; it's been 4 to 16 degrees out here and I'm not use to this, I'm from southern california; I have thermals and ear muffs , often in the house
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is that °F or °C ?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	C
	0.074	0.587	0.338	0.8199	ah yeah that's pretty cool for California; it's around 0° here; you don't have good heating in the house ? More focused on cooling usually ?
	0.11	0.76	0.131	0.4033	brrr, I live on the way to the mountains so if I was a skiing fan this would be great, about 2 hours to some great slopes.  Too bad I can't deal with the cold.; Most of the houses in US are old double-pane windows that no longer hold the insulation, often about 2000square feet, so the heaters are kind of useless, the concern in most of the state is air conditioning
	0.0	0.65	0.35	0.5106	yeah well I guess in the south temperature are usually higher.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's highly variable too, in San Francisco, you might never use your heater but a couple of weeks a year because the proximity to the ocean keeps the temperature even
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.2382	at least in Belgium house have good insulation and heating; but then in the summer when there is a bit of sun nobody can handle it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is air conditioning a normal thing to have?
	0.423	0.577	0.0	-0.296	no, nobody has it
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	that's interesting, how many times a year would you say it's needed?
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.2263	you would only use it for a few weeks over the year. nt worth it
	0.1	0.615	0.285	0.7964	Seattle is like that and they've been having warm, dry summers.  My (ex) co-workers were miseable, weeks of hot, muggy, no relief, no way to cool at night; you working on any interesting projects?
	0.052	0.722	0.226	0.5612	yeah it's usually like that. But temp rarely reach 30; Average should be about 24-25 in the summer
	0.0	0.244	0.756	0.4753	that's nice!
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.7717	Yeah I was working on making our postgresql replicate, and before that on a SIP server with asyncio; pretty cool stuff to do; and you ?
	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.2023	lately, tinkering, I'm hobbyist not full-time programmer.  I've been playing with Dask <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>; Also, been trying to figure out how I can level up, my decorators, metaclasses, context managers, properties knowledge is non-existent; do you roll your own SIP?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4215	true
	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.1531	No but we have the need for a custom SIP server/proxy in some specific cases
	0.128	0.79	0.083	-0.3102	I used to manage the VOIP and the Lync servers, some of that stuff is black magic, some of it cool, most of it a pain

	0.211	0.677	0.113	-0.3182	Alright installed the binaries but there is no actual binary anywhere
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	start a new shell session?
	0.137	0.784	0.078	-0.296	Yeah I got it. I guess I downloaded the source but for some reason there was no distinction between the two
	0.069	0.766	0.165	0.655	but not sure whether you’d be able to hook into the subprocess.  that might be best left as a standalone debug, where your inputs match those from the subprocess call
	0.0	0.785	0.215	0.6369	<@Myong> play around with it, I've even heard of things initially going slower on pypy before going MANY times faster; nice
	0.0	0.725	0.275	0.2263	Worth running on pypy with multiprocessing?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Mirian> if you set `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` in settings, then the worker will run synchronously and you’ll be able to debug in pycharm
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.6369	that's a good question (euphemism for I don't actually know), though pypy is an interpreter with a GIL, I would imagine you'd see improvements; do tell how it turns out if you do
	0.0	0.612	0.388	0.2263	okay about to start
	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4019	the problem is that the subprocess runs on an entirely different process than what the debugger is attached to
	0.14	0.86	0.0	-0.4767	there is a settings `attach to subprocess automatically while debugging` <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-debugger.html>; but maybe it's an external process; and I've misunderstood that
	0.3	0.7	0.0	-0.4585	I’ve never had any success with that; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3182	Moment of truth for pypy w/multiprocessing; It's slowly going up. 10% through and its gone from 1.5 it/s to 2.35 it/s and keeps climbing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hello, I've got a celery worker that runs task that involves calling `subprocess.check_call(cmd)`. The cmd is a Python script. Is it possible to debug it using Pycharm inside a Celery worker debugger?
	0.0	0.753	0.247	0.3818	cool; what are you using to display the number of iterations per second?
	0.0	0.644	0.356	0.8016	`tqdm`!; Awesome library for progress bar; And I just found the code to work alongside multiprocessing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That's what I'm saying
	0.0	0.849	0.151	0.1531	pypy often requires warming up; such is life with JIT
	0.474	0.526	0.0	-0.2023	that's a strange result
	0.1	0.9	0.0	-0.2732	could I possibly have too many workers?; I have 8 total cores and 10 workers; should i drop it down and see what happens
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong> how does the pool communicate with the main process?; do you submit something to the pools, or just tell it where to read from, or..?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I submit them with list comprehension; `futures = [executor.submit(self.find_match, radio) for radio in self.missing_list]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and what's the typical size of the submitted data?
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	It's a string usually no longer than ~20 characters
	0.055	0.945	0.0	-0.2411	huh; I'm not 95% sure it's a communication overhead; each piece of data needs to be serialized, transmitted to the process, and deserialized. And then the same when the process finishes and communicates the result back
	0.115	0.676	0.209	0.34	Its just weird cause the normal interpreter improved ~80% from the MP
	0.0	0.889	0.111	0.4329	maybe PyPy was already fast so less room for improvement?; what if you submitted a chunk of data each time? like a hundred entries or so
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Difference in speed is `2.55 it/s vs 3.9 it/s`
	0.371	0.629	0.0	-0.6486	ugh now `with open()` in pypy can't take the `newline=''` argument
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Meg> I've figured it out! This script was an setup.py's script and I've changed it to the actual path of the file
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	how is it going?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I haven't run it in a bit, but it was still running around 2.7 it/s
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It is not. It's just a small script that deals with data that's not very sensitive. I'm gonna profile it again on pycharm w/PyPy
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.25	alright
	0.0	0.883	0.117	0.2144	<@Suellen> huh, I just found something interesting; downloaded the 3.5 version binaries, but python 2.7 installed...

	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.2023	So Installed it from their nightly py3.5 branch here; <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/>; I downloaded the top most `pypy-c-jit-latest-win32.zip`

	0.274	0.726	0.0	-0.2235	I cant find the stable release binaries...
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.3612	what about earlier releases like <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/pypy-c-jit-93274-44b347a2f013-win32.zip>
	0.095	0.807	0.098	0.0258	There is only the source that you have to build yourself and it looks quite extensive; And 502 error on their site lol; Downloading now

	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.5473	LOL; So I somehow did download 2.7; Cause this one has `pypy3.exe` as opposed to the one I have now `pypy.exe`
	0.231	0.769	0.0	-0.34	I'm unfortunately unable to because I'm on a work computer.
	0.08	0.804	0.116	0.2023	iirc, there are many places that MS will accept *nix slashes now, I was floored when I saw that.  Shows my geekiness.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And maintain the structure as a list of tuples
	0.0	0.894	0.106	0.0772	Yea I want to subtract each pair and return a list of the results
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.5574	Okay so since tuples are immutable you wont be able to touch the values. You can grab them though and place them into a list
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I was looking into functools but couldn’t quite think of something without using for loops
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yea I mean returns new list not change the existing one
	0.0	0.745	0.255	0.34	So say you wanna subtract 2 from each value

	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.8221	Hey guys, I have a list of tuples such as [(1,2), (3,4)] I want to subtract the values in each tuple pair. So it would look like 1-2, 3-4 and so on. What’s the most efficient way to do this?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	did you tell it what version ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Another question guys. How do you pair up elements in an array that was right next to each other. For example: [1, 2, 3, 4] would be [(1,2),(3,4)]; I’m currently using itertools.combinations but that’s not what I’m looking for
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`[tuple([0:2]), tuple([2:])]` manually
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What package does izip come from?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	izip?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Tried to import it from itertools; Yea 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its itertools; `from itertools import izip`
	0.213	0.787	0.0	-0.4019	I’m getting the error that it’s not an attribute of itertools
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if using an IDE
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	That comes with python; I have zip_longest and that’s it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	izip doesnt exist
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	back, zip is a builtin
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	past 2.7
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Izip is also a built in?
	0.524	0.476	0.0	-0.296	no; zip is
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think I’m using 3.5
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`zip(x,y)`
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.2263	Okay so it’s basically the same as izip
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.4304	; I'm sure there are more elegant ways to do it but I'm a bit of a long-hand kind of guy; in your case a would be 1,3,5 [0::2] and b would be 2,4,6 or [1::2], then zip(a,b)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	izip requires that you pass the iterables that you will zip; plural
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yea but in this case I set the iterable to a variable and set the size of each pair to 2
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you said 3.5 right?
	0.0	0.748	0.252	0.6597	Actually wait I think you were right. I’d do something like zip(A[::2], A[1::2]); Yup that was it. Thanks man
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you did the work
	0.0	0.449	0.551	0.8225	You pretty much did lol. Cant take all the credit
	0.044	0.919	0.037	0.126	I think your approach is appropriate, abstract the stuff you can, mixin the stuff that needs tweaking.  I have a story that goes with this...; <@Casie> so my dad once worked as a buyer and the problem was that all the suppliers had their own way they supplied the data.  The product was a commodity so buying was mostly based on availability and price and not features; he implemented an ingest system and said to the suppliers, "this is our system, here are the tools to adhere, we'll even teach you, if you don't adhere, we will buy from the other companies that do."; there was a bunch of squabbling but my dad's company won because a) they were a big buyer and b) the tech the companies were offering was awful (word docs, xeroxed sheets, faxes(!))
	0.0	0.735	0.265	0.4522	Hey <@Cliff>, so do you want to subtract the same value from each?
	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	looks good, and....?
	0.0	0.991	0.009	0.0772	What's everyone's opinion on the following (complex) scenario:  I am building a platform which retrieves order data of multiple webshops, those orders have different suppliers (depending on the products).  Each of these suppliers have complete different API's. Expect data to be mapped differently and have different features. For example:  Supplier #1 has "Post Order" (POST to API), "Get Stock" (from FTP), "Get Order Status" (from FTP). Supplier #2 has "Post Order" (SOAP WSDL), "Get Stock" (SOAP WSDL). Supplier #3 has "Post Order" (Through E-mail)  We have a "BaseSupplier" class right now, and want every feature to be a mixin ("PostOrderMixin", "GetStockMixin", "GetOrderStatusMixin"). However, these Mixins still just have abstract functions because the actual implementation for a supplier is so different. But I'm not really able to move forward on this right now because it's starting to feel ugly..  How would you design this?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	didn't get it; what are you trying to find? Find 'y' inside the array indexed by 'x'?
	0.129	0.765	0.106	-0.2263	My problem says - # # Searches the 2d array 'records' for firstname, lastname. # Returns the index of the record or -1 if no record exists #; so I'm wondering if they want both values returned

	0.0	0.884	0.116	0.2732	right now they're having me create a bunch of functions first and then piece it all together afterwards.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see. I don't know how your data structures are laid out
	0.778	0.222	0.0	-0.5423	it's horrible

	0.119	0.881	0.0	-0.4019	damn. Can't you copy everything to a file and run it on your pc?; I usually do this; for online tests and stuff
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	yeah that's what I've resorted to
	0.244	0.756	0.0	-0.5859	it's hard to figure out with these systems what's a limitation of their teaching platform and whats the limitation of the program
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	this data structure of names; it sounds a lot like a dict
	0.0	0.526	0.474	0.4019	Yes, it's a 2d array

	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4767	but when I import it locally it's giving me the \n and when I .rsplit it's not stripping it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or i can analyze the request and pull from cache depending
	0.0	0.806	0.194	0.34	hmmmm; you can iterate easily over the lines of the files
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4215	if you want to get real fancy it sounds like a job for an ETL to handle
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with open("file") as f:    for line in f:       print(line)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	keep you API totally decoupled, just parses a route and makes a data request
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if you need the line numbers to do some specific operation you can do the following
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.3182	then your ETL system handles making sure you get the right data

	0.0	0.707	0.293	0.807	of course i'm relatively new and just hacking things together, there could certainly be better practices (and I'd be interested in hearing them!)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So this is what I have here : 
	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	OH i just reread your thing, let me give you a better answer
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	try what I said and print the lines; with open(P, 'r') as names:    for name in names:       print(name)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ajax request to the server from the browser?
	0.094	0.812	0.094	0.0	just to debug; the with block is useful as it guarantees that the file is closed after you use it; your code is leaving the file open
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the most real-time you can get
	0.034	0.926	0.04	0.1027	I would whip up a flask-restful API (way easier than it sounds if you havent) then handle requests there and pull the required data either directly from a DB or from an ETL. You're front end would be handling the "real time" updates, i'm familar with using Angular or Knockout.js to bind elements to data models. Then you would have some ajax request firing occasionally to poll for new data
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it shouldn't be harmful in this simple example but it can generate a lot of bugs; strings also have the split funcion; you can do name.split("|") to get an array of strings
	0.0	0.664	0.336	0.7964	that's a good thinking question tho, what the best way to do a live check for new data....
	0.0	0.819	0.181	0.4767	I had it that earlier but it was still giving me new lines in the string
	0.19	0.81	0.0	-0.6597	the problem was with read; read loads the file in a single string with the "\n"s; if you iterate over the lines that shouldn't be a problem
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; so that's the response I get now
	0.156	0.642	0.202	0.128	ok; weird file though; what are those blank lines?
	0.166	0.834	0.0	-0.2484	don't know it's is kind of weird; they weren't there before
	0.141	0.734	0.124	-0.0772	if its ok to ignore them, you can; if line.index("|") &gt;= 0:    #do stuff    line.split("|")
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ozie> ETL?
	0.0	0.817	0.183	0.5373	Not that I know off the top of my head but it's quite simple; Create a view in Flask that returns the data; <https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/>
	0.0	0.699	0.301	0.6326	So I have it like this now ; and it's only giving me the last set
	0.0	0.85	0.15	0.3182	So in your HTML template, make sure you import the jquery CDN script tag
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	A typical ajax post request looks something similar to this..
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also why is it spitting out that io.textiowrapper ?
	0.081	0.894	0.025	-0.4854	idk, but your print is outside the loop man; it is not indented; and you are printing names everytime, inside a loop over names; I dont think that makes sense; you can print it once outside the loop; if you want to see it; btw, the object dump you posted is probably the output of print(names)
	0.0	0.879	0.121	0.4404	in your case you might be better off using a get request; <https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/>; You may also have to pip install the flask-cors package
	0.166	0.715	0.119	-0.6042	ok so now I have 4 lists it looks like, but it still has the \n; but if I put in rsplit() in it I can strip it but then it shows up as ; other wise it's ; sorry if I seem dense but this course has been killing me. I'm just not seeing iteration clearly yet.
	0.0	0.896	0.104	0.4515	<@Corrinne> thank you, I’ll reach out again if any questions. what would be <http://your-server/my-data> in this case? I’m assuming what I’ll need (as said earlier) is a file (.py) that queries the database. Would it be that?
	0.0	0.979	0.021	0.0772	You would query the DB from the view in the flask app; for example your `app.route("/my-data")` would be where you would query the server using the ajax script as above; When the AJAX script runs in the browser, it makes a request to the view in Flask. The view is run and returns whatever you want it to back to the browser

To be specific, I've got a Pyramid app and a Celery worker - those are two services managed by docker-compose. I'd love to have a possibility to run two debuggers - one for an Pyramid API and the second for Celery worker at the same time

	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.858	0.142	0.8074	you should not depend on a variable initialized 'outside'.  `main` is you program entrypoint and could be a good point to initialize the client. A good approach is that your utils function take as input an instance of the client. Something like ; (if you're not using python 3 the type annotation will result in a invalid syntax error)

	0.039	0.852	0.109	0.6196	they are implementation details a user isn't supposed to touch; at least, I know I've never touched shims at all; and PyCharm discovers pyenv virtualenvs on its own, which is nice; well, Tox expects to find all python versions on PATH, so some changes are necessary; for example you do: `pyenv local 3.4.3 3.5.2 3.6.4 3.7.0`; and Tox will work OK after that; not ideal of course
	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.3142	well for example it's not working out of the box with tox <https://www.holger-peters.de/using-pyenv-and-tox.html>; it's not really a big trouble and I use it daily but for a beginner it might be too abstract

	0.021	0.927	0.052	0.4436	Hey guys I have a list of strings from a separate string that I split, but in some cases if the string contains typos where they dont include spaces my script will not catch it.

	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.4215	do you need those square brackets?; if not, you can always remove them/add space and it would make splitting easier I guess

	0.036	0.933	0.03	-0.1532	<@Suellen> `re.findall('\[[a-z\-a-z]+[a-z]\]', l[0])` for this string `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`; It gives me `[usa-az]` but nothing else; I've just never really used regex; so not sure; This one matches everything except the string on the end it gives nothing  `re.findall('(\[.*?\])|(\].*?)', l[0])`; Just need to figure out what to put instead of `|` to match the other string on the end; The thing about it is this is a type; so typo; so if its in the correct format I dont need to touch it; I need to separate them; yeah; `\[.*?\]|\]` this works; in `re.findall`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and is this the entire string? `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`
	0.0	0.694	0.306	0.296	Yeah that will be the input
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with the quote marks?
	0.2	0.8	0.0	-0.3612	no quotes sorry; `\[.*?\]` finds the two strings with brackets; so it returns `['[usa-az]', '[h]']`; oops
	0.0	0.843	0.157	0.0772	And what do you want it to return?
	0.0	0.958	0.042	0.0772	But I cant figure out how to find the string on the end so basically `]paypal` bit dont include the closing bracket; I want the two previous strings plus `paypal`; `['[usa-az]', '[h]', 'paypal']`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`(?P&lt;group_1&gt;\[\w{3}\-\w{2}\])\[\w\](?P&lt;group_2&gt;\w+$)`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	doesn't find the `[h]`
	0.171	0.679	0.149	0.1724	I thought you said you didnt want the h?; oh ok sorry i just saw
	0.206	0.758	0.036	-0.7203	No worries; The only thing though, not sure if it will always be 3 character a dash then two characters, what can I use to match any number of character? Just `\w`; ?; Or +
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What are the possible combinations?; This should work; `r"(?P&lt;group_1&gt;\[\w{1,3}\-\w{1,3}\])(?P&lt;group_2&gt;\[\w\])(?P&lt;group_3&gt;\w+$)"`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Got it!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; Worked for me
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	Yep same here
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4767	woo
	0.044	0.898	0.058	0.2023	There are so many ways people could make mistakes in the title this is gonna be fun; So basically the title format is `[location]` then `[h]` then whatever else followed by `[w]` and other stuf; But in some cases people do or dont include spaces; And it can be mixed and matches; matched
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where is the data coming from?
	0.0	0.836	0.164	0.5157	Reddit; It's submission titles; Just building a notifier for /r/hardwareswap; It works but cant deal with badly formatted titles
	0.0	0.579	0.421	0.624	hmm, probably better to make the regex more flexible
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are all of the submissions inside square brackets?
	0.0	0.597	0.403	0.4019	Yes they have to be
	0.0	0.172	0.828	0.5859	ok that helps
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see
	0.0	0.848	0.152	0.3612	It only becomes an issue if the item is in the format like `[h]1070 gtx[w]...`
	0.136	0.864	0.0	-0.296	But there's no kind of validation; Still think there's a way with regex to filter it
	0.016	0.887	0.097	0.5329	Yeah; I can always just grab the item the person wants; and see if the starting point of the string is between the start of the want and have tag; that might be easier; Lol; Instead of splitting it up; But then I have to check if the string occurs both before and after, but in that case it doesn't matter I can just grab the first occurence
	0.219	0.781	0.0	-0.2411	I'm not sure how the input is received
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32430620/python-string-search-starting-from-a-specific-position-within-a-string>; It's received as a simple string; I split it
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.296	On the r/hardware site now; Ok so people just put it in the title; `[USA-FL] [H] Paypal [W] Dell u2718q, Cablemods (black and white) for EVGA PSU`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup
	0.0	0.662	0.338	0.6249	Ok the good thing is they all look formatted in a similar way
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	Yeah the only thing is the spaces
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	does the [h] mean payment method right?
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.0772	It differentiates between have and want
	0.062	0.875	0.063	0.0111	Thank you; Getting a `Runtime Error: dictionary changed size during iteration`; Basically iterating through the dictionary and popping off keys that dont pass a certain `if` statement; I tried to create a temp dict but didnt work; I made a list comprehension that does the same thing; lets see if it works; Got it to work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Rather than pop as you iterate
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.296	Was thjis; now `return {k: v for k, v in match_dict.items() if have_index &lt; v &lt; want_index}`; No issues so far lets see if this beast works
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	tasty
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	One thing I still haven't figured out about list comprehensions and such is when to use if at the end or before the `for` portion.
	0.102	0.792	0.106	0.0258	Think you always use it after for as its a conditional statement; But i could be wrong; I know you can get pretty complex with some of these comprehensions
	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.4588	They're satisfying when you get them right; I remember my professor gave extra points when I first really got into python for doing list comps so that's all I ever did
	0.0	0.688	0.312	0.6124	Yeah totally; They can really condense a lot of code into a nice one liner
	0.0	0.938	0.062	0.4404	I did something with that sub. Also used regex to get what i needed. Check out the Post, you may find a piece or two useful. <https://rorixrebel.github.io/reddit-hwswap-flask-app.html>; Mine works more as a, find what i need rather than notification; But it also filters by location and type of transaction

	0.295	0.705	0.0	-0.6908	Because it's not JSON; And it doesn't look like JSON: ; rather, it looks like JSON without curly brackets :)
	0.719	0.281	0.0	-0.3736	no? why?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Suellen> the string format wont work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I would do a split on the `,` and then split on the `:` to load the key/value in a dict

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can you specify JSON as the response from the API?
	0.059	0.898	0.043	-0.171	<@Corrinne> No I can't, I have no options for that.; <@Corrinne> There is probably a bug in the API because the docs says it should return a JSON object.; I am not getting a valid json object from this url, <http://omniexplorer.info/ask.aspx?api=gettx&amp;txid=5fa342f704ca6a9ae84134de8f2d987c18980de70a744d1aa8472e847555fcbd> how can I convert it to Json?

	0.017	0.97	0.013	-0.1179	OpenCV question: I have a large set of images which are cellphone photos taken of the same document type (driver’s license).  They come in all shapes and sizes, meaning, different angles of the camera, different distances from the camera to the driver’s license, different lighting, etc.; is there any way in OpenCV to identify in each image a known landmark, then crop, resize, rotate, etc each image so that for the final result, I have a set of images that are completely uniform (e.g. driver’s license fills the whole image, they all look the same, etc)?; and if it’s possible, would it be monumentally hard to do?
	0.051	0.766	0.183	0.7351	<@Dexter> its potentially doable with something like training a haar classifier, difficulty depends on your familiarity with opencv and training sets; (caveat: my knowledge around this stuff is pretty old and there's likely better things in the modern machine learning world?)

	0.0	0.956	0.044	0.168	What the difference between the black Python shell and the white IDLE one ?; How do I know where I want to run my scripts ?; I keep on getting the "SyntaxError: invalid syntax when I try to run python get-pip.py
	0.074	0.926	0.0	-0.4019	idle is a very simple integradted development environment; python shell is where you write directly to the interpreter; so if you’re getting a syntax error from code you’ve written in idle, then its not going to run
	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.631	I get that but I am wondering what I am doing wrong. I am geting the syntax directly from Azure

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Post the code you've written in IDLE
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or pip install virtualenv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you need to post what you wrote in `get-pip.py`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is this the 1st time you've written any code? Not asking that in a mean way
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	ok, that’s why
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.296	ok, so you know the difference between terminal and db shell; what you need to do with the above is write in the terminal, not the shell
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Of course. Have you tried any totorials / courses online?
	0.064	0.861	0.075	0.1027	Yes, the basis stuff from teach your kids how to program with python and automate the boring stuff... Idle worked for what I needed it to. I also used anaconda notebook to query a sql database
	0.0	0.816	0.184	0.4466	OK so you should get yourself familiar with executing python files from the terminal
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.296	no, that’s the python shell
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You don'r run a pip command from within the python terminal
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that’s activated when you entered in `python` in the terminal
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	exit python; and try pip install virtualenv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in my cmd window ?
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	type `exit()` into the python console; Then from the terminal of your machine. run `pip install virtualenv`
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.5367	that worked. So how do I save my multi-line scripts then ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	You need to write them in a text editor
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	use a text editor or ide; sublime text, atom, etc
	0.0	0.652	0.348	0.4939	save them with .py at the end
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And then I would execute them through cmd line ?
	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.4019	yes exactly; so once you've written some code in a .py file; navigate to the same directory as that file from your terminal; and run `python myfile.py`; or whatever you call it
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.4753	oh nice another dba. i came into python via the database world too!

	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.296	no
	0.234	0.426	0.34	0.25	No you can save them anywhere
	0.178	0.822	0.0	-0.3353	So another ignorant question... if I see "./path/file.py" what does the "./" mean ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	where are you seeing this?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm not seeing it right now but I see it a lot in the dev community
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`./` means execute the file at the given path starting current directory; if you omit the `.`, it means start from the root directory
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If other changes were made, you don't have them yet, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I should have gotten them when I sync'd it

	0.064	0.841	0.096	0.2732	I would concentrate on getting the syntax down and comfortable with the language; then you can dig into using pandas, numpy, etc; you can do all this locally, no need for azure

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> were you talking to me?
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.296	no it was for alex
	0.201	0.669	0.13	-0.5283	Ah okay; Okay I got it to work now; Holy cow `parse.parse_qs()` does not like to work; Giving `parse_qs` a url with a single argument and instead of the dict key of the argument being the argument itself, it's the whole url
	0.252	0.748	0.0	-0.4019	The arguments should be taken in by useing `sys.argv[n]`
	0.0	0.161	0.839	0.8553	yeah; thank you! I appreciate the help
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Show a screengrab or type an example of what you normally put in here; For argv[2] you may have to separate the x and y coordinates; or try to input them as a tuple as such `(x, y)`
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	Yeah you probably have to separate them
	0.24	0.541	0.22	-0.0772	its kind of unwieldy but i have like 9 arguments to pass
	0.157	0.64	0.203	-0.0516	Yeah you may want a more interactive script; instead of 9 arguments of the command line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`start_pos = start_x, start_y = input("Coordinates of first cell: ")`; what is the goal of this line ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when you use `input("Coordinates of first cell: ")` you get a string back; you can't unpack a string in two variables
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	unless you're using python 2, right? then it's eval'd; (don't use python 2, and don't use `input` in python 2 especially)
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ahhh i knew I forgot the split
	0.0	0.803	0.197	0.4019	yes, you'll have to convert everything; `"2, 2".split()` results in `["2", "2"]`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`coords = [int(x) for x in coord_input.split()]`; that gives a list of ints
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ahhh ok
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and you can set x, y = coords
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong> Python says you can't have a generator running in 2 or more threads
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I actually got the previous thing to work properly
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	would this also work? `int(input("Counter Width and Height: ").split(','))`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you'd basically be doing `int(["2", "2"])`
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.296	no, that won't work because you can't turn a list into an int
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.34	you need to pull each value out
	0.71	0.29	0.0	-0.5994	No problem what's up
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i need to try to keep the variable names the same so they work with the code at the bottom
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.5267	Okay; just take input in a different variable like `coord_input = input("Enter coordinates (x, y)")`; Then do the following; `start_pos = start_x, start_y = [int(x) for x in coord_input.split(",")]`
	0.0	0.594	0.406	0.6249	awesome, I think I see whats going on there
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	So if someone inputs "2,2,2" you will get a list of [2,2,2]
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we need the for loop to extract the ints
	0.0	0.886	0.114	0.4404	Yeah it's just a clean way to do a for loop; So it iterates over the items returned by `coord_input.split(",")` which basically splits the strings at the comma; and removes whitespace; It returns a list object; but the items are strings, we want integers
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i was wondering how it returned a list, because we enclosed it in a list?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	.split just splits the string up, and each actual charcter in the string is placed into the list; so if I did `"my name is kbman".split(" ")` I'd get `["my", "name", "is", "kbman"]` back
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok
	0.147	0.674	0.18	0.1124	But it doesn't modify the original string; it simply returns a value
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	now I could use the same coord_input variable for counter size right?  I can maybe format the message to reference counter size?
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.5499	You can reassign the variable but when it takes the input the `coord_input` variable is a string of values entered by the user
	0.087	0.836	0.077	-0.0772	right; what would I do for just one value? assuming that whatever the user sends back is going to be a string; agh; I got an error from the split method; 
	0.0	0.724	0.276	0.891	you can make it into whatever data type you'd like (assuming you have all values required like a key and value for dictionary); Looks like you input it incorrectly; you dont need the prentheses; just put it in a `""`
	0.428	0.572	0.0	-0.4574	Oh!; got the same error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is it "107 now
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	'"107'
	0.0	0.735	0.265	0.3818	Yeah; Hmmmm; Wait is this on the commandline; or a separate input I apologize
	0.0	0.488	0.512	0.2732	seperate; well wait
	0.0	0.612	0.388	0.4215	Okay okay gotcha,; Just put the two numbers
	0.0	0.561	0.439	0.5719	i mean like yeah its using the command line
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	separated by comma
	0.344	0.312	0.344	0.0	ok no string i see
	0.0	0.714	0.286	0.1531	YEah but not as argv
	0.0	0.375	0.625	0.6124	right; ok making progress i think
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.2263	Okay
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	link your code again
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	1 sec; oh wait, i think i know what it is
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's the same thing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`input(" how many whatever")`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you gotta make any inputs that need to be an integer actual integers
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	right
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can do `int(input("number here"))`
	0.0	0.261	0.739	0.8176	hooray; thank you dude i appreciate it
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.5994	No problem
	0.086	0.747	0.167	0.2261	so would I need the results folder built first here? I figured it just could have created it automatically; ; yeah that was it; its working, though it didn't cut the counters right, but thats probably just becasue I had the wrong numbers, thank you!
	0.084	0.916	0.0	-0.2755	Hey <@Fabian> that issue may have been due to the directory results not existing; Something like this for setup would build it for you 
	0.0	0.264	0.736	0.4199	thank you!
	0.075	0.85	0.075	-0.25	These are just conventions, you don’t have to use `_variables` at all if you don’t want to.  They can be useful to communicate your intentions to someone using your code, but a lot of people don’t bother with them.

	0.088	0.713	0.199	0.6712	yeah given that it’s convention you’ll find even individual people use it inconsistently; I honestly just don’t bother most of the time anymore, although I’ve always found the idea of protected data kind of silly

	0.0	0.7	0.3	0.4588	probably; if you asked a question that is :)
	0.017	0.983	0.0	-0.2263	My question is concerning some kind of bug that I could not understand and maybe because of my few experience with processes in Python. I am scraping data from one website called <http://castorama.fr|castorama.fr> and in my script I am printing just to show for me the products that I inserted to my database. I am using a map function and processes with Pool.; Sometimes it blocks and it does not print anymore products despite the fact that there are more. I should Ctrl-C to stop.; p = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)     magasins = magasin_ids()     p.map(get_all_data,magasins)     p.close()     p.join(); This is my main function. My question is there any possibility to be the processes that I am using not to be synchronized at some point ?

	0.081	0.76	0.159	0.5622	It looks OK; Not that 1000 lines of stack trace :); well, does it block on close or join?; i.e., if you do a `print('just before join')` and same after join, you could see that it blocks on join or on close; that's expected since it's waiting for all tasks to finish
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Is that mean that a process didn't finish?
	0.198	0.714	0.087	-0.4215	not yet; it depends on how long it blocks on close &amp; join; if it's too much maybe something is wrong
	0.159	0.755	0.085	-0.3071	I am using 4 processes to a list with 102 elements; The saddest thing is that for 90 elements it collects the information perfectly but after that it blocks.
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4404	hm.. maybe the task hangs and it's a good idea to track execution of the tasks themselves
	0.145	0.767	0.088	-0.2617	I added print before join and after but it is blocked right now and doesn't print anything
	0.095	0.788	0.116	0.1234	so it blocks on close?; I'm 90% sure a task just hangs for whatever reason; how complex is the worker func?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it depends on 3-4 functions which are relatively simple for execution; there is also a connection to database; maybe it could bug on connecting to database so all the other workers wait for him; it would be an idea to put print ("connect successful!!") after the connection to mysql

Automate tasks, build webpages, play with all the python standard library modules.; 2-&gt; <#C07EFMZ1N|help>, <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> , <#C1PB8ME48|sqlalchemy> , and a bunch of other channels will introduce you to new python just by reading others questions.

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	NoDeletionOccurredError or IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError?
	0.278	0.722	0.0	-0.6597	Pardon.; Copy and paste error; _Fixed_; I wrote two exceptions and both are resulting in this error.

	0.0	0.795	0.205	0.6597	just for good practices, I’d move the custom exception to its own module; and then import it directly; like `from databases.exceptions import NoDeletionOccurredError`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	If you import `NoDeleteOccurredError` and that is the name of a file `NoDeletionOccurredError.py` then you need to use the dot operator to import the exception object/class

	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.075	0.82	0.105	0.1154	boo I got Mongo to work. Will look at the docs for Postgres. Any tips on a simple api I can use?; Normally I would google something like this, but wanted to ask people on here to get some feedback. Do not feel like getting hacked.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	a simple API for what tho?
	0.0	0.925	0.075	0.4754	currently we have a mongo db instance with user data that needs to call a different db to get a score for a candidate.; So ideally the algorithm db would get information and send back a score for the client side db to show

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Fabian> I saw this post but is there a way to do it without use  or  instructions ?
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.296	I think the way you used it should work? let me open up a console; yep
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Fabian> it doesn't work (the way I used). This works on c++.
	0.0	0.765	0.235	0.7902	i just got it to work on the console; ; make sure you're using the right indentation; If anyone is able to help me out with this, I would totally appreciate it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Fabian> the output should be this (c++ on left): <https://i.imgur.com/BXmUZIo.png>; ops. right
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ahh then you need to do something different in python
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	there you go
	0.105	0.895	0.0	-0.2508	<@Fabian> I found a way to do it with the same way of c++:  `output: 1456789`; a little ugly but works.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	is there such a thing as an API schema query, I know API are (loosely) convention based.  Is there some common query to return the schema?
	0.0	0.762	0.238	0.3612	that's what swagger and the like are for, right?
	0.0	0.929	0.071	0.2263	okay, I'll go check it out; <@Frieda> I'm thinking on the opposite side, as the consumer, is there a way to ask Swagger, can I see your schema?
	0.305	0.695	0.0	-0.7837	i could be completely wrong re: swagger; <@Seema> i really doubt there's a standard for that. a lot of people try to hide their API
	0.067	0.933	0.0	-0.0772	or in my case, hey government body with public API, your documentation is meh, just show me your structure
	0.0	0.76	0.24	0.6249	it'd be awesome if you could do `/api/schema.json` and get a map of the api
	0.0	0.251	0.749	0.4574	yes! exactly
	0.0	0.552	0.448	0.7579	yeah, i don't think that exists; but i'd happily sign a petition

	0.07	0.902	0.028	-0.4515	which variables and in what manner do you want to use them?; I'm a bit confused about the ingestion, the instr.txt gets opened and read once, correct?  If so, your `while line:` is indented -&gt; performed under the open().  Is that intended for some reason...???
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I dont think so, it's the variables at the bottom
	0.0	0.893	0.107	0.7537	use a list accumulator, close out the while loop and then you can iterate through the accumulator.  Or you'd really rather skip the iterator, you can straight assign the values manually; then you could go with lines[0], lines[1], it's not the most pythonic way but it'll get you there; go ahead and ask the room, I may be returning a gift that I forgot to return earlier today (doh!)
	0.0	0.954	0.046	0.2263	During the while loop, you're re-assigning the same variable several times without doing anything to them; Might be worth reading the document in. iterating over the lines using a for loop as <@Seema> suggested and making lists of items you need
	0.167	0.745	0.089	-0.296	thank you guys, ill try screwing with it once I get pycharm to start up; oh i included that in the post; its at the bottom
	0.0	0.645	0.355	0.296	Ok i see the file sample
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	here's a post that goes a little more in depth as to my intent with an example source file <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/183187/crop-multiple-images-from-single-image/183222#183222>
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.4019	Have you tried it by just setting some default values here..
	0.0	0.333	0.667	0.4588	yeah at the top
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah that was the old code; at the bottom is the newer code, before I was taking user input, its quicker to read a file
	0.0	0.766	0.234	0.5994	ok, besides taking any user input or reading in from a file, have you tried it with fixed values?
	0.0	0.733	0.267	0.4588	yeah once i tried setting all of them to none first at the top
	0.0	0.732	0.268	0.296	Ok and I'm guessing that didnt work
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nope; would i still use the while loop after?; still getting the same issue it seems when i try this; ; ah whoops
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	so `while lines:` will run forever
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It means you're trying to split something that can't be split
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	which effectively means you're splitting something that isn't a string
	0.0	0.728	0.272	0.4574	ah that means i dont need the split anymore!; interesting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	this is where pdb and logging come in handy
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pdb?; agh
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think, looking at the data you're reading in, they were splitting a line with 2 numbers on it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the python debugger; hold for link; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	seems the file is closing before it could finish

	0.434	0.566	0.0	-0.5574	i believe it is right now; ; just a confusing error
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh so i should still be calling split then
	0.389	0.611	0.0	-0.6249	¯\_(ツ)_/¯; just saying there's no exception raised by _that_ block
	0.0	0.554	0.446	0.8338	fucking a it worked!; Thank you so much <@Frieda> you saved me, i really appreciate it
	0.0	0.811	0.189	0.4201	That's a shame.. For Treehouse. Although I really like some of their other teachers too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I could maybe use python subprocess to `curl`?
	0.11	0.89	0.0	-0.2732	<@Glinda> i mean...you could...but i'd probably spend my time figuring out why the other two are blocked. especially `requests`
	0.09	0.729	0.181	0.4133	did all the logic look otherwise ok in my code? specifically the loop at the bottom? getting some funny results, math isnt my strong suit
	0.112	0.569	0.319	0.8399	yeah, so far, so good; <@Fabian> honestly not sure what you were trying to accomplish so i just cut that part. explain, in english, what you're looking to do?
	0.0	0.845	0.155	0.296	ah ok give me one sec, its a little complex, or at least I think
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	that makes sense
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	gotta get out of that code mindset
	0.0	0.813	0.187	0.6798	<@Frieda> I know this is an open ended question, but what was the most effective way for you to learn Python / Development?
	0.0	0.919	0.081	0.212	uh. i built things; i mean, where do you want me to start? when i first learned any sort of "coding"?; or learning python specifically?
	0.0	0.583	0.417	0.6124	Ok that was the answer I was hoping for / expecting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or how i learn stuff now?
	0.0	0.437	0.563	0.631	Yeah its been a while but yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Corrinne> was that a bit earlier than you wanted?; <@Fabian> parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
	0.032	0.968	0.0	-0.296	<@Fabian> so that line multiplies `h` by `row` (I'll call that `x`), then `major_rows_h` by `row_m` (`z`). then it adds `x` to `start_y` and the sum of that to `z` . finally it assigns the sum of that to `y`; <@Corrinne> there's no max age on programming; one of the reasons i went to ORM was because i got interviewed by a recent hire who looked to be in their 50s
	0.0	0.903	0.097	0.4404	The thing I realised shortly after starting to learn python / Web dev, is that you need to grasp a whole load of other technologies to put it to good use
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	web dev is one of the hardest disciplines because you have to understand so many moving parts
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I think I see
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	frameworks, servers, git, docker, aws, app engine etc..
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	Yeah exactly
	0.0	0.546	0.454	0.6114	ah ok i get it now; thank you again!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Fabian> break it out into multiple steps if you need to
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It's all time and experience though
	0.0	0.7	0.3	0.4588	code is cheap; obvious code &gt; clever code
	0.0	0.842	0.158	0.4588	if you were a clever as possible when you wrote the code, how will you ever debug it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yeh I learnt that quickly when I started out
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	with python, at least, whatever you're wanting to do has probably already been done and put into stdlib; _always_ check the docs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup, Python goes so deep!
	0.254	0.746	0.0	-0.5815	i've been looking into learning Go lately and it's hard using a language that doesn't love you
	0.099	0.789	0.113	0.0956	For me, the biggest benefit has been just learning general programming principles; Ooh yeh I've watched a few vids on GO. Doesn't look friendly
	0.102	0.476	0.422	0.8946	it's an interesting language, and definitely fast. but not friendly; i need to learn more Rust. that's a great community; and fun language

	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4019	`major_columns, major_rows` etc; so right now, for example, all the arguments to range at the bottom, are undefined apparently
	0.0	0.881	0.119	0.4019	okay.... I'm starting to wrap my head around what you're doing, you're attempting to manually, line by line, assign the values
	0.0	0.831	0.169	0.4696	could you show me an example of what you mean?  how would i assign the values manually?
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

	0.13	0.87	0.0	-0.4019	Maybe someone know how to fix ` [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed` error, I'm using python with older debian distribution
	0.355	0.645	0.0	-0.5106	ssl is a pain in python; what version ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	betting on 2.7; my bet is 2.7.9
	0.177	0.823	0.0	-0.4215	there are a lot of 2.7 sadly. But it might just be a self signed certificates
	0.158	0.842	0.0	-0.4588	I remember troubles with normal certs on 2.7, it was related to an old version of system openssl
	0.093	0.83	0.076	-0.128	yeah and newer version of TLS are not available I believe; got trouble with the postgresql apt repo with ansible not too long ago due to python2.7
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Why did you change `ovv` to `Ovv`?
	0.0	0.712	0.288	0.594	can you share the url ?; are you sure the certs is a valid one ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	also when I try to pip upgrade I get `certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate`; <@Ciera> url I'm using is in local network
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and if you `wget` it?
	0.0	0.577	0.423	0.296	yep, it's same story
	0.0	0.27	0.73	0.4019	thats.. interesting
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`ERROR: The certificate of xxx is not trusted.`; `The certificate has expired `
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	probably something with the openssl installed and the certificates
	0.0	0.626	0.374	0.3382	well there you have it!
	0.0	0.408	0.592	0.4404	good old expiration
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	but why then pip also shows ssl erros?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	proxy ?
	0.495	0.505	0.0	-0.2411	hmm...; not sure
	0.052	0.746	0.201	0.6124	Try `pip -vvv [command]`; it's probably gonna spill a lot more details; if your network does something like mitm it's gonna be funny :|
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.359	0.641	0.0	-0.4215	sadly not enough; `wget -d <https://pypi.python.org/simple/pip>`?

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hi
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Could someone to explain me, why we need to use `generators`, and for which reasons?
	0.114	0.807	0.079	-0.2202	<@Ciera> thanks, for the video! but could you explain in two words, why need to use generatos? sometimes, I’m a little bit confused.
	0.0	0.54	0.46	0.855	<@Ciera> Yes! thanks for the explanation! and main goal of generatos it’s save time?
	0.0	0.888	0.112	0.6486	mainly memory (I didn't really illustrate that here but imagine if the list is 1 million item long); it can save time but if you need to complete the loop if will take the same time
	0.0	0.646	0.354	0.2942	<@Ciera> Okay, got it! thanks;)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the cleanest way would be to use the `multiprocessing` module, but then you don't launch a file; otherwise `subprocess.Popen()` with `python path/to/script.py`
	0.0	0.706	0.294	0.3612	hm, I like <@Ciera>'s approach. I personally use `subprocess.run()`.
	0.0	0.89	0.11	0.743	What's the best way to run a separate python file as a subprocess?; When I use Popen its opening a python repl in my terminal that I launch the main script from...; Well oddly enough when I run it on windows it runs as expected, however on linux it's opening the python repl in the terminal; subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, basepath+"/DeviceSocket.py"], shell=True)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what does your python script do? does it require input?
	0.018	0.878	0.104	0.8126	Currently have a Django list table view for books (w/ filters - book title, author, etc.). Books has a `foreign key` to comments, but comments has a `generic foreign key` to books (or anything else you could leave a comment on, like movies).   *How could I go about having a free form text based search on a field pointed to a generic foreign key?* For instance, a text filter for searching (filtering) through the comment list view column.
	0.11	0.872	0.018	-0.8834	Just needs to run the 'DeviceSocket' script as a subprocess, and continue on with the code block below the subprocess call in the main script; However when I run my main script in the terminal when it gets to the Popen line for that subprocess it opens a python repl in the terminal as if i had typed in "python3"; This problem only occurs when I got from windows to linux; in windows it continues on with the code block below the subprocess.Popen; Yeah unfortunately I'm restricted to using subprocess, the rest of the application is too tightly coupled to implement multithreading; Could it be that I don't have the file marked as an executable on my linux setup?
	0.18	0.82	0.0	-0.296	no, you don't execute it anyway; you point Python to it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as a subpocess
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what is the call you are using, <@Elsie>? Can you show us some code?
	0.06	0.94	0.0	-0.2411	<@Ciera> I am utilizing MySQL, however, I am not sure how to have this Book list view be filtered by the comments - given that there is the generic foreign key from comments to Books.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Where basepath is the path in which my main script and "DeviceSocket.py" are located; <@Ciera> using Popen?
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	yeah, my guess is it's not finding your script
	0.184	0.816	0.0	-0.4019	it should throw an error and not enter the repl in that case
	0.0	0.345	0.655	0.2263	hm okay
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	well at least on my system it does.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And just to reiterate, it does not enter the repl on win7; python 3.4.3

	0.134	0.746	0.119	-0.0772	That throws the same error. Also, pylint states that you may not use len as a conditional value.
	0.127	0.809	0.065	-0.5106	; I believe it's checking the numerical value of the letter and not the length of the string.; <@Elsie> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13398261/python-subprocess-call-and-subprocess-popen-stdout>. You might need to kill the process to make it finish if it hangs
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ciera> So the only way to go about this is using len(string)?

	0.403	0.597	0.0	-0.4019	 This throws the same error.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	instead of `shell=True`, you can do `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and then poll to see if it is completed unless you need some output from subprocess.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ashlea> What is `target`?
	0.217	0.783	0.0	-0.3612	Target is an argument that the function expects. It's a string.
	0.0	0.653	0.347	0.3939	you sure ? can you print it ?
	0.0	0.757	0.243	0.7717	Yes I can. And yes I am sure cause I'm running a unit test for this function, and I pass a string.; This is the only thing I have, I'm using VS Code: 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`cra.getFirstByContentContains(searchcontent, True)` is returning `None`; From the name I suppose because it couldn't find anything
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`for child in node` could return `None` if `found` is always `False`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what was commented out ?
	0.02	0.961	0.019	-0.012	That loop.; ; This is the issue.; When debugging, I go from line to line, and when I execute that string compare `if len(node.text) &gt;= len(target):`, it leaves the function, leaves the function that the unit test is calling etc.; Well, the debugger in VS Code is kind of confusing, but for as far as I can tell that is not the case.; I'm actually looking for a noncommercial alternative to VS Code for Python, cause the IDE has issues with its Python extension.
	0.089	0.822	0.089	0.0	Something seems off because the snippet you posted definitely does not appear to contain any iteration and comparisons/len called on None types would have thrown different error
	0.104	0.81	0.086	-0.0987	I thought the same.; Chances are the debugger is not clear enough, rather than that piece of code being incorrect?
	0.069	0.741	0.191	0.5106	Ok the problem is the function `getFirstRec` is not returning anything but you are splitting the return values which has an implicit iteration
	0.331	0.669	0.0	-0.3566	So we're missing a return statement then.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what if you comment it out and just have `return False, ''`
	0.09	0.845	0.065	-0.4215	Oh it must be me being rusty. Have been away from coding for some time. Started recently again. What <@Ciera> pointed out, I fixed that, but I must've been running the test while you and I were talking without saving the changes. It no longer throws that error now.; Comparing my code now with the snippet I posted, the only change is that else block that was missing.; So the function indeed must've been returning nothing, since none of the if statements equated to True.; I'm new to Python, combine that with some rustiness and this happens. <@Ciera> <@Antionette> Thanks a lot for the help guys.

	0.101	0.855	0.044	-0.5514	Can you post the stack trace?; Can you post the full function?; and throws the error? Couldn't that be beacuse that evaluates to false and then it continues to the `elif (node.items() is not None) and (len(node.items())) and isdeepsearch:` line where the error occurs?; So none of your if/elif statements are evaluating to true for some reason

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	neato
	0.328	0.672	0.0	-0.5971	but you don't want `records=[]`; don't use mutable types as default arguments

	0.0	0.796	0.204	0.5574	there's actually a lot of python underneath that <https://wiki.python.org/moin/TupleSyntax>; like some things are optional, that commas create tuples, and tuple assignment
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4215	nice
	0.139	0.693	0.169	0.0905	looks more or less OK, but it's hard to say

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Can someone verify that my raw post request is equivalent to the python post?; 
	0.0	0.93	0.07	0.3612	you probably don't need to set Content-Length by yourself; hm.. and you need `data=payload` instead of `params=payload`; as `params` is applied to an URL as urlencoded parameters, like this: `GetDiagnosticFile?filename=string`; not as POST body
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.3612	I agree with <@Suellen> - don't set Content-Length by yourself (it's not the character count)
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Either way, the request I tried posting; should have returned any response?; It was just hanging forever until I added timeout.
	0.0	0.511	0.489	0.8248	likely, yes; but it's best to test with a correct request
	0.0	0.876	0.124	0.4019	Can I use a process pool to run a function on a list lists that modifies values and returns the updated list of lists?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Myong>, I'd guess you would have to think about how you map out the work there.
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	<@Glinda> better than nothing :))
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hmm
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what's the response body?; maybe there's a hint
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	; Invalid internal server?
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.1027	:o
	0.0	0.906	0.094	0.3612	I'm guessing something like this may work... Split the list into n equal parts where n = num of workers Then submit each list to be worked on
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	^^ same thing I was thinking; can you operate on each list in the "master" list?
	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.7096	What do you mean; I can access and take values then modify them and return a different list; then `del()` the old one to save memory
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.3612	is your structure like `[ [ ],[ ],[ ] ]` ?
	0.0	0.385	0.615	0.1531	Yeah; BUT
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	if so, each process/thread can work on each list and modify them in place (I think).
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	pool knows which process so submit to
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.0772	You want to distribute work evenly? 
	0.0	0.949	0.051	0.1154	`[master_list[len(master_list) / num_workers * n : (len(master_list) / num_workers * n+1) - 1] for i in range(num_workers-1))]`; If the syntax works that should be okay but there may be some quirks; I will do some quick test
	0.0	0.778	0.222	0.6908	I would go about it the same way. To get stuff done, I’d try without distributing work and then optimize like you’re doing. 
	0.0	0.256	0.744	0.4404	Good point
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'd do 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Even if more sublists than workers for now?
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.3182	The executor maintains a job queue, why would you invent one outside of the pool by chunking the input?; Sure
	0.0	0.37	0.63	0.6249	Yeah you have a good point
	0.059	0.903	0.038	-0.1531	I have an idea for a project I want to start, but every time I get a computer in front of me I don't know what to do. ; Any tips for jumping this mental barrier? 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	start small and iterate over it
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.152	0.848	0.0	-0.2584	Hah. I'm not even sure how to start with the design; I guess that doesn't matter. Cli.py can be refacotrd 
	0.0	0.58	0.42	0.4404	I hope `small.start` is a generator <@Suellen>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	of course it is; we can make our own rules!
	0.0	0.922	0.078	0.4927	<@Collette> I can either submit a list of items to be processed which can be a bit long OR I can submit a single job at a time via `executor.submit()`. Which would be more beneficial? Many smaller jobs OR few very large jobs in comparison
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	bigger chunks -&gt; less overhead
	0.0	0.615	0.385	0.3612	I like trying to scale "horizontally"
	0.09	0.752	0.158	0.3794	if you want speed with ProcessPoolExecutor:  try to reduce the amount of data transmitted Giving each worker a huge data structure and getting it back is generally not good Giving a small piece of data so that each worker completes in about 0.1s is generally not good too
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	It really depends on what your worker function does
	0.0	0.808	0.192	0.6124	Sounds good. The worker function checks at a certain index in a list if it exists, then have some Regex that grabs a piece of it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And which pool you're using
	0.0	0.9	0.1	0.1695	<@Myong> if you'll chunk the data by cpu cores, don't forget about grouper recipe from <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html>
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	eli5: when would you guys use processpool vs. threadpool? what's the core difference?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	And try switching to ThreadPoolExecutor - it may reduce execution times significantly
	0.0	0.84	0.16	0.2263	I think it's based on IO and CPU usage; Okay will do
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Collette> GIL though
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	GIL only applies to bytecode execution
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	What should i be using groupby for?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	doesn't kbman intend to compute stuff massively?
	0.107	0.893	0.0	-0.34	If you do lots of math via numpy or `math` (which are basically C), you may be avoiding GIL at all
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm, for the most part, only doing regex
	0.154	0.641	0.205	0.2023	But it's a pretty crazy regex token though it picks up everthing I need
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.6369	oh? lemme see that regex pattern I love me some regex; unless you already posted it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)`; It catches all floats and integers
	0.0	0.722	0.278	0.4019	all your values have the `e` for exponent?
	0.196	0.804	0.0	-0.296	No they do not I am gonna get rid of that
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yeeee
	0.216	0.784	0.0	-0.296	It was just from stack overflow; no ngetatives either
	0.0	0.775	0.225	0.4404	i threw it at <https://regexr.com/> it's my go to for easy tests
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d` this works
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what about `1`; it wont pick it up
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	o
	0.0	0.659	0.341	0.6901	breaking regexes is clearly more interesting than fixing this bug i should be fixing
	0.214	0.719	0.067	-0.4333	Not sure where that one is messing up; It doesn't match any single digit number; no bueno
	0.0	0.737	0.263	0.6124	easy enough; Will that provide the same output; or does that create another group with `re.finall()`
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	no it works actually; gives me a single list
	0.0	0.789	0.211	0.7096	nice, i still think there's an elegant way to do that; what if you delete that last `\d`; i think that's what makes it require 2 numbers
	0.0	0.584	0.416	0.6448	almost positive; `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?` as opposed to `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d`
	0.0	0.656	0.344	0.9022	Yeah the thing is that I need to catch decimals also; The original very first one does exactly what I need; and it's actually pretty quick; We shall see I appreciate the help
	0.0	0.699	0.301	0.6808	Hi everyone, I was wondering, is there a good place to find help for locust related scripts?
	0.026	0.816	0.158	0.8333	what do you guys like for a minimal queuing system? I am not sure if we need the "distributed" nature of something like celery yet. But if its an easy setup it could be fine. I also saw RQ as well. I am going to try a minimal example setup for processing some work in python through a queue and using docker. we are trying to rewrite a portion of our stack from node.
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.6946	i used python-rq for a long time but after learning celery i probably would have just used celery.; the Python Cookbook has some really good examples too.; if you want something minimal.
	0.072	0.718	0.21	0.6601	ok cool. so celery is easy to get setup? ill have to check out the cookbook; does celery need redis? using docker, would it need to talk with a redis container for storage?
	0.09	0.859	0.051	-0.3182	I was curious about the function return type annotations. My Python book used them throughout but I almost never seen it in real code, is it some thing that is generally ignored?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	celery needs some kind of broker.; you can use redis or rabbitmq.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh i was thinking rabbitmq was synonymous with celery
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	nope, it’s a broker. they are often used together so probably why you thought that.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	ah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when you instantiate celery you pass the connection string to the broker.
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.6124	hmm. in node theres a library called `kue` which is nice since we just import it, and it talks to redis directly to handle the queue.; ah ok.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	when using the decorator, it puts the funtion into the queue based on when it does I/O ?; or just when the function is called
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	the latter, wherever you decide to use it in code you will have `.delay()` method.; my_async_function.delay()
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	oh wait, with the config. i think i see. so the config is basically scheduling these "loaders" to run at given intervals?
	0.0	0.312	0.688	0.296	ah ok.
	0.185	0.815	0.0	-0.3612	if you’re not running anything on a schedule you can ignore all that.
	0.0	0.603	0.397	0.6436	ok. so thats more like running it as a cron setup?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, you can use cron syntax or some others iirc.
	0.0	0.556	0.444	0.5859	sounds like it would be achievable in celery.
	0.0	0.975	0.025	0.0772	so the "thread" is run and looks to see if anything needs to be processed. if it does, it preps it, then starts up to 10 threads to do the work.; those threads doing the work, we just want as workers to monitor a queue to see when work needs to be done.
	0.0	0.667	0.333	0.5423	ok cool. so why did you switch from RQ to celery?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	we use celery in a lot of our other apps so it was to remain consistent.; i was the outlier using RQ.
	0.0	0.698	0.302	0.3818	ah. are there benefits to using RQ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it’s “simpler”.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	would it do what I need in your opinion based on what I described?
	0.274	0.726	0.0	-0.7615	celery is often touted as having a large learning curve. that’s why i avoided it. but after working with it it isn’t all that bad.
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	ok
	0.0	0.705	0.295	0.7717	yea, i don’t see why not. you may need to do a quick spike to see what you like best.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea.; so how is celery "distributed" ? looking at their page.; so you can have multiple instances replicating each others queues?; mostly, the threads that run and to the processes are long running and take time.
	0.0	0.869	0.131	0.6072	a larger process takes about 10 minutes. some times more. it takes about 10 hours to run them for all clients. and its done daily; ah ok. you cant do that with RQ?; or as easily?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea. that was my thought; i just spin up workers based on need or load. and they have thecode. and just look to see what work needs to be done.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	as long as they can all talk to the same broker it should work.
	0.156	0.722	0.122	-0.1531	what about failover. if the queue container breaks or fails. how is that handled?; ok.
	0.324	0.676	0.0	-0.34	you get a bunch of rabbitmq errors.
	0.106	0.688	0.206	0.0516	ah, or i suppose what if the broker fails.; ok.; we want to prevent lost jobs; well, we have to
	0.1	0.785	0.115	-0.128	you can have celery retry a task a number of times.; if it keeps failing you can setup a dead-mailbox or something like that.; you can also have celery send an email.
	0.0	0.937	0.063	0.2732	well, i mean if celery goes down. or, in this case, redis since its the backend store; hmm; i suppose if it goes down, we can re-run the main worker to rebuild the queue.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	its a finite amount of work (that would get larger as we get more users) but its that they are long running.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i got you. celery has what are known as signatures, chains, and groups, you can use these to execute your tasks in particular ways.; a chain for example will execute tasks in order and only when the first one completes.
	0.0	0.167	0.833	0.6124	ok. thats nice.
	0.0	0.446	0.554	0.7351	for monitoring: <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html>; flower is pretty sweet.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea, you would need to run a persistent redis.
	0.0	0.868	0.132	0.4939	i just havent done this much yet for deploying all this.; would it save data to s3 or just a mounted volume or something?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	i think redis has its own thing
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yea it’s called RDB. <https://redis.io/topics/persistence>
	0.0	0.574	0.426	0.5358	ok. basically we cant afford to lose data.
	0.0	0.841	0.159	0.1779	yea, says the RDB can be stored on amazon s3
	0.232	0.768	0.0	-0.2057	is the current thing not working well?
	0.102	0.898	0.0	-0.4767	I have a module with a `def main():` block i’m trying to call this module from another file using the context trick (<https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod/blob/master/tests/context.py>) in my tests folder i’m trying to say module.main() and it’s telling me it’s not callable. any pointers?

	0.0	0.892	0.108	0.8105	Hi, I have a list of boilerplate strings (to be contained in a file) and when a new message comes in, I have to check if this message contains any of the  boilerplate strings and replace with ( "" ). The file containing the boilerplate string will change as new ones will be added. How best do I do this search to be efficient? Will regex be enough for this?
	0.0	0.874	0.126	0.0772	it depends how many boilerplate strings you want to test
	0.095	0.905	0.0	-0.4288	Quick one, I am looking to replace WK30 in this str()  but the week will change each week, so I'm not sure how i can search for WKXX, any ideas?
	0.0	0.818	0.182	0.4404	Regex?; Will be easy if the string is always formatted in the same way
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you can find the index of `WK` in the string and replace that and the 2 next letters
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`/(WK\d\d)/`
	0.0	0.121	0.879	0.807	Great thanks guys!
	0.095	0.638	0.267	0.7678	I was able to make progress on my holiday project! I need help with writing a readme and naming the thing; I would also love to publish on PyPi, as an example, but I'm afraid everyone will laugh at my bad code
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	Works wonders thanks guys
	0.041	0.726	0.233	0.9344	Ha, i’ve been laughing at my code for years; i guess that means i’m learning; so the project takes a jinja template, and an yaml input file and uses the values from the input file to template out the yaml file. it will also allow undefined variables, and reading from environment. i took a lot of inspiration from `envtpl` and `jinja2cli`; is this a.) useful? anyone want to help me name it? i called it `jtpl`; and i hate it
	0.103	0.707	0.19	0.2975	well I suppose it's at least useful to you if you created it and it's always new stuff to learn; I'm also very bad at naming things so can't hep you
	0.0	0.781	0.219	0.5411	i share my code all the time. it’s not always at it’s best but at least i’ve shipped it!
	0.177	0.566	0.256	0.4915	i actually really like that; most of the other tools won’t do yaml either; which is a crying shame; Thank you very kindly, i am going to steal that. and if i ever get a stable thing i’ll credit you for the name
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I'm looking at something over 400 lines ; Each string can have 100 characters 
	0.053	0.901	0.046	-0.1027	Hi guys I have studied about life time of local and global variables I had seen a few examples like if it's defined outside function block it's accessible only during the function execution if not it will be accessible throughout code execution my question here is how I can verify and visualize this any idea ?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	yajinja?; yaml + jinja2 = yajinja
	0.141	0.645	0.215	0.2589	haha. very good.; i’m not sure yet. i’m leaning towards yajinja
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	can you split on ====?

	0.0	0.357	0.643	0.6597	ohh, i like <@Suellen> answer better.
	0.0	0.833	0.167	0.1531	Ok but how to keep it reading the lines?
	0.0	0.545	0.455	0.3612	something a bit like this
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.6908	Nice I was doing with only if and while, for is much better.; Thanks I knew it would be something simple I was not thinking of
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it's just a template, I presume the actual format is somewhat different
	0.0	0.856	0.144	0.2144	Yes but dropping in the for lets me iterate through as I need.
	0.0	0.673	0.327	0.6531	Sigh...  So there's an option for that???  Okay, good because this is 3.6+ 
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what are you trying to do ?
	0.167	0.833	0.0	-0.2023	seems risky to install something with `-e` not in a virtualenv
	0.087	0.722	0.192	0.6893	apparently now I've tripped over a bug in pip from 2013, time to do this more manually and move the repo into 3.6 and install without -t; my whole dev box is a virtualenv, lol, okay, that was more of a nervous laugh about playing fast and loose
	0.535	0.465	0.0	-0.3182	fast AND loose
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	it will be in 3.7 so I'm "trusting" that; orr..... install 3.7 and import it, duh, come on simmons!
	0.013	0.812	0.176	0.9457	Anyone recommend a forum software for bug reporting/feature request? It is alright if it takes up the entire site as I can just style the forum site to look like the other, but I would prefer it didn't since I would want to have user login info shared between the main site and the forum.   Or would you recommend I jut build one myself (general forums should function similar to a multi-user blog which I feel confident in my ability to build). Either way I will still have a contact form, so I might not even need a forum but I still wanna look into it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	github issues?
	0.0	0.909	0.091	0.3612	It would mainly be for the non tech person so they probably won't be familiar with github (although I totally forgot about github for things like this)
	0.087	0.75	0.163	0.34	Hmmm one of those (particularly trello) sounds good, but I am not too familiar with it at the moment; I like Jira but the budget will probably say no
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	GitHub has projects now
	0.0	0.699	0.301	0.6808	yeah, github projects will _sorta_ replace Trello; but Trello is way friendlier for non-tech people
	0.2	0.8	0.0	-0.544	hm.. I always thought of them as the same practically; not really great either of them
	0.0	0.423	0.577	0.6249	oh, trello is great
	0.0	0.951	0.049	0.25	Alright I shall look into those two and trying to connect or use them via an api with the site then. And yea, I have used trello before and it rocked, just never thought of using it as a forum on another site
	0.0	0.534	0.466	0.8338	i probably wouldn't go that route but that's just me; good luck

	0.045	0.837	0.118	0.5542	Hey if I have a small application with a very minute number of users which uses a database to store information on each user, is it best to load in user details into memory on the system on startup for each user I have to avoid many database queries?
	0.142	0.71	0.148	0.0258	small application with small # of users? sounds like you're already avoiding too many queries
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Simple enough
	0.079	0.921	0.0	-0.4767	if you do start to have database contention there are things you can do. you could cache some queries, work on some of your indexes, etc.; but it’s probably too early to be worrying about all that.
	0.123	0.589	0.288	0.746	Yeah, it's a very simple system, I just wasn't sure about what the best practice is. Figured just sticking with the queries alone would be better
	0.0	0.877	0.123	0.2732	Guys what's the max length that we can use to create a variable in python any idea ?
	0.08	0.777	0.143	0.1376	79 characters; that's just a joke on PEP-8, not sure what you mean <@Bette>; do you mean the number of characters in a string?
	0.35	0.65	0.0	-0.5106	No; Max length of a variable name; Is there any restriction?
	0.111	0.889	0.0	-0.2498	This SO article indicates there isn't one but I wouldn't be surprised if some implementations added restrictions <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16920835/what-is-the-maximum-length-for-an-attribute-name-in-python>
	0.281	0.719	0.0	-0.5106	I read that there is no restriction and it can be any reasonable length
	0.075	0.8	0.125	0.2058	I have also tested a variable name with length 80; I didn't get any errors; Little dark tough
	0.213	0.787	0.0	-0.4019	You'll have trouble using `for` and `2good` as variable names though
	0.0	0.82	0.18	0.296	yep `for` is a reserved identifier because it's used for `for` loops
	0.0	0.822	0.178	0.1531	and I believe the `2good` is unusable because it starts with a number; which Python prevents
	0.101	0.771	0.128	0.1376	I made a thing, and i’d like some feedback. I’m not sure if this is the right place; <https://github.com/whereismyjetpack/yajinja>

	0.095	0.784	0.121	0.5747	<@Devorah> if you're up for learning, the reading of the errors and parsing a bunch of dicts within a list within a dict is a great way to practice indexing and key/value iteration and searching, on the other hand, this has been solved long ago and if it doesn't interest you, can you skip for now or forever; <@Marco> welcome, if you are going to paste a lot of code, please click the plus on the side of the text bar and input the code there.  The `with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:` block is written to close down the `with` block when the process is complete, you could use a `while True:` block to keep the program alive though that is rough as it does not have a condition for closure.
	0.031	0.89	0.08	0.8879	Hi.  I am brand new to this group, so I hope I am not making any mistakes.  I am not a heavy programmer, but I am trying to help my father with an issue.  He is working on a camera built with a Raspberry Pi and Python for taking picture of a retina. The problem is that the code he has always saves the picture with the same name.  Thus, if you take a picture, it writes over the previous picture.  It should instead save each picture with a new name.  Also, at the end the script shuts down the camera, rather than letting you take multiple pictures without restarting the program.  Below is the code.  How can I change it to fix these problems?  If I should post this somewhere else, please let me know.  Thanks.    import time import picamera import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM) GPIO.setup(17, <http://GPIO.IN|GPIO.IN>, GPIO.PUD_UP) # GPIO 17 is the shutter button GPIO.setup(22, GPIO.OUT) # GPIO 22 is the infrared cathode GPIO.setup(23, GPIO.OUT) # GPIO 23 is the white light cathode GPIO.output(22, False) # Sets the infrared cathode to ground. The common anode of the  # LED is set to 3.3 V, so setting GPIO 22 to ground causes the  # infrared light to be on. GPIO.output(23, True) # Sets the white light cathode to 3.3 V  with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:     camera.start_preview()     GPIO.wait_for_edge(17, GPIO.FALLING)     GPIO.output(22, True)     GPIO.output(23, False)     camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image1.jpg', use_video_port=True)     camera.stop_preview     GPIO.cleanup()

	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	are you converting to dict or json?
	0.0	0.928	0.072	0.4767	the data needs to be a string i need to pass in, so i get a dict object and i do a json.dumps(dict) which gets me this ^^, but the api wants the value of null to not have doublt quotes; just be from `"null"` to `null`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I wonder why...
	0.239	0.761	0.0	-0.296	i have no clue; this is in fact a first
	0.207	0.793	0.0	-0.2716	it's very strange to have a `"null"` instead of `null`
	0.0	0.476	0.524	0.296	ok, that’s werd
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	I see this
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.34	probably because the value is a string and not `None`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	in the dict, if you do `dict_variable['secondEmail']`, is it a string or `None`?; because if its a string, then that’s your issue.  you should use `None` instead
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	let me check; its a string
	0.0	0.827	0.173	0.4522	that’s why; so if you want `null` to be output in the json serialization, you should have that value be `None`
	0.0	0.734	0.266	0.4404	OHHH; <@Meg> thats why; That makes sense,; thanks a lot
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Also I couldn't able to understand the method any in tuple
	0.1	0.9	0.0	-0.395	Python 3 does not allow that either - there are two issues - one you are trying to assign to an integer literal, and two variables cannot begin with numbers; I don’t know what the environment is that seemed to allow it, but it’s incorrect behavior to allow it
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Hi jkelly; I am trying it from a python 3.6 in a website; It works there and it's not working in 2.7
	0.245	0.755	0.0	-0.5472	I would stop using this website then, it’s not using a true python interpreter; what website is it?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Python <http://tutor.com|tutor.com>; I got your point regarding variable rule
	0.09	0.794	0.116	0.128	yeah perhaps they are doing something weird with the variables before passing them to an underlying interpreter.
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Do you know about python any method; I'm scartaching my head to understand it
	0.0	0.695	0.305	0.8442	yes, essentially it ensures that at least one value in an iterable evaluates to `True`; a related method is `all`, which assures that all values evaluate to `True`
	0.0	0.609	0.391	0.8402	Yeah. Read it but in the example; The output is  True false true false; I'm wondering how
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.3612	it’s basically the same as a function that is like this:  
	0.0	0.823	0.177	0.4215	It would be nice if you can explain me the output of above code
	0.0	0.794	0.206	0.6369	the reason is python has a concept of “truthiness” - essentially values like 0, None and False all are roughly equivalent in boolean comparison
	0.0	0.485	0.515	0.6486	Like how it was true or false
	0.0	0.663	0.337	0.6808	and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, etc. and of course True are all True
	0.0	0.746	0.254	0.7303	But in case 1 and 3 0 is there and still return true ?; Because we need atleast one true ?; Am I right ?
	0.0	0.467	0.533	0.7906	exactly; if *any* value is true, then it returns true
	0.274	0.726	0.0	-0.5994	No problem; at least for me, it’s not something I use often, except when writing tests
	0.0	0.71	0.29	0.5994	that’s always a good idea.  are you by chance going through the list here? <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>
	0.084	0.916	0.0	-0.296	No mate; There is a site called <http://programiz.com|programiz.com> which is containing all most all methods for string tuple set dictionary list in a plain and simple manner
	0.149	0.851	0.0	-0.4215	How would I write a unit test for this decorator function? ; I'd have to mock both `redirect` and `json.loads`
	0.126	0.766	0.108	-0.1027	Why mock redirect?; You could check a return value, which is probably a response object with a correct status code and `location`
	0.061	0.917	0.021	-0.5334	hey guys! wondering if someone could help me out with performing a regex replace; I am trying to do a case insensitive search and insert &lt;b&gt; html tag before and &lt;/b&gt; html tag after every match; right now I have code which does that but the problem is it replaces the actual word with the case of the search word instead of keeping the case in each scenario; content = "Test tEst TEsT" pattern = re.compile("test", re.IGNORECASE) content = pattern.sub("&lt;b&gt;{0}&lt;/b&gt;".format(word), content) #returns "&lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;" #want "&lt;b&gt;Test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;tEst&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;TEsT&lt;/b&gt;"
	0.0	0.791	0.209	0.4404	<https://regexr.com/>; Have you used this before?; Actually this one is better; <https://regex101.com/>
	0.178	0.728	0.095	-0.507	So your problem; there's a cerrtain word you want that is case insensitive; if you find such pattern  `.....{pattern}...`; you want to replace with; `.....&lt;b&gt;{pattern}&lt;/b&gt;...`
	0.087	0.913	0.0	-0.0857	right; but I don't want to replace {pattern}; which is what my code does right now
	0.0	0.767	0.233	0.6486	regex is fine; if you want an easy way; ; First conver to lowercase for both; Then use string methods to find all matches.; Use the found location indices
	0.0	0.825	0.175	0.1779	right I was thinking that...; would regex be cleaner though?
	0.0	0.885	0.115	0.5267	Now you might ask, well isn't it slow to remake a string?; It really depends; So if you know of that solution. Let's work on the regex one.; ; You should probably use; groups instead of string formatting;

	0.0	0.835	0.165	0.3353	hmm; so that creates a group test_word which contains every case-insensitive instance of "test"?
	0.0	0.795	0.205	0.8625	Lastly here is another way that might be helpful; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/16720705>; using `(?P&lt;name&gt;pattern)` creates a named group where you can reference with `name` and searches for the word `pattern`; Another thing that's helpful; is regex matches in python are objects; which contain some useful attributes; <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects>; specifically 
	0.104	0.616	0.281	0.68	wow that's pretty cool!; I'm getting an error when trying to implement the second option. says invalid group reference
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Which one?; Uhh; might be you're referencing `\1` all times?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	you mean it would be \2 for the second match, \3 for the third, etc.?
	0.0	0.715	0.285	0.9737	; maybe something like this; one sec; <@Glenda> this is why: `Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl.`; It's only getting the first value.; ; ; <@Harry> you want the area under free response curve?

So inside "dependency-http-httpclient" i will have a file called "xyz.py" with a "def do_build(params)".

	0.088	0.912	0.0	-0.2584	<@Johnsie> plenty of ways: * setuptools based one: <https://packaging.python.org/guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins/> * from flask authors: <http://pluginbase.pocoo.org/> * <http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/> * <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stevedore> * <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pluggy/0.6.0> and others that aren't that easily googleable
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But the folder is outside the tool, the tool is installed by pip and the folder can be in any place. It will works?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Nope, and it generally shouldn't.; It is a nightmare, to maintain plugins that aren't managed by python import system

	0.545	0.455	0.0	-0.34	<@Ryann> shoot it
	0.04	0.929	0.03	-0.1531	Okay so I have a django form which takes in a keyword as input; I then pass the keyword to a python script; The python script is a google adwords api script that adds a keyword to a campaign; My question is how do pass I the updated django model to a function in a script; Also the keyword argument that is passed is going to be making a change in a object
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	How exactly you do that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	But you pass the new keyword already to the main function, no?; I see now you simply don't use that parameter at all
	0.0	0.828	0.172	0.4019	Yes my question is how do i use the parameter to update the keywrod1 text
	0.0	0.932	0.068	0.4215	<@Collette> Today everything that i need pass from .yml configuration file i need set in an environment variable. But i have a lot of configurations an logic in it, if the user set build_tv_os, so i need compile with one method, if false, with another method, and things like this.; If i can call do_build(param), i can pass everything that i want
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Ryann> You iterate over `new_keyword` list and construct dictionaries from `Keyword` instances
	0.0	0.863	0.137	0.2263	okay let me try that; I only have 1 keyword; Do i still have to iterate
	0.127	0.762	0.111	-0.1685	<@Ryann> then you shouldn't do `Keyword.objects.all()`; Sounds scary; I'm not sure why would you need an environment variable if you already have a .yaml file. Can't you define a variable's value within that .yaml file as well?
	0.228	0.772	0.0	-0.4497	Man, the tool read entire file, but the isolated script not

	0.0	0.917	0.083	0.4019	Hi guys can someone explain me whats the difference between; new_list=list vs new_list=list[:]; As per my understanding the values of list is assigned to new_list,but what is the [:] means here ?
	0.24	0.76	0.0	-0.5849	it's a very bad idea to name one of your variables `list`, `dict` , `str`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	what <@Ciera> said.  To your specific question, new_list = list means they point at the same underlying data, where as `list[:]` copies the contents of `list`; <http://henry.precheur.org/python/copy_list.html>; that explains it with pictures.
	0.0	0.787	0.213	0.5023	<@Ciera> I got your point but I followed a website example ,it was written like that
	0.184	0.593	0.223	0.1027	they do seem to have nice illustrations of your program. could be good for beginners. But yeah, sites that have bad example code should be banned

	0.126	0.549	0.324	0.7351	Yeah, certainly at least in the case of yesterday it actively caused some confusion, and yeah using builtins as variable names is definitely something to be avoided.
	0.039	0.961	0.0	-0.2617	With new_list = list, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and list refer to the same list after the assignment.; Where as new_list=list[:] you can actually slice it but is a weird syntax and dosen't make any sense.

	0.135	0.595	0.27	0.3612	Yeah, and they should be returning a status response.; But it's easier to ignore I guess.
	0.0	0.861	0.139	0.2732	I did have it every 30 seconds and it would do it as well too
	0.14	0.842	0.018	-0.8402	What you should do for the responses is check if there's an error section. Scroll down that link I posted above with a sample response with an error ; And implement some try catches, exception handling and response code checks; I would suspect you're getting a number of error responses, and the api is just shutting you off as a result ; what’s the difference?; can’t see anything; oh, you have the docstring inside
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.296	Yeah
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	hmm
	0.096	0.808	0.096	0.0	not an error; it's just pycharm being pycharm; See also: `callable object is not callable`; yes; function is obviously callable, right?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Yup
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2013-May/020357.html>
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.6696	cool thanks!
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	whats your code?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	Within pycharm... Myabe something to do with docstrings, wraps and decorators?; I could do this ; This is more of a learning excercise
	0.0	0.878	0.122	0.3313	have you looked into functools.partial ( <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial> )?  I honestly have never implemented it, but it *may* be appropriate here?
	0.0	0.278	0.722	0.6369	Thanks that looks cool.
	0.0	0.92	0.08	0.0772	you might also want to look at the `collections` module and/or use propriety instead; and `defaultdict`
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	propriety?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do you have local changes you need to keep ?
	1.0	0.0	0.0	-0.296	no.
	0.0	0.905	0.095	0.296	ok, do `git stash`; and then `git pull`; assuming you’re on the master branch, or whatever branch you need to be on
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	and i've thought about deleting my local copy but.... stash?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	or nuke the directory and clone again (but you won't learn anything)
	0.0	0.821	0.179	0.7876	<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash>; &gt;Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	0.872	0.128	0.3612	could you paste the output of `git status` it looks like you are in process of doing a rebase
	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	do a `git rebase --abort` and after another `git status`
	0.092	0.777	0.131	0.2052	lex@lana:~/Development/Python/PyCharm/pyslackers-com/website$ git status On branch master Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. nothing to commit, working directory clean
	0.0	0.784	0.216	0.296	ok. then assuming the `pyslackers` remote is named `upstream`
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4019	yes
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	`git pull upstream master`; and then to sync your fork on github `git push origin master`
	0.111	0.718	0.171	0.1901	 but this leaves a `This branch is 3 commits ahead of pyslackers:master.` on GitHub.; thanks for `git stash` <@Meg>; Or am I just supposed to ignore that?
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<https://github.com/pyslackers/website/commits/master>
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.3818	j/k
	0.0	0.855	0.145	0.7269	ok so `git checkout master` (just to be sure); then `git fetch upstream` (just to be sure bis); `git reset --hard upstream/master` to clear your master and use the upstream (pyslackers) one; `git push origin master --force` to push your local master to your fork
	0.315	0.286	0.399	0.1511	no man. thank you!
	0.0	0.887	0.113	0.5106	you learn somthing every day; and git (or whatever VCS) is one of those things you do need to be comfortable with especially if you’re on a team
	0.0	0.602	0.398	0.6486	take care to create a new branch before doing any modifications
	0.0	0.741	0.259	0.743	yeah. I've been after this for a couple of days. tried reset, just hadn't used `--hard`. anyway, you guys are awesome.
	0.0	0.508	0.492	0.4404	Today I will try. Thanks. 
	0.0	0.939	0.061	0.6322	Does anyone know of a good project structure for a sanic application?; I'm thinking about doing a straight copy of whatever flask would do.; New question, how does everyone here use pytest for REST apis?  I ask because I have things such as test_update_user that needs me to  - Setup a test user in the database via `post(/api/user, data=new_user_data)` - Perform test on user update via `put(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;, data=updated_user_data) ` - Teardown the test user via `delete(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;)`  I don't really know how to consolidate the Setup and Teardown aspects of this into a fixture.
	0.0	0.895	0.105	0.25	this might be overkill and I honestly haven't used it but I heard about this on pybyes podcast <https://taverntesting.github.io/>; <https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/52/call-your-apis-with-uplink-and-test-them-in-the-tavern>
	0.057	0.803	0.14	0.5423	Hello. I'm new to python and am a bit puzzled about using virtualenv and was wondering what the current best practices are surrounding that, especially for beginners
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	<@Sherley> I'm being a *bit* simplistic but the norm is virtualenv for everything.  If you use more than one version of Python, it becomes very handy, especially when you start using the switches/options.
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.4019	<@Seema> has virtualenv been phased out in favor of docker?
	0.0	0.839	0.161	0.5927	<@Sherley> I'd say start with `pipenv`. It has its quirks, but for an end-user it works better than just plain virtualenv
	0.0	0.769	0.231	0.2732	Or is it still accepted to use virtualenv
	0.0	1.0	0.0	0.0	docker is a whole different story
	0.0	0.891	0.109	0.4215	Depending on your philosophy and desires, you can use both together or just a virtualenv.  They are not the same though can accomplish similar tasks
	0.069	0.931	0.0	-0.3182	From what I understand, the point of virtualenv is to keep each project and its dependencies isolated; Which incidentally also coincides with my understanding of docker's purpose.. Or at least its central one
	0.051	0.709	0.239	0.9524	Docker creates composable environments while virtualenv creates a virtual environment, installing to a virtualenv is isolated from the system but available after deactivation.  Docker images are created, calling the same image next time will create the original environment; There are other advantages and disadvantages.  Are you developing for yourself?; The pros often come down to how you want to manage dependencies, system files, and whether you are sharing the environment.  Virtualenv really does take care of the majority of the issues in a simpler fashion; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe>
	0.0	0.838	0.162	0.4019	<@Seema> The project that I was interested in is an open source project I found on GitHub
	0.134	0.719	0.146	-0.1901	Ok. It recommends virtualenv but is missing explicit directions on how to use it in the readme, <http://GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art|GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art>
	0.0	0.783	0.217	0.8271	Like Malinoff said, you can use other virtualenv, either way, you'll create an environment, clone the repo, then pip install -r requirements.txt; The command will change depending on the program of course; (Off for the night, gn, good luck)
	0.0	0.0	1.0	0.4404	Thanks
