Hey guys for my django web app I'm trying to figure out why my page went from working to a page not found error. It's saying: Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL: .... Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page. but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked.

I have something seemingly complex and puzzling. I’m trying to add dynamic localization to my library which also powers a REST API.

Ex:    I’m trying to do this by running within a context switcher:    But I’m getting this opaque error and can’t figure out how to isolate it    The interesting part is that it works on the first call to foo but not the second. My guess is that something is going on after the `yield` which screws the system up, but I’m not sure where, why, or how to ask the right question; OH MY GOD. I’ve been testing this in the REPL. I have a function which returns a boolean that gets “thrown away”, but the REPL assigns it to `_` which overwrites the global `_` set by `gettext.install()`; Thoughts on how to make gettext REPL-safe?

I agree that the *from future* is quite useful for all of the people who use Python 3 already, but I'm less convinced of the *with open() as f* context manager.

However I _do_ think a file context is useful when writing a file as part of a larger operation, so you can indeed force it to close (and flush to disk).

Thank you all for the input! I really appreciate it. I will be implementing lat/long as query params. On a side note, with SQLAlchemy, what would be the best data type for storing a lat or long? I was going to use a float but I'm not sure if that's overkill.; <@Meg> Oh, I was weighing the pros and cons of float vs. decimal. With `asdecimal=True` does this mean I'm using a decimal, or is this some kind of float/decimal hybrid?; Ah, ok, I got it. Thanks!! Is your recommendation of decimal due to its accuracy?; <@Gabriele> Oh wow! I was doing all the geo stuff from scratch, not realizing there could be something like PostGIS! I was still figuring out an efficient method for finding records with locations within a certain distance of a specific lat/long, but I guess PostGIS can already do that.; <@Ciera> Yep, not sure why it didn't even occur to me.

Hello,  I would like to test a system with several AMQP consumer/producers that are exchanging messages with each other. I would like to have unit-testing with those consumers. Is there a commonly used design pattern for doing so in Python? (I'm using pytest at the moment with a fixture that look like this:; At the moment my set-up is this: My consumers inherit from multiprocessing.Process and when started set-up their AMQP environment. When the test is finished, the terminate closes the connection and cancel everything. The problem that I get is that even when a test completed, the Process of the consumers seems to continue running in the background even after I called terminate.  How could I have a nice clean-up when the test is over? Would it change something to have BlockingConnection instead of a SelectConnection ?

Where if you make the length arbitrary and encourage longer passwords, it adds a lot of cracking time. The NIST recommendation was to support up to either 128 or 256 char passwords I believe.

It's weird that anyone thought it was a good idea to start demanding special characters, because most people are just going to add 1 of them to meet the requirement, whereas simply making the password longer by a few characters would have a stronger benefit with no effect on how easy it is to remember	It's weird that anyone thought it was a good idea to start demanding special characters, because most people are just going to 1 of them to meet the requirement, whereas simply making the password longer by a few characters would have a stronger benefit with no effect on how easy it is to remember	0	1	[]	['add']

Check against the common password (approx 30% of people have a password from the top 10,000) 4. Check of entropy  5.

Hey guys. Newbie here! (just posted in the introduction channel!) I'm building my first web app where the user logs in using his twitch account. I implemented python social auth for django (<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django> ) and it works fine.  Now I want to add custom attributes to the SocialAuthUser model. I want to get the values for these attributes from the user's social account (twitch), so I'm gonna do a get request to twitch API using the access token I got on login/registration. My question is, how do I extend the SocialAuthUser model and add the get request to twitch in the pipeline?  more specifically: 1. How do I add custom fields to the SocialAuthUser model 2. In what .py file and in what class, method or function do I do the get request to get the data to populate the custom fields?   Hope the question makes sense. :slightly_smiling_face:  Thanks!

Design question for you guys.  Not sure what is considered the correct way to do this in python  I have 2 types of output files (s3 and fs).  I have created a class for each.  I have a script which actually creates the data and then writes it to the output files (obviously the s3 and fs classes are abstracing out the differences between the two).  I have been debating if it is better to pass the class of the output file in, or pass a generator function in which can create the output format.  At first was leaning towards the class, but the more I think about it, the more I am leaning towards a generator function.    Multiple output files are created by the script which is why I can't just pass an actual instance of the object.	Design question for you guys.

I know how to write unittest, mock things .etc but I don't really know how to do testing before code when  I'm not sure what will fit best. For example when I'm using paramiko to do some sftp staff I simply can't predict every thing I do because I don't really know this lib enough. (Well, I know paramiko, this is just example :D) When I'm trying stuff and checking how it works... well I'm ending up with already created solution... and then pre-testing is becoming a post-testing which shouldn't be done in TDD  halp :confused:	Hello, I have mind problem with TDD using mock.

<@Carie> I think you'd generally do best by "wrapping" the external lib and then testing those functions, you can define a noop function and write tests around it (obviously they fail immediately). Then you integrate the external lib into those functions (so none of your main app code uses the external lib, since that's an "implementation detail") and keep going until it's passing.	<@Carie> I think you'd generally do best by "wrapping" the external and then testing those functions, you can define a noop function and write tests around it (obviously they fail immediately).

Would it be worth it to take the time to install Ubuntu, learn how it works and how to set up the hosting or would I be perfectly fine just staying on Windows with PyCharm (here though, I am quite scared about the moment where we will have to deploy in production xD) Thanks!

Anyone know how it's possible to run a function in a class through a subclass with multiprocessing? So I have a `class tracker` which I'm calling with a subclass called `class Track(tracker)`.   I then have a list containing many subclasses: `Track`, I would like to call a function and give the same input "an image" to each subclass `Track` by using multiprocessing.  Currently it is working using:    And then i can extract the information from each Track using a call to `pos = listOfTracks[i].get_position`   When I'm trying to add multiprocessing to it, I never receive the updated position, but I can see the image I input is different, but it seems like it's not saving or updating as before, since the `Tracks.get_position` call always return the same position.

Okay. It's still a bit confusing to follow, partly because you have commented out code in there which doesn't look like it would ever do the right thing, such as each tracker creating its own Pool, or calling amap which doesn't seem to be a documented function; I'd recommend maybe writing a similar test case where you replace the dlib stuff with a dummy function of your own choosing, and verify whether that works correctly or not.

anyone here with bulk indexing in solr experience?  I have a project coming up in which I have to index about 10 million web pages on S3 as well as an continual average of 20k or so per week.  Objects in the celery bucket are like `/bucket_name/$db_id/path/to/file.ext`  Distributor task - take in a folder ID and get all html files from the folder, recursively Single-page index task - Responsible for indexing one single web page, started from parent task above  Using Celery, my workflow is like this: 1. Query db for IDs of records and chunk to distributor celery task 2.

Hey guys, any of you guys know mongodb? I'm trying to make a query but I'm not able to find a way.  I need to sort a collection with a triple of its fields but no matter what I do I can only manage to sort by the first element.    Do you have any idea why? Already went to check the *$sort* operator page on MongoDB manual and although they say it works with two fields, I don't seem to be able to replicate the functionality.  &gt; "This operation sorts the documents in the users collection, in descending order according by the age field and then in ascending order according to the value in the posts field."

so my use case here is indexing many web pages on a S3 bucket.  The initial task gets called with the db ID of the S3 folder to be indexed.  Inside `run`, it gets a list of all `htm(l)` files with the db ID prefix.  I've defined another task that takes in a single S3 key URL and extracts the title and non HTML text using beautifulsoup, and insert into Solr.  What I want to do afterwards is to run a task to check Solr for how many documents for that particular DB ID were indexed.  The number of pages indexed are saved to a db field,   If 98% of all pages were indexed, then it's recorded as a success.; <http://www.pythondoc.com/celery-3.1.11/userguide/canvas.html#group-results> seems to fit my needs	so my use case here is indexing many web pages on a S3 bucket.

Short answer: Web crawling just indexes the information using bots, where as Web scraping aka web data extraction is an automated software technique of extracting information from web.

Thanks for the help, man. When you say “Run a chron job on the server” i assume you mean to do the web scraping? Unfortunately I’ve smashed my head against it but I just can’t get my webscraping to work with my remote server. It’s been a huge sticking point for me, making me spend ~10 minutes a day just to do the web scraping on my machine with Selenium.  Part of the issue is the site I’m scraping. No API, and to quote a programmer friend who checked it out: &gt; I don’t see an xml request being made when the export button is clicked so I’m thinking they’re storing the data in cookies via JavaScript and then the export page is reading the cookies on the server side. Or it’s some kind of cool React shit that I don’t know about.  So my selenium script has to click through the buttons one at a time and download a CSV from the site.  I tried to get it up and going on my ubuntu server, but I couldn’t get firefox up and running well.	Thanks for the help, man.

<@Patty>, <@Collette> got a q about using redis as a backend for celery.  I have a ton of short lived tasks executing as part of a chord with a callback afterwards.  Due to the way a chord works, each task needs to return a result, which is saved in the task key in redis.  Over the weekend, got this error message in redis:   `Can't save in background: fork: Cannot allocate memory`,   with corresponding errors in the celery workers:    I'm running this on a AWS T2 small instance with 2GB RAM, and there's about 2.5M keys in the redis db.

Your format string does not include anything that specifies what should be done with the timezone part of the string you're trying to parse; If you know it will always be utc you can probably just add `+00:00 to the end of the format string, otherwise you will need to take care of it before calling striptime; There's also the `%z` formatting option but off the top of my head I don't know if that applies to to both `+0000` and `+00:00` or only `+0000`	Your format string does not include anything that specifies what should be done with the timezone of the string you're trying to parse; If you know it will always be utc you can probably just `+00:00 to the end of the format string, otherwise you will need to take care of it before calling striptime; There's also the `%z` formatting option but off the top of my head I don't know if that applies to to both `+0000` and `+00:00` or only `+0000`	0	2	[]	['add', 'part']

I've found creating helper functions has been helpful with that; But you are right that it has the potential to cause security concerns with poor data sanitzation; I don't have the real data behind SQLAlchemy slow-downs, but if you profile, you'll see that each time you do a select for example, it has to take a general data structure in and output a string. Because it's so generic though, there seem to be a lot of extra calls; Sounds like a good weekend project :slightly_smiling_face:	I've found creating helper functions has been helpful with that; But you are right that it has the potential to cause security concerns with poor data sanitzation; I don't have the real data behind SQLAlchemy slow-downs, but if you profile, you'll see that each time you do a select for example, it has to take a general data structure in and output a string.

Well `request.GET` permits lookup by key - so why repack them just to check for the one necessary, then just unpack them again anyway? You could just `request.GET.get()` or `[string] in request.GET` and remove most of that top code I'd think. I would check for the required field and leave immediately without any other processing personally. Also, if you want to use **kwargs, you could provide a mapping between kwarg and value then just provide them if they exist, if you are interested in making it more terse, since you are just ANDing things in your filter and exclude cases e.g.     Can't these be grouped into a `filter` too: `Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home')`.

To answer your original question, use `sorted(a_list)` instead of `a_list.sort()`.  The first returns a new list and the latter mutates the original (hence returns None).; If you are setting the background image with css then just add `background: url(image-url)` to the inline style of the element representing the background; its because in the below `ThreadType.ROOM` is passed as the `uid` to the Group superclass, and then uid is passed as the participants value.  You then also pass the participants in the kwargs dict.   	To answer your original question, use `sorted(a_list)` instead of `a_list.sort()`.

part of the problem with converting pdfs is you have to rely on heuristics; since in that file, each and every word there is simply composed of single characters with font, letter and possition information; PDFs don’t have the concept of structure that you can easily parse; unlike word/openoffice documents; so, to be honest, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find a solution to work for all your documents; in fact, I’d be surprised if there’s a better than 90% success rate, particularly giving the sheer variability of ways that PDF authoring software outputs the files	 of the problem with converting pdfs is you have to rely on heuristics; since in that file, each and every word there is simply composed of single characters with font, letter and possition information; PDFs don’t have the concept of structure that you can easily parse; unlike word/openoffice documents; so, to be honest, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find a solution to work for all your documents; in fact, I’d be surprised if there’s a better than 90% success rate, particularly giving the sheer variability of ways that PDF authoring software outputs the files	0	1	[]	['part']

Yeah, Mark, it is likely that `crunchy_json` does absolute imports; You may have to do the `pip install -e path/to/my/version` route; That installs it in "editable" mode (kind of like a symlink) and as you make changes in the lib it will reflect in the other environment you import it into; (note you will need to re-import it)	Yeah, Mark, it is likely that `crunchy_json` does absolute imports; You may have to do the `pip install -e path/to/my/version` route; That installs it in "editable" mode (kind of like a symlink) and as you make changes in the it will reflect in the other environment you import it into; (note you will need to re-import it)	0	1	[]	['lib']

Unfortunately, at this time there are already many freelancers with a similar skillset to yours and we cannot accept your application. I know this news is likely disappointing to you. However, we want to make sure the freelancers we accept have the best chance at success on our platform. This requires us to not only closely review a freelancer’s talents and experience, but also balance those with the availability of projects. For example, at times our marketplace may have too many freelancers with similar skills competing for the number of projects that are available. To avoid the frustration that goes along with that, we must limit the number of new freelancers that can join our website. While you cannot submit proposals for jobs right now, the number of available jobs and freelancers vary throughout the year. We can offer a few suggestions for going forward: If you have more relevant skills or experience to add now or in the future as you develop them, you can update and re-submit your application and we’ll take another look to see if there is a demand for your new skills.

<@Kenny>  The first would probably to be break those classes out into more than one file called `core.py`. With a name like core it makes me think that they were going to add more files/break up the core file but then just didn’t. The second would be all of the cryptic class names. I guess if you know the field/datasets they make sense, but they don’t to me. The names themselves would be fine, but they don’t have a single doc string in the whole file. My other nitpick is the gratuitous use of whitespace.

yeah, but i thought running that async would just let me to proceed; basically, i have a Bot() class that is doing something with the received message, a TestMachine() class which is generating a lot of bots with random parameters and an Interceptor() class which connects to the socket (so `connect_socket()` is part of Interceptor() ). i don’t want to pass the bot collection to the interceptor, and i dont want to create a socket connection for every bot…; if that makes sense; if it was js or something i could call the bot on the message receive event, but here i am stuck	yeah, but i thought running that async would just let me to proceed; basically, i have a Bot() class that is doing something with the received message, a TestMachine() class which is generating a lot of bots with random parameters and an Interceptor() class which connects to the socket (so `connect_socket()` is of Interceptor() ). i don’t want to pass the bot collection to the interceptor, and i dont want to create a socket connection for every bot…; if that makes sense; if it was or something i could call the bot on the message receive event, but here i am stuck	0	2	[]	['js', 'part']

Anyone has some advice on the following and how to solve this: - There are 2 suppliers for a company with completely different API’s (one is XML over https, the other is WSDL with SOAP) - Each supplier has a set of actions (Push an order, Get order status, Get return, Get Stockcounts). - Each of these actions requires different mappings depending on supplier - An action always has two things, “Map to the correct format”, “Get/Push the data from/to the API”  I’m trying to create some abstraction so it’s easy to add more suppliers later but I’m not sure how to do it..

OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.  The goal: Take a list of list of strings (results of a query from a SQL database), (hopefully) compress it, and ship it to an Azure blob storage as .tsv files.  All in memory.  The azure-storage library has a create_blob_from_stream option which I've successfully used to send a `io.BytesIO` stream (without compressing) and it works as intended, although I think it could be cleaned up.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding the various pieces of the `io` standard library and want to get some suggestions on how to improve things.  I can't seem to get the compression working (tried zipfile and gzip) and I run into issue where I'll open(..., 'w') the GzipFile/ZipFile, write contents to it, but then can't send it to blob because it doesn't have read access (because I opened it with write to add to the compressed file?); Trying to keep it as lightweight as possible since it's going to be running on an RPi (hence the trying to avoid writing to disk aspect); The compression might be optional if the overhead of compressing isn't worth doing it (to lower the bandwidth), I was going to test doing it with/without and see if it was worth the tradeoff in time spent sending it to blob uncompressed vs compressed).  I can't imagine the overhead is a lot but I honestly have no clue and I'm trying to not prematurely optimize before needed.  Would love thoughts from anyone who's more familiar with this stuff	OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.

Hi everyone, I'm using sqlite3 and I have a column I want to be unique. I've set the unique constraint on it so now I get an sqlite3.IntegrityError thrown when I try and add a duplicate item, which is what I want.   Now I'm making a webscraper, and as I find new things to add to my db, I want to make sure they're not already in my db. My first thought is that I can just use a try/catch as my way of telling whether it's unique or not. My question is whether this is a good idea or not. I can't really articulate why, but it  just feels to me like this isn't really the intended use of try/catch and it's a bit hackish. Is using try/catch in this way a bad design choice?; I mean I can loop through the table or whatever and check like that, but it feels like that's going to be slower than the exception way	Hi everyone, I'm using sqlite3 and I have a column I want to be unique.

(is there any way to clean up process when the task is done ?)   thanks in advance .

What could have been the issue there is that `flags` refers to the parsed arguments rather than the parser itself since the google code you posted has the `parse_args` function being called directly on the `ArgumentParser` instance, whereas you need to call `add_argument` on the parser itself.  So you could save the `ArgumentParser` to its own parser variable, then add your custom arguments, and then call the `parse_args` yourself rather than in the spot its called in google's example	What could have been the issue there is that `flags` refers to the parsed arguments rather than the parser itself since the google code you posted has the `parse_args` function being called directly on the `ArgumentParser` instance, whereas you need to call `add_argument` on the parser itself.

Unfortunately, the metrics in one data set is not the same metric used as the Kaggle data set (I wanted to use the same time metric’s).. How should I go about this issue? Should I work on converting one data set metric to the same metric that i’m using..? Or should I only use the data that fits the time metric?

I told him I havent in many years but I can learn anything…  My first though was powershell, and my second was, wait, why not python…. I think its just a matter of moving files around on the network but I don’t have project details yet..  So any thoughts on were one tool is better than the other?	Hi, quick question.

I'm going to assert (from past experience) that it's much easier to ask the domain admin to create an account in order to authenticate with AD.  Python can connect to the LDAP directory, query, and authenticate though you're asking python to "be" a windows user and depending on how the AD is setup, you/domain admin might get (weird) errors about the ticket system or use of resources or other arcane stuff; and to troubleshoot you'll have to dig through event viewer logs on the server to figure out why you can X but not Y; PowerShell has 20+ years (from mmc console) of getting passed the TGT (more fun Windows trivia).

Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.  I'm trying to identify an item based on the name given in an a Description. There are about 25-30 possible items and each possible item has anywhere from 2-20 possible spelling/spacing/wordorder/special characters combinations in the description. For example something like this:    There are overlaps in the description names with other items, so I don't think using any "distance" or other search algo will get me accurate results. Hence why I've resorted to exact name matching. (If you disagree maybe I could give you some more examples and I could look into it more.)  originally, I put these all the possible names in one large dictionary with the function to call as the value. I didn't really like how long and ugly the list was and difficult to maintain (as I find new possible items or terms are added) so I'm wondering how ugly/slow using a long list of `if/elif desc in ITEM_LIST` might affect my program (as long as it doesn't add more than a second I think I'll deal with it) or if there is another alternate (possibly even obvious) method I can use to identify these items (each with different calculations that need to be performed). And route them to the appropriate (now) methods.	Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.

You can use the `itertools.product` to find combinations of the `range(n*(n-1)/2)` and `range(np.sqrt(n*(n-1)/2)`; And because the product is symmetric, at the end you can reverse all the pairs you have found and add them to the solution set; ie. if `(a, b)` is a solution, then so is `(b, a)`.

Hi everyone, I started to implement a simple web service for image processing in Python 3.6.3. High throughput is very important, because we do real time processing. The concept is very simple - download image from azure blob storage -&gt; resize -&gt; apply some filters -&gt; response.  So I used Flask for the first prototype, after few load tests I realized that we need something asynchronous, so I switched to Tornado. But the problem of overloading still persists, I have only ~77% success requests for 250 concurrent users, which is sad (I use visual studio online load tests). I use single core VM for testing, on another similar VM I run our existing resizer written in C#, which handles loads perfectly with 100% request rate (tho single request is much slower). The logs don't have any failed requests, which means that the failed requests didn't even come into the web server request pool... I use docker container BTW, and odd thing is that CPU has ~65% load idle, tho the python processes consume 0% idle... This is my first ever web Python experience, so I'm frustrated a little bit, may be some help would be appreciated. Could it be a problem of Tornado? Docker? Should I try Sanic or japronto? Should I use another layer over built in web server in Tornado?	Hi everyone, I started to implement a simple web service for image processing in Python 3.6.3.

<@Marco> Because the script is already importing `time`, you could just follow same convention that most other camera software use: timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.

Hey bud, if you could use code formatting.; ; Another thing, your function `fun` is doing way too much.

The ezored project file has a lot of configurations from user, and build.py cannot see until i send as environment variable. So im searching a way to call a function inside build.py file, like "do_build(param)" that i can pass everything that i need as a dictionary. I cannot use import because the tool and the dependencies are in different directories, ezored is a pip package and depenencies can be any directory on user machine. What are the options in my case?
